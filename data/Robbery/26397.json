In two of the cases were violation of probation\nproceedings based on new charges filed in the third case. We consolidated\nthe appeals. As to the new charges, Defendant contends the trial court\nerred by: (1) failing to conduct a proper Melbourne 1 analysis to a\n\n\n1   Melbourne v. State, 679 So. 2d 759 (Fla. 1996)\n\fperemptory challenge by the State; and (2) violating Defendant\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment confrontation right by allowing the State to introduce a 911\ncall. We affirm on the Sixth Amendment issue without discussion. But\nbecause we agree the trial court did not comply with Melbourne, we reverse\nDefendant\u2019s convictions and sentences and remand for a new trial on the\nnew charges. The ultimate question we answer in this case is whether the\nMelbourne procedure is always a three-step process, or a three-step\nprocess if requested. We determine that the Melbourne procedure is indeed\nalways a three-step process. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and\nsentences as to the violation of probation proceedings.\n\n                                    Background\n\n   In Case Nos. 13011816CF10A and 13012248CF10A, Defendant was\ncharged with violating probation, based in part on three counts of robbery\nwith a firearm and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon filed in\nCase No. 14013212CF10A. The new charges proceeded to a jury trial.\n\n   During jury selection, the State exercised a peremptory challenge on\nJuror No. 10, an African-American male. At Defendant\u2019s request, the trial\ncourt asked the state for a race-neutral reason for the strike. The State\nresponded:\n\n         The State does have a race-neutral reason. [Juror No. 10]\n         indicated that he would prefer CSI evidence.[ 2] Additionally,\n         the Defense has stricken two black females in their first round\n         of strikes. They\u2019ve also stricken black individuals for cause.\n         And this is --\n\nCutting off the State, the trial court stated: \u201cAll right. Okay. I find that\nto be [a] race-neutral reason. I\u2019m going to uphold State\u2019s use of a\nperemptory on [Juror No. 10].\u201d Defendant did not make any further\nobjection or argument at that time. However, at the conclusion of the jury\nselection process, when asked if each side accepted the panel of jurors,\nthe defense advised the panel was not acceptable, in part because the trial\ncourt \u201cdenied my Melbourne vs. State objection to the State striking [Juror\nNo. 10].\u201d\n\n   The jury found Defendant guilty of three counts of robbery with a\nweapon, lesser-included offenses, and not guilty of possession of a firearm\nby a convicted felon.     The court entered judgment and sentenced\nDefendant to concurrent prison terms for the three robberies. The trial\n\n2   \u201cCSI\u201d refers to the television show Crime Scene Investigation.\n\n\n                                          2\n\fcourt revoked Defendant\u2019s probation in the other two cases and imposed\nsentences in those cases. Defendant gave notice of appeal.\n\n                               Appellate Analysis\n\n   We review a trial court\u2019s decision to uphold or deny a peremptory\nchallenge for abuse of discretion. Truehill v. State, 211 So. 3d 930, 942\n(Fla. 2017). As a reviewing court, we must presume that peremptory\nchallenges are exercised in a nondiscriminatory manner. Poole v. State,\n151 So. 3d 402, 409 (Fla. 2014).\n\n   \u201cUnder Florida law, a party\u2019s use of peremptory challenges is limited\nonly by the rule that the challenges may not be used to exclude members\nof a \u2018distinctive group.\u2019\u201d San Martin v. State, 705 So. 2d 1337, 1343 (Fla.\n1997).\n\n      [T]o strike the appropriate balance between a party\u2019s right to\n      exercise peremptory challenges and the attempt to eliminate\n      invidious discrimination in juror selection, [our supreme\n      court] in Melbourne enunciated a three-step procedure to be\n      followed when a party objects to the exercise of a peremptory\n      challenge on the ground that it was made on [an improper]\n      discriminatory basis.[[3]]\n\nHayes v. State, 94 So. 3d 452, 460-61 (Fla. 2012) (emphasis added). Based\non the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in Batson v. Kentucky, 476\nU.S. 79 (1986) and Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995), and Neil-Slappy 4\ncase law, the procedure was stated as consisting of three steps:\n\n      Step 1: Objection and Prima Facie Case\n      A party objecting to the other side\u2019s use of a peremptory\n      challenge on racial grounds must: a) make a timely objection\n      on that basis; b) show that the venireperson is a member of a\n      distinct protected group; and c) request that the court ask the\n      striking party its reason for the strike.\n\n\n\n3 In Melbourne, the Court stated that State v. Neil, 457 So. 2d 481 (Fla. 1984) was\n\u201c[a] seminal Florida case . . . wherein this Court set out a procedure for dealing\nwith racially-motivated peremptory challenges.\u201d Melbourne, 679 So. 2d at 763\n(emphasis added).\n\n4State v. Neil, 457 So. 2d 481 (Fla. 1984); State v. Slappy, 522 So. 2d 18 (Fla.\n1988).\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      Step 2: Race-Neutral Explanation\n      The court must then ask the proponent of the strike to explain\n      the reason for the strike. At this point, the burden of\n      production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come\n      forward with a race-neutral explanation.\n\n      Step 3: Determination of Genuineness\n      If the explanation is facially race-neutral and the court\n      believes that, given all the circumstances surrounding the\n      strike, the explanation is not a pretext, the strike will be\n      sustained.     The court\u2019s focus here is not on the\n      reasonableness of the explanation but rather its genuineness.\n\nSee Melbourne, 679 So. 2d at 763-64; Hayes, 94 So. 3d at 461. In\ninterpreting the true scope of the Melbourne procedure, we will rely on case\nlaw generated by Batson and Purkett and its progeny, especially two\ndecisions from the United States Supreme Court.\n\nStep 3 of the Melbourne (Batson) Procedure\n\n   Defendant\u2019s appeal focuses on Step 3 of the Melbourne procedure.\nRelying on Hayes, Defendant contends the record does not support a\nconclusion that the trial court properly conducted Step 3. Specifically,\nDefendant argues the trial court did not review, analyze, or conduct any\n\u201cjudicial assessment\u201d of the reasons given by the State for striking Juror\nNo. 10; instead, the trial court summarily ratified the peremptory\nchallenge. Additionally, Defendant argues the \u201ccold record\u201d is \u201cdevoid of\nany indication\u201d that the trial court \u201cconsidered or weighed any relevant\ncircumstances in deciding whether the State\u2019s strike was discriminatory.\u201d\n\n    The State responds, arguing a lack of preservation because Defendant\nfailed to raise an issue of noncompliance with Melbourne below. As to the\nmerits of Defendant\u2019s arguments, the State also relies on Hayes,\ncontending that when a defendant objects to the State\u2019s exercise of a\nperemptory challenge, and the trial court upholds the strike, the defendant\ncarries the burden of persuasion that the State\u2019s strike was exercised in a\ndiscriminatory manner. The State contends the record shows the trial\ncourt complied with Step 3. Relying on Lidiano v. State, 967 So. 2d 972,\n975 (Fla. 3d DCA 2007), the State argues that \u201c[t]he trial court is not\nrequired to orally perform its genuineness analysis or to articulate the\nbasis for its ruling.\u201d Moreover, the State contends that because it pointed\nout, in providing its race-neutral reason for striking Juror No. 10, that the\ndefense had stricken two black females in the defense\u2019s first round of\nstrikes, after the State had twice accepted the jury panel including those\n\n                                     4\n\fjurors, the record reflects that the trial court was aware of and considered\nthe circumstances relevant to determining if a strike was improperly\ndiscriminatory and implicitly found there was no pretext in the strike.\n\nSpencer v. State\n\n    Melbourne was decided in 1996. Twenty-two years later, courts still\nstruggle with its proper application. Over the years, the case law has\nfocused increasingly on Step 3 of the Melbourne procedure.               The\nunresolved troublesome aspects of what Step 3 means and what it involves\nis perhaps best demonstrated by our supreme court\u2019s most recent opinion\non the subject, Spencer v. State, 238 So. 3d 708 (Fla. 2018) (\u201cSpencer II\u201d).\nThe Spencer II opinion reveals a divided court on the issue of the\npreservation requirements for a Melbourne noncompliance claim.\nUltimately, all of the justices agreed with the Second District that\nSpencer\u2019s conviction should not be reversed for noncompliance with\nMelbourne. In a plurality opinion, three justices agreed the Melbourne\nnoncompliance claim was preserved. Id. at 718. Two justices concurred\nin result, with an opinion disagreeing that the claim was preserved,\nsuggesting that the court recede from language in Hayes, and readopt the\ncourt\u2019s prior preservation reasoning in Floyd v. State, 569 So. 2d 1225 (Fla.\n1990). Id. at 719-20 (Lawson, J., concurring in result). Two justices\nconcurred in result without an opinion. Id. at 718.\n\n    In Spencer II, the supreme court considered a certified question from\nthe Second District. Id. 3d at 711. On direct appeal, the Second District\nupheld Spencer\u2019s conviction, determining that his claim that the trial court\ndid not comply with Step 3 of Melbourne was not preserved. Spencer v.\nState, 196 So. 3d 400, 401 (Fla. 2d DCA 2016) (\u201cSpencer I\u201d). As to one\nprospective juror, Spencer never asserted the State\u2019s reason for the strike\nwas a pretext. Id. at 410. As to the other prospective juror, Spencer did\nnot object to the manner in which the trial court conducted the Melbourne\nprocedure. Id. The Second District opined that the trial court was not\nrequired to perform a full genuineness analysis on the record every time a\nparty initiates a Melbourne challenge, and if the opponent of the strike\nwants the trial court to determine the genuineness of the reason proffered\nfor the strike, the opponent \u201cmust expressly make a claim of pretext and\nat least attempt to proffer the circumstances that support its claim.\u201d Id.\nat 401. After conducting an extensive analysis of the law regarding Step\n3, the Second District wrote: \u201cIt is true that the trial courts must make the\nthree decisions required by Melbourne if requested, but the parties are\nnot entitled to sit back and have the court go through this process for\nthem.\u201d Id. at 409 (bold emphasis added).\n\n\n                                     5\n\f  The Second District certified a three-part question of great public\nimportance:\n\n      During a Melbourne hearing, when a trial court finds that the\n      proponent\u2019s reason for a peremptory challenge is facially\n      neutral, is it the burden of the opponent (1) to claim the\n      reason is a pretext, (2) to place into the record the\n      circumstances supporting its position, and (3) to object if the\n      trial court\u2019s ruling does not contain adequate findings on the\n      issue of genuineness?\n\nId. at 411.\n\n   The plurality opinion of the supreme court began its analysis with the\nobservation that, \u201c[t]he real issue presented here is whether our decision\nin Melbourne requires a trial court to strictly adhere to the procedure as\noutlined in Melbourne and its progeny.\u201d Spencer, 238 So. 3d at 711.\nRejecting the elevation of form over substance, the plurality agreed with\nthe Second District that strict adherence to the Melbourne procedure is not\nrequired. Id. The plurality sought \u201cto clarify that preservation of an issue\nunder Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69\n(1986), does not require anything more than what we have previously\narticulated,\u201d citing Melbourne and Joiner v. State, 618 So. 2d 174, 176 (Fla.\n1993). Id.\n\n   After discussing a progression of case law from 1984 to 2004, 5 the\nplurality then discussed some of the pronouncements in the Court\u2019s 2012\nHayes opinion. Id. at 712-15. Critical to its position, the plurality relied\non two statements in Hayes:\n\n      [W]here the record is completely devoid of any indication that\n      the trial court considered circumstances relevant to whether\n      a strike was exercised for a discriminatory purpose, the\n      reviewing court, which is confined to the cold record before it,\n      cannot assume that a genuineness inquiry was actually\n      conducted in order to defer to the trial court.\n\nand\n\n\n\n5In chronological order, the cases discussed were: Neil; Batson; Slappy; Floyd;\nJoiner; Purkett; Melbourne; Rodriguez v. State, 753 So. 2d 29 (Fla. 2000); and\nDorsey v. State, 868 So. 2d 1192 (Fla. 2003).\n\n\n                                      6\n\f      We emphasize that under the final step, the step at issue in\n      this case, if the proponent\u2019s reason for the challenge is race-,\n      ethnicity-, or gender-neutral, then the trial court should\n      inquire of the opponent of the strike.\n\nId. at 715 (quoting Hayes, 94 So. 3d at 463, 467). Immediately thereafter,\nthe plurality said:\n\n      Spencer argues that this Court should answer the certified\n      question in the negative because the third step of Melbourne,\n      like Batson, is a decisional step where the trial judge evaluates\n      the parties\u2019 persuasiveness after considering all relevant\n      circumstances. Spencer argues that the preservation occurs\n      in step one that can only be waived as articulated in Joiner v.\n      State, 618 So. 2d 174, 176 (Fla. 1993), by failing to renew\n      objections before the jury is empaneled. Alternatively, the\n      State argues that because the opponent of a peremptory strike\n      bears the burden of persuasion, that burden should include\n      expressly stating a claim of pretext and presenting facts and\n      argument to support such a claim. We agree with both\n      arguments.\n\nId. (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). In rejecting the Second District\u2019s\nopinion regarding preservation, the plurality said:\n\n      Although the Second District acknowledges that \u201c[i]t is\n      unquestionably the better practice for the trial court, having\n      made a determination of neutrality under step 2 of the\n      Melbourne analysis, to ask the opponent whether he or she\n      wishes to challenge the genuineness of the proponent\u2019s\n      reason,\u201d it nevertheless holds that there is \u201cno reason to\n      reverse a judgment and sentence following an entire trial\n      when the trial court omits this step without objection from\n      anyone.\u201d Spencer, 196 So. 3d at 407. We disagree with this\n      statement because it is contradictory to the plain language of\n      Hayes. Hayes, 94 So. 3d at 461 (\u201cCompliance with each step\n      [of Melbourne] is not discretionary, and the proper remedy\n      when the trial court fails to abide by its duty under the\n      Melbourne procedure is to reverse and remand for a new\n      trial.\u201d).\n\n      While we were not \u201cabandoning requirements for full\n      preservation in Hayes,\u201d Spencer, 196 So. 3d at 408, Hayes\n      provides that the trial court has a duty to perform the correct\n\n                                     7\n\f      legal analysis independent of trial counsel\u2019s duty. Hayes, 94\n      So. 3d at 465 (\u201cSince the reason defense counsel offered was\n      facially gender neutral, the trial court was then required to\n      engage in step three\u2014the genuineness analysis.\u201d); see also\n      Batson, 476 U.S. at 98, 106 S.Ct. 1712 (after the prosecution\n      articulates a neutral explanation \u201c[t]he trial court then will\n      have the duty to determine if the defendant has established\n      purposeful discrimination.\u201d); Slappy, 522 So. 2d at 22 (\u201c[A]\n      judge cannot merely accept the reasons proffered at face\n      value, but must evaluate those reasons as he or she would\n      weigh any disputed fact.\u201d). Here, the trial judge performed his\n      duty when he requested a response from defense counsel\n      immediately after the State provided its purported race-neutral\n      reason and before the trial court ruled on the genuineness of\n      the reason.\n\nId. at 716 (alterations in original) (emphases added). Upon that reasoning,\nthe plurality concluded the trial court complied with the Melbourne\nprocedure and affirmed the Second District\u2019s conclusion there was no\nreversible error. Id. at 718.\n\n    While concurring with the result, the concurring opinion viewed some\nof the principles discussed in Hayes and relied upon by the plurality as\ndicta. Id. at 718-20, 724 (Lawson, J., concurring in result). Rejecting the\ndicta, the concurring opinion relied on principles discussed in Floyd,\nwhich requires the opposing counsel to challenge the proffered race-\nneutral explanation to preserve the issue. Id. at 718. The concurring\nopinion felt it was time to resolve the seeming conflict between Floyd and\nHayes, and asserted the Court should recede from the dicta in Hayes. Id.\nat 720.\n\n   Although the concurring opinion did not expressly adopt the \u201cif\nrequested\u201d language of the Second District in Spencer I, the concurring\nopinion appears to have asserted that approach. The concurring opinion\nstated three reasons for agreeing with the Second District. Id. In stating\nthe second reason, the concurring opinion wrote:\n\n      Second, contrary to the assertion in Hayes, the trial judge\n      does not need to \u201cundertake an on-the-record genuineness\n      inquiry\u201d in the absence of any challenge to the race-neutral\n      reason to allow for \u201cmeaningful appellate review.\u201d          As\n      explained in Melbourne, if the opponent of the strike does not\n      make a record from which the trial court\u2019s decision can be\n\n\n\n                                    8\n\f         challenged on appeal as \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d the trial judge\u2019s\n         ruling \u201cwill be affirmed.\u201d\n\nId. at 721 (emphases added) (citation omitted).\n\nPost-Spencer Analysis\n\n   Until a majority opinion by our supreme court says otherwise, in this\nDistrict, we contend there arguably is no conflict between Hayes and\nFloyd. We further hold that the Melbourne procedure is indeed a three-\nstep process, and the intent of our supreme court, in adopting the\nprocedure, was to require that all the steps be followed. We reject the\nnotion that the three-steps are required only \u201cif requested.\u201d\n\n   Our premise is that the three-step procedure stated in Melbourne is\nanalogous to the procedures used by the judiciary to address claims of\ndiscovery violations during a criminal trial and assertions of the\ndefendant\u2019s incompetence to proceed in criminal prosecutions.\n\n    When a claim is made during a criminal trial that there has been a\ndiscovery violation, the trial court must engage in a process of analysis,\nregardless of whether the proponent of the objection requests a\nRichardson 6 hearing. Jones v. State, 32 So. 3d 706, 710-11 (Fla. 4th DCA\n2010) (determining that the Richardson hearing requirement applies to a\npossible discovery violation, even if the defendant does not request a\nRichardson hearing). Likewise, if a defendant in a criminal prosecution\nmakes an initial showing of incompetence to proceed, the trial court must\ntake certain steps before proceeding, regardless of whether the defendant\npursues the matter or not. Dougherty v. State, 149 So. 3d 672, 677-78\n(Fla. 2014) (determining that once a trial court has reasonable grounds to\nbelieve the defendant is incompetent and orders an examination, failure\nto make an independent determination regarding a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency to stand trial is reversible error); Dortch v. State, 242 So. 3d\n431, 433 (Fla. 4th DCA 2018) (determining that once a trial court has\nreasonable grounds to believe the defendant is incompetent and orders an\nexamination, failure to hold a hearing constitutes fundamental error which\ncan be addressed for the first time on appeal). The rationale for imposing\nsuch duties on the trial court is to assure the integrity and rudimentary\nfairness of the proceedings (prohibiting trial by ambush or criminally\npunishing someone who is incompetent).\n\n\n\n6   Richardson v. State, 246 So. 2d 771 (Fla. 1971).\n\n\n                                          9\n\f   In our view, elements of the Melbourne procedure impose a duty on trial\ncourts, separate and apart from the duties of the advocates, for similar\nreasons. That is to say, Melbourne imposes some procedural requirements\nas a duty on trial courts that do not require objections at each step to\npreserve the matter for appellate review; however, with regards to factual\naccuracy of assertions by the proponent of a peremptory strike, the\nstandard preservation requirements apply.\n\n    We conclude that at a minimum, Melbourne imposes a duty on trial\ncourts at Step 3 to request a response to the proffered explanation from\nthe opponent of a peremptory challenge once Step 2 has been completed.\nWe continue to adhere to our prior case law that \u201cthe Melbourne procedure\ndoes not require the trial court to recite a perfect script or incant specific\nwords in order to properly comply with its analysis under [S]tep [3].\u201d Denis\nv. State, 137 So. 3d 583, 586 (Fla. 4th DCA 2014) (citing Hayes, 94 So. 3d\nat 463). We continue to agree with the plurality opinion in Spencer II that:\n\n      [W]here the record is completely devoid of any indication that\n      the trial court considered circumstances relevant to whether\n      a strike was exercised for a discriminatory purpose, the\n      reviewing court, which is confined to the cold record before it,\n      cannot assume that a genuineness inquiry was actually\n      conducted in order to defer to the trial court.\n\nSpencer, 238 So. 3d at 715 (quoting Hayes, 94 So. 3d at 463); see also R.J.\nReynolds Tobacco Co. v. Enochs, 226 So. 3d 872, 874 (Fla. 4th DCA 2017)\n(same); West v. State, 168 So. 3d 1282, 1285 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015) (same);\nDenis, 137 So. 3d at 586 (same); Burgess v.

State, 104 So. 3d 1187, 1190 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012)\n(same). 7 Also relying on Hayes, we have said that \u201c[c]ompliance with each\nstep [of the Melbourne procedure] is not discretionary, and the proper\nremedy when the trial court fails to abide by its duty under the Melbourne\nprocedure is to reverse and remand for a new trial.\u201d King, 106 So. 3d at\n968 (quoting Hayes, 94 So. 3d at 461); see also Welch v. State, 992 So. 2d\n\n\n\n7 The dissent points out that these cases do not involve \u201ca situation in which\ncounsel for the defendant failed to challenge the race-neutral reason.\u201d However,\nthe cases are cited as support for the quote and not to specifically negate the\npremise that Melbourne requires three steps only if the opponent of the strike\ncontinually makes specific objections about the procedure.\n\n\n                                      10\n\f206, 212 (Fla. 2008) (determining a failure to follow Melbourne procedure\nconstitutes reversible error).\n\n    As mentioned, however, we also continue to adhere to our prior case\nlaw that the opponent of a peremptory challenge who contests the factual\nassertions on which the strike is based must comply with the usual\nrequirements for preservation. See Hoskins v. State, 965 So. 2d 1, 9 (Fla.\n2007) (stating that the defendant\u2019s failure to question the facts on which\nthe strike was based waived the issue for review); Denis, 137 So. 3d at 585;\nDoe v. State, 980 So. 2d 1102, 1104 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008) (affirming the\ntrial court\u2019s decision to sustain the peremptory strike because \u201c[d]efense\ncounsel did not challenge the facts on which the strikes were based and\nthus failed to preserve this issue for appellate review\u201d).\n\n   Like the plurality opinion in Spencer II, we disagree with the Second\nDistrict\u2019s premise that \u201c[i]t is true that the trial courts must make the three\ndecisions required by Melbourne if requested. . . .\u201d Spencer, 196 So. 3d\nat 409 (bold emphasis added). In our view, such a premise suggests, at\nbest, that only the first two steps of the Melbourne procedure are\nmandatory. 8 Such a premise ignores that Step 3, in our view, is the\npenultimate decision and raison d\u2019etre for the analysis. Without Step 3,\nthe protection against an improper discriminatory peremptory challenge is\nlost.\n\n    The primary problem with the assertion that the Melbourne procedure\ndoes not always have to be a three-step process is that it ignores what we\ndeem to be key language in United States Supreme Court case law, starting\nwith Purkett. The discussion of the facts in Purkett does not make it clear\nwhat response, if any, Purkett made when the state proffered its race-\nneutral reasons for the preemptory strikes against two black men. What\nis clear is that the Supreme Court said:\n\n      If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must\n      then decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike has\n      proved purposeful racial discrimination.\n\nPurkett, 514 U.S. at 767 (emphasis added). Additionally, the Court wrote:\n\u201cThe Court of Appeals erred by combining Batson\u2019s second and third steps\ninto one. . . .\u201d Id. at 768. Such language indicates that each of the three\nsteps are independently vital and significant.\n\n\n8 However, the Second District\u2019s opinion could also be read to mean that\ncompliance with Step 2 is not mandatory unless requested.\n\n\n                                      11\n\f   Perhaps the strongest argument to be made that the Melbourne\nprocedure is a three-step process that does not require the preservation\nrequirements asserted by the Second District, the concurring opinion in\nSpencer, and the dissent in this case, comes from a review of United States\nSupreme Court case law subsequent to Purkett. Two opinions are\npertinent to our analysis: Johnson v. California, 545 U.S. 162 (2005); and\nFoster v. Chatman, 136 S.Ct. 1737 (2016). From a review of those two\ncases, it does not appear that the Supreme Court requires a specific\npreservation argument to be made to prevail on a Batson challenge;\ninstead, the challenge can be upheld years later, based on the appellate\nrecord.\n\n    In Johnson, although the Court addressed Step 1 of the Batson\nanalysis, it is persuasive here. Johnson was convicted of second degree\nmurder by a California jury. Johnson, 545 U.S. at 164. At trial, he\nasserted a race-based challenge to the state\u2019s preemptory strikes of black\nprospective jurors. Id. at 165. The trial court did not ask the prosecutor\nto explain the rationale for his strikes; instead, the trial court simply found\nthat Johnson had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination\nunder the governing state precedence. Id. The Supreme Court began its\nanalysis by pointing out that in Batson, the Court remanded the case for\nfurther proceedings because the trial court failed to demand an\nexplanation from the prosecutor for the preemptory challenge. Id. at 169-\n70. The Court then wrote:\n\n      [I]n describing the burden-shifting framework, we assumed in\n      Batson that the trial judge would have the benefit of all\n      relevant    circumstances,    including    the   prosecutor\u2019s\n      explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than\n      not that the challenge was improperly motivated.\n\nId. at 170. After referencing the Batson requirement that the opponent of\nthe strike carries the burden of persuasion, the Court then wrote:\n\n      [E]ven if the State produces only a frivolous or utterly\n      nonsensical justification for its strike, the case does not end\u2014\n      it merely proceeds to step three. The first two Batson steps\n      govern the production of evidence that allows the trial court\n      to determine the persuasiveness of the defendant\u2019s\n      constitutional claim.\n\nId. at 171 (footnote omitted) (internal citation omitted). The Court then\nopined:\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f      The three-step process thus simultaneously serves the public\n      purposes Batson is designed to vindicate and encourages\n      \u201cprompt rulings on objections to peremptory challenges\n      without substantial disruption of the jury selection process.\u201d\n\nId. at 172-73 (quoting Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-59\n(1991)). Although it is not clear from the opinion that preservation was\nraised as an issue in the case, what is clear is that the Supreme Court\nenvisioned the first two steps of the Batson procedure as the steps\ninvolving the production of evidence in order for the trial court to conduct\na proper analysis in the third step. It seems implicit in the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s reasoning that if a specific preservation objection is required, then\nit would have addressed the issue of Johnson\u2019s failure to object and secure\na ruling as to Step 2, and conclude the Batson challenge was properly\ndenied by the trial court.\n\n    In Foster, the Supreme Court granted certiorari review of a Georgia\ndeath penalty conviction and sentence. Foster, 136 S.Ct. at 1743. There,\nthe state exercised nine of its ten allotted peremptory strikes, removing\nfour black prospective jurors. Id. Foster immediately lodged a Batson\nobjection, which was rejected by the trial court. Id. After the judgment\nand sentence was upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court, Foster sought\nhabeas relief in state court.      Id.   During the state court habeas\nproceedings, Foster obtained a series of documents from the prosecution\nfiles, clearly suggesting the prosecutor\u2019s office used race in evaluating\nwhich prospective black jurors would be subject to a preemptory strike.\nId. at 1744-45. The state court denied habeas relief based on res judicata.\nId. at 1745.\n\n    Because both sides conceded that Steps 1 and 2 of Batson had been\nmet, the Supreme Court addressed only Step 3. Id. at 1747. Foster\nfocused his Batson claim on two prospective jurors, for whom the state\nproffered multiple reasons during trial for the strike as to both. Id. at\n1748. As to one of the stricken prospective jurors, for whom the state\noffered eleven reasons for the strike, the Court noted that the trial court\naccepted the state\u2019s justifications, concluding that \u201c\u2018[i]n the totality of\ncircumstances,\u2019 there was \u2018no discriminatory intent, and that there existed\nreasonably clear, specific, and legitimate reasons\u2019 for the strike.\u201d Id. at\n1748-49 (alteration in original).       However, based on the Court\u2019s\nindependent examination of the record, it concluded that much of the\nreasoning provided by the state \u201cha[d] no grounding in fact.\u201d Id. at 1749.\n\n   As to the second prospective juror, for whom the state proffered eight\nreasons for the strike, the Court noted that the state\u2019s reasons for the\n\n                                     13\n\fstrike were inconsistent before the trial court, focusing its argument on\nonly one concern, and the state\u2019s justification for the strike shifted over\ntime in the post-trial proceedings. Id. at 1751-52. The Court also observed\nthat many of the state\u2019s justifications \u201ccome undone when subjected to\nscrutiny.\u201d Id. at 1753. Additionally, as to both stricken prospective jurors,\nthe Court noted that many of the proffered reasons applied to white\nprospective jurors, for whom the state did not exercise a strike. Id. at\n1750. Thus, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction and remanded\nthe case for further proceedings. Id. at 1755.\n\n    What is instructive about Foster is that the Supreme Court determined\nthere was a Batson violation on proffered reasons for a preemptory strike\nthat \u201c[came] undone\u201d after an extensive review of the record. If objections\nwere made discussing any details regarding the proffered explanations, it\nis likely the Court would have discussed the objections or alluded to them.\nBecause there is no discussion of such points, it appears the United States\nSupreme Court does not impose a specific objection in order to conduct an\nappellate review of the trial court\u2019s compliance with Batson.\n\nThe Dissent\u2019s Analysis\n\n   The dissent cites ten cases in support of its contention that Melbourne\ndoes not always require three steps, but does require a specific objection\nto preserve a claim of pretext. However, four of the cases were decided\nbefore Purkett. 9 Prior to Purkett, the contention that Batson requires three\n\n9The four cases are: United States v. Arce, 997 F.2d 1123 (5th Cir. 1993); Hopson\nv. Fredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Bennett, 928 F.2d\n1548 (11th Cir. 1991); and United States v. Rudas, 905 F.2d 38 (2d Cir. 1990).\n\nArce is not helpful to the analysis because it relies on Rudas, which is discussed\nbelow. 997 F.2d at 1127.\n\nHopson is not helpful to the analysis because the issue was the failure of the\njudge to articulate the reason for overruling the Batson objection. 961 F.2d at\n1377-78. Neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Florida Supreme\nCourt has ever imposed such a requirement.\n\nIn Bennett, the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cthe government\u2019s articulated reasons are\nnot pretextual as a matter of law. Opportunity to rebut the government\u2019s reasons\nwould therefore have been to no avail. Consequently, we need not address\nBennett\u2019s secondary argument [that the trial court failed to allow Bennett to rebut\nthe explanation] at this juncture.\u201d Bennett, 928 F.2d at 1550 n.1. Clearly, the\ntheory of waiver approved by the Fifth Circuit is questionable, given its conclusion\nthat articulated reasons are not pretextual as a matter of law.\n\n\n                                        14\n\fsteps was only approved by the plurality opinion in Hernandez.\nAdditionally, in Hernandez, the Court said \u201c[o]nce a prosecutor has offered\na race-neutral explanation for peremptory challenges and the trial court\nhas ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination, the\npreliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie\nshowing of intentional discrimination becomes moot.\u201d Hernandez, 500\nU.S. at 359.      As discussed below, that language was erroneously\ninterpreted to mean that once a trial court rules on a Batson objection,\neven without determining if the proffered reasons are genuine, the prima\nfacie showing of intentional discrimination becomes moot.\n\n   The case which appears to be the strongest support for the dissent\u2019s\nposition is Davis v. Baltimore Gas & Electric Company, 160 F.3d 1023 (4th\nCir. 1998), in which the Fourth Circuit said: \u201cThe court has no obligation\nto guide the movant, step-by-step, through the requirements of his own\nobjection.\u201d Id. at 1028. However, Davis does not mention Purkett at all,\nand instead, misapplied Hernandez, which also predated Purkett. Id. at\n1026-27.\n\n   Immediately after stating the quote from Hernandez discussed above,\nthe Fourth Circuit said:\n\n      Fourth Circuit law endorses the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in\n      Hernandez.      Prior to the Court\u2019s pronouncement in\n      Hernandez, the Fourth Circuit held that when racially neutral\n      reasons are proffered, it is unnecessary to determine whether\n      a prima facie case was actually demonstrated. So, since\n      Defendant volunteered racially neutral reasons for its strikes,\n      the prima facie determination is moot.\n\nDavis, 160 F.3d at 1027 (internal citations omitted). In other words, the\nFourth Circuit completely ignored Step 3 discussed in Hernandez (which\nPurkett amplified further) to conclude that a racially neutral proffered\nexplanation ends the Batson inquiry.\n\n   The remainder of the cases cited by the dissent are also unpersuasive,\nbecause in those cases, either the trial court gave the opponent of the\n\n\nThe problem with Rudas is that the Second Circuit asserted that \u201c[o]nce the\nGovernment has offered reasons for its peremptory challenges, defense counsel\nmust expressly indicate an intention to pursue the Batson claim,\u201d with no citation\nof authority. 905 F.2d at 41.\n\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fstrike the opportunity to respond, 10 or at least, there is not enough\ninformation to determine whether the trial court did, 11 or the cases do not\nrely on Purkett and rely on pre-Purkett cases. 12\n\n   The dissent voices a legitimate concern that \u201cthe goal has become the\nprocess.\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor may have expressed the fear best when she\nobserved that by \u201cconstitutionalizing jury selection procedures . . . jury\nselection\u2014once a sideshow\u2014will become the main event.\u201d J.E.B. v.\nAlabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 147 (1994) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).\nNonetheless, it must be remembered that the procedure espoused by\nBatson by a majority of the Supreme Court and adopted in Melbourne \u201cwas\ndesigned \u2018to serve multiple ends,\u2019 only one of which was to protect individual\ndefendants from discrimination in the selection of jurors.\u201d Georgia v.\nMcCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 48 (1992) (emphasis added) (quoting Powers v.\nOhio, 499 U.S. 400, 406 (1991)). As can be seen from the Supreme Court\u2019s\napplication of Batson, much more is involved than a concern about Equal\nProtection under the Constitution. Batson not only preserves Equal\nProtection, but also Due Process, and the Sixth Amendment right to a trial\nby a fair jury.\n\n   In Powers, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether Batson\napplied when a white defendant sought to challenge the state\u2019s use of\nperemptory challenges to exclude black potential jurors. 499 U.S. at 403.\nIn the first paragraph of the opinion, the Court said:\n\n      In the many times we have confronted the issue since those\n      cases [referring to three cases construing the Civil Rights Act\n      of 1875], we have not questioned the premise that racial\n      discrimination in the qualification or selection of jurors offends\n      the dignity of persons and the integrity of the courts.\n\nId. at 402 (emphases added). The majority in Powers went on to say: \u201cJury\nservice preserves the democratic element of the law, as it guards the rights\nof the parties and ensures continued acceptance of the laws by all of the\npeople.\u201d Id. at 407. The majority concluded that \u201cBatson recognized that\na prosecutor\u2019s discriminatory use of peremptory challenges harms the\nexcluded jurors and the community at large.\u201d Id. at 406 (emphases added).\nThe notion that Batson was intended to avoid \u201coffend[ing] . . . the integrity\n\n10 United States v.

Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 156\n(1968)), and in a footnote, where the Court said:\n\n      In Duncan v. Louisiana . . . the Court concluded that the right\n      to trial by jury in criminal cases was such a fundamental\n      feature of the American system of justice that it was protected\n      against state action by the Due Process Clause of the\n      Fourteenth Amendment.          The Court emphasized that a\n      defendant\u2019s right to be tried by a jury of his peers is designed\n      \u201cto prevent oppression by the Government.\u201d For a jury to\n      perform its intended function as a check on official power, it\n      must be a body drawn from the community. By compromising\n      the representative quality of the jury, discriminatory selection\n      procedures make \u201cjuries ready weapons for officials to oppress\n      those accused individuals who by chance are numbered\n      among unpopular or inarticulate minorities.\u201d\n\nId. n.8 (internal citations omitted).\n\n   In McCollum, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the\nConstitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful\nracial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. 505 U.S.\nat 44. There, three white defendants were charged with aggravated assault\nand simple battery against two black victims. Id. In holding that the\nConstitution prohibits criminal defendants from using race for a\nperemptory challenge, the Supreme Court again relied on the premise that\nBatson was designed to serve \u201cmultiple ends,\u201d including protecting the\n\u201cintegrity of the courts.\u201d Id. at 48. As part of the rationale for its holding,\nthe Court said:\n\n      \u201c[B]e it at the hands of the State or the defense,\u201d if a court\n      allows jurors to be excluded because of group bias, \u201c[it] is [a]\n      willing participant in a scheme that could only undermine the\n      very foundation of our system of justice\u2014our citizens\u2019\n      confidence in it. Just as public confidence in criminal justice\n      is undermined by a conviction in a trial where racial\n      discrimination has occurred in jury selection, so is public\n\n\n                                        17\n\f      confidence undermined where a defendant, assisted by\n      racially discriminatory peremptory strikes, obtains an\n      acquittal.\n\nId. at 49-50 (alterations in original) (internal citation omitted).\n\n    Finally, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s contention, agreeing with the\nSecond District and the concurring opinion in Spencer II, that Hayes and\nthe plurality opinion in Spencer II cast the trial judge as an advocate by\nimposing a duty to ask the opponent of a peremptory strike to respond to\nthe proffered explanation for the strike. Although a trial court judge must\nbe impartial, \u201c[t]his fundamental precept does not foreclose a trial judge\nfrom asking questions to ascertain the truth or to clarify issues.\u201d Gerali v.\nState, 50 So. 3d 727, 729 (Fla. 5th DCA 2010). It is not uncommon for\ntrial court or appellate judges to ask questions of an advocate to test the\nstrength of an argument. Judges are trained in the skills of neutrality,\nand we are confident that trial courts can engage in conducting a factual\ndetermination without becoming advocates, if questioning is needed to\nmake a factual determination of pretext.\n\n   The \u201cmultiple ends\u201d the Batson-Melbourne procedure was designed to\nachieve should not be thwarted by the preservation requirements the\ndissent seeks to impose. It is reasonable and appropriate to impose some\nduty on the trial court to accomplish the \u201cmultiple ends.\u201d\n\nApplying the Melbourne Procedure to This Case\n\n   In the instant case, we conclude the cold record is devoid of any\nindication that the trial court considered circumstances relevant to\nwhether the peremptory challenge was exercised for a discriminatory\npurpose. Unlike Spencer II, it is clear that the trial court did not request\na response by Defendant to the explanation proffered by the State for the\nperemptory challenge. Instead, the trial court cut off the State while it was\nproffering its explanation for the strike and justification for its\ngenuineness, and brought the analysis to an end with the statement, \u201cAll\nright. Okay. I find that to be race-neutral reason. I\u2019m going to uphold\nState\u2019s use of a peremptory on [Juror No. 10].\u201d On the record presented,\nwe simply cannot assume that a genuineness inquiry was actually\nconducted in order to defer to the trial court. See Landis v. State, 143 So.\n3d 974, 978 (Fla. 4th DCA 2014) (\u201cIf the record lacks any indication that\nthe trial court considered the totality of the circumstances relevant to\nwhether a strike was exercised for a discriminatory purpose, the reviewing\ncourt, which is confined to the cold record before it, cannot assume that a\n\n\n\n                                      18\n\fgenuineness inquiry was actually conducted and give deference to the trial\ncourt.\u201d).\n\n   The State asks us to infer that the trial court complied with Step 3\nbecause it pointed out to the trial court, in providing its race-neutral\nreason for striking Juror No. 10, that the defense had stricken two black\nfemales in the defense\u2019s first round of strikes, after the State had twice\naccepted the jury panel with those jurors. The State contends that the\nrecord reflects the trial court was aware of and considered the\ncircumstances relevant to determining if the strike was improperly\ndiscriminatory and implicitly found there was no pretext in the strike. We\ndecline the invitation because the trial court cut off the State before it\ncould point out that it had twice accepted the jury panel with those jurors\nwhen it exercised two peremptory challenges. We are satisfied that once\nthe trial court decided the explanation was race neutral, it determined no\nfurther analysis was needed. In other words, the trial court prematurely\ncurtailed the procedure.\n\n   Because the trial court failed to comply with the duty imposed by Step\n3 of the Melbourne procedure, we reverse the conviction and sentence, and\nremand the case for a new trial as to the robbery counts in Case No.\n14013212CF10A. The violation of probation proceedings in the other two\ncases were tried without a jury, thus the error regarding jury selection\ndoes not affect the adjudication that Defendant violated probation in those\ncases. We affirm the adjudications and sentences imposed in Case Nos.\n13011816CF10A and 13012248CF10A.\n\n    We further determine that our opinion in this case regarding the\nprocedure for a Melbourne challenge conflicts with the opinions in Brown\nv. State, 204 So. 3d 546 (Fla. 5th DCA 2016), Ivy v. State, 196 So. 3d 394\n(Fla. 2d DCA 2016), and Hanna v. State, 194 So. 3d 424 (Fla. 3d DCA\n2016), because those cases continue to adhere to the analysis of the\nSecond District in Spencer I. Thus, we certify conflict with those decisions.\n\n   Reversed and remand for further proceedings.\n\nWARNER, J., concurs.\nKUNTZ, J., dissents with opinion.\n\nKUNTZ, J., dissenting.\n\n    After the State used a peremptory challenge on Juror No. 10, counsel\nfor the Defendant stated, \u201cYour Honor, may I -- For the record, my client\nis a member of the African American class and we want-, pursuant to\n\n\n                                     19\n\fMelbourne vs. State, the State to offer a race neutral reason for\u201d the strike.\nThe State responded, stating that Juror No. 10 \u201cindicated he would prefer\n\u2018CSI evidence.\u2019 Additionally, the Defense has stricken two black females\nin the first round of strikes. They\u2019ve also stricken black individuals for\ncause.\u201d Both the Defendant and defense counsel remained quiet before\nand after the court stated, \u201cAll right. Okay. I find that to be a race-neutral\nreason. I\u2019m going to uphold the State\u2019s use of a peremptory on [Juror No.\n10].\u201d\n\n    The State\u2019s stated reason was true. During voir dire, when asked\nwhether he could convict a defendant without DNA evidence, Juror No. 10\nstated, \u201c[I]t depends on the case.\u201d While his answer was more nuanced\nthan a simple preference for DNA evidence, the Defendant did not\nchallenge the reason offered by the State.         I would conclude the\nDefendant\u2019s silence in response to the State\u2019s facially sound reason for\nstriking Juror No. 10 constituted a waiver of the challenge. I would affirm\nthe conviction and respectfully dissent.\n\n    The ultimate issue here is whether a party must raise an issue to the\ntrial court; or, alternatively, whether a party can sit silently and require\nthe trial court to advocate on his or her behalf. The issue relates to the\nmulti-step process for challenging the use of a peremptory challenge.\n\n   In 1986, the United States Supreme Court examined \u201cthe evidentiary\nburden placed on a criminal defendant who claims that he has been denied\nequal protection through the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to\nexclude members of his race from the petit jury.\u201d Batson v. Kentucky, 476\nU.S. 79, 82 (1986). Batson and its progeny have established a three-part\ntest to determine whether a party grounded its use of a peremptory strike\nin a racially discriminatory manner. \u201cFirst, the defendant must make out\na prima facie case \u2018by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives\nrise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u2019\u201d Johnson v. California, 545\nU.S. 162, 168 (2005) (quoting Batson, 476 U.S. at 93-94). Second, if the\ndefendant makes a prima facie case, \u201cthe \u2018burden shifts to the State to\nexplain adequately the racial exclusion\u2019 by offering permissible race-\nneutral justifications for the strikes.\u201d Id. (quoting Batson, 476 U.S. at 94).\nThird, \u201c[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then\ndecide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial\ndiscrimination.\u201d Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 767 (1995).\n\n   Even before Batson, our state supreme court had established a\nprocedure aimed at preventing racially motivated peremptory challenges.\nSee, e.g., State v. Neil, 457 So. 2d 481 (Fla. 1984), later clarified in State v.\nJohans, 613 So. 2d 1319 (Fla. 1993) and State v. Slappy, 522 So. 2d 18\n\n                                       20\n\f(Fla. 1988). Because of difficulty applying those decisions, and because of\nBatson and Purkett, the court resolved to address the issue again in\nMelbourne v. State, 679 So. 2d 759 (Fla. 1996), explaining each step of the\nthree-step process:\n\n      A party objecting to the other side\u2019s use of a peremptory\n      challenge on racial grounds must: a) make a timely objection\n      on that basis, b) show that the venireperson is a member of a\n      distinct racial group, and c) request that the court ask the\n      striking party its reason for the strike. If these initial\n      requirements are met (step 1), the court must ask the\n      proponent of the strike to explain the reason for the strike.\n\n      At this point, the burden of production shifts to the proponent\n      of the strike to come forward with a race-neutral explanation\n      (step 2). If the explanation is facially race-neutral and the\n      court believes that, given all the circumstances surrounding\n      the strike, the explanation is not a pretext, the strike will be\n      sustained (step 3). The court\u2019s focus in step 3 is not on the\n      reasonableness of the explanation but rather its genuineness.\n      Throughout this process, the burden of persuasion never\n      leaves the opponent of the strike to prove purposeful racial\n      discrimination.\n\nId. at 764 (footnote omitted).\n\n   In my opinion, and based on the foregoing case law, a party challenging\nthe use of the other\u2019s peremptory strike must object during the Batson-\nMelbourne analysis at each of the three steps to preserve the objection.\nThe majority disagrees.\n\n   In support of its contrary conclusion, the majority discusses our\nsupreme court\u2019s plurality opinion in Spencer v. State, 238 So. 3d 708 (Fla.\n2018). In Spencer, the defendant raised a Melbourne challenge to the\nstate\u2019s use of a peremptory strike. Id. at 716. The court asked the state\nto provide a nondiscriminatory basis for the strike to which the state\ncomplied. Id. At that time, the court informed counsel for the defendant\nthat \u201cyou may respond\u201d and counsel stated, \u201cI have no response.\u201d Id.\n\n   While all seven justices agreed that the defendant\u2019s conviction should\nbe affirmed, no rationale garnered the support of a majority of justices.\nThree justices signed the plurality opinion authored by Justice Quince;\ntwo concurred in result without a written opinion; and two concurred with\nan opinion. The plurality held the defendant waived his challenge to the\n\n                                    21\n\fstrike when he failed to respond to the court\u2019s invitation. Id. at 717\n(\u201cBecause the burden of persuasion was on defense counsel, as the\nopponent of the strike, and defense counsel did not respond, the trial court\nproperly overruled the objections.\u201d). Generally, the plurality relied on\nHayes v. State, 94 So. 3d 452, 460\u201361 (Fla. 2012), stating that \u201c[w]hile we\nwere not abandoning requirements for full preservation in Hayes, Hayes\nprovides that the trial court has a duty to perform the correct legal analysis\nindependent of trial counsel\u2019s duty.\u201d Spencer, 238 So. 3d at 716 (internal\nquotation omitted).\n\n   Justice Lawson wrote the concurring opinion, joined by Justice\nCanady, and explained that long before Hayes, the court addressed the\nissue in Floyd v. State, 569 So. 2d 1225 (Fla. 1990). Spencer, 238 So. 3d\nat 718-19 (Lawson, J., concurring). In Floyd, the court held that \u201c[o]nce\nthe state has proffered a facially race-neutral reason, a defendant must\nplace the court on notice that he or she contests the factual existence of\nthe reason.\u201d Id. (quoting Floyd, 569 So. 2d at 1229). Justice Lawson\nexplained that the contrary language in Hayes, issued twenty-two years\nafter Floyd, is mere dicta. Id. at 720\u201321 (\u201c[T]here is no practical way for\nthe opponent of the strike to meet his or her burden of persuasion without\nchallenging the facially race-neutral reason as a pretext.\u201d). In other words,\nwhen a defendant remains silent after step 2, he cannot meet his burden\nof persuasion in challenging step 3.\n\n   The majority here agrees with the Spencer plurality and states that \u201cin\nthis District we contend there arguably is no conflict between Hayes and\nFloyd.\u201d Slip Op. 8. The majority states that \u201cMelbourne imposes some\nprocedural requirements as a duty on trial courts that do not require\nobjections at each step to preserve the matter for appellate review;\nhowever, with regards to factual accuracy of assertions by the proponent\nof a peremptory strike, the standard preservation requirements apply.\u201d\nSlip Op. 9 (emphasis removed). Thus, the majority \u201cconclude[s] that at a\nminimum, Melbourne imposes a duty on trial courts at Step 3 to request a\nresponse to the proffered explanation from the opponent of a peremptory\nchallenge once Step 2 has been completed.\u201d Slip Op. 9.\n\n   The majority cites several cases from this Court in support of its\nconclusion. See R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Enochs, 226 So. 3d 872, 874\n(Fla. 4th DCA 2017); West v. State, 168 So. 3d 1282, 1285 (Fla. 4th DCA\n2015); Denis v. State, 137 So. 3d 583, 586 (Fla. 4th DCA 2014); Burgess\nv. State, 117 So. 3d 889, 891 (Fla. 4th DCA 2013); King v. State, 106 So.\n3d 966, 968 (Fla. 4th DCA 2013); Victor v. State, 126 So. 3d 1171, 1172\n(Fla. 4th DCA 2012); Cook v. State, 104 So. 3d 1187, 1190 (Fla. 4th DCA\n\n\n                                     22\n\f2012). But none of these cases involved a situation in which counsel for\nthe defendant failed to challenge the race-neutral reason.\n\n    In Denis, we explained that \u201cafter the state proffered its race-neutral\nreason for the strike\u2014that the juror had fallen asleep during voir dire\u2014\ndefense counsel contested the factual basis of the state\u2019s reason by\ninforming the court that defense counsel did not see the juror fall asleep\nand asking the court to address whether it witnessed this behavior.\u201d 137\nSo. 3d at 585. Similarly, in West, after the state responded that its race-\nneutral reason for using the peremptory strike was that the juror was\nunemployed, counsel for the defendant objected. 168 So. 3d at 1283. The\ndefendant\u2019s counsel stated that \u201c[s]he said she\u2019s a housekeeper for a\nretirement home. Her husband was the one that was unemployed\u2014no,\nI\u2019m sorry, her kids are unemployed, but she\u2019s a housekeeper for a\nretirement home.\u201d Id.\n\n   In King, another cited case, we explained that \u201cthe State sought to\nexercise peremptory strikes as to three African\u2013American jurors. On each\noccasion, the defense objected and sought a race-neutral reason. And, on\neach occasion, the defense took issue with the reasons offered by the\nprosecutor in support of the strike.\u201d 106 So. 3d at 968. The defendant\nalso objected to the state\u2019s race-neutral reason in Victor, where we stated\nthat in response to the state\u2019s proffered reason \u201c[d]efense counsel noted\nthat the State had not moved to strike other members on the panel who\nwere also arrested.\u201d 126 So. 3d at 1173. The same occurred in Cook.\nAfter the state provided as a race neutral reason that the juror was\n\u201chesitant in answering\u201d and \u201cseemed distracted,\u201d counsel for the defendant\nimmediately objected, stating \u201cI don\u2019t think his being slow to answer\nquestions would have anything to do with his qualification to be a juror on\nthe case.\u201d Cook, 104 So. 3d at 1188.\n\n   On its face, Burgess presents a closer case. But there we specifically\nnoted that the \u201cdefendant also pointed out the state\u2019s pattern of\nchallenging black jurors.\u201d Burgess, 117 So. 3d at 891. The opinion also\nstates that the defendant \u201calleged purposeful discrimination.\u201d Id. A review\nof the transcript of the hearing at issue, available from the St. Lucie\nCounty Clerk of Court, shows the defendant\u2019s objection to the state\u2019s\nproffered race-neutral reason was specific. The defendant\u2019s attorney\nstated that \u201cthe State is striking every African-American female so far. So\nI do think that that should be taken a look at when \u2013 when the State is\nsaying that the reason for the strike is simply because these are in the\nprofession of being a nurse.\u201d Counsel for the defendant specifically\nasserted that, \u201cthe court ought to be concerned with what the true\nmotivations are.\u201d\n\n                                    23\n\f    These cases do not support reversal here. Unlike the cases discussed\nabove, the Defendant here did not object to the State\u2019s proffered race-\nneutral reason. Instead, he remained silent. I find similarity between the\nfacts here and R.J. Reynolds\u2014another case cited by the majority. Two\nperemptory challenges were at issue there, though the colloquy about the\nfirst is relevant here:\n\n      [PLAINTIFF]: He\u2019s a white male. I don\u2019t understand what \u2013\n\n      [COURT]: Everybody is a protected class under the case law.\n\n      [PLAINTIFF]: Okay. Well, he\u2019s a smoker, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m\n      striking him, he\u2019s a smoker.\n\n      [COURT]: All right. That\u2019s a gender-and-race-neutral reason. I\n      will overrule defense objection.\n\nR.J. Reynolds, 226 So. 3d at 873. I see little difference between the\ncolloquy in R.J. Reynolds and the colloquy here. Yet we affirmed the\ncourt\u2019s decision in R.J. Reynolds, and allowed the strike based on the\n\u201coverall record.\u201d Id. at 874.\n\n   All but one of the cases relied on by the majority are distinguishable;\nand, as for R.J. Reynolds, that case supports affirmance here. Yet the\nmajority cites them and then imposes a new obligation on our trial judges\nto act as an advocate. Doing so does not serve the purpose of eradicating\nracial discrimination from the jury selection process. Instead, it eliminates\nthe possibility that a party might accept the race-neutral reason proffered\nby the other party.\n\n   Justice Marshall\u2019s concurring opinion in Batson offered a prophetic\nprediction: \u201cMerely allowing defendants the opportunity to challenge the\nracially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges in individual cases\nwill not end the illegitimate use of the peremptory challenge.\u201d 476 U.S. at\n105 (Marshall, J., concurring). He recognized that when a defendant\nestablished a prima facie case, \u201ctrial courts face the difficult burden of\nassessing prosecutors\u2019 motives\u201d and that burden is one trial courts are \u201cill-\nequipped\u201d to handle. Id. at 105-06.\n\n   Twenty years later, Justice Breyer concluded that \u201chistory has proved\nJustice Marshall right.\u201d Rice v. Collins, 546 U.S. 333, 342\u201343 (2006)\n(Breyer, J., concurring). And Justice Marshall is not alone. Justice\nO\u2019Connor has commented that \u201c[i]n further constitutionalizing jury\n\n                                     24\n\fselection procedures, the Court increases the number of cases in which\njury selection\u2014once a sideshow\u2014will become part of the main event.\u201d\nJ.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 147 (1994) (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring). My colleague, Judge Klingensmith, has opined that the\n\u201censuing progression of the current case law has resulted in the death of\nthe peremptory challenge by a thousand cuts.\u201d Jones v. State, 229 So. 3d\n834, 837 (Fla. 4th DCA 2017) (Klingensmith, J., concurring).\n\n   The decision of the majority is yet another cut\u2014one that further\nseparates the procedure carried out in the trial courts from the purpose\nexplicitly stated in Batson and Melbourne. In this district, we will now\npresume that the defendant rejects the state\u2019s stated nondiscriminatory\nbasis for the strike. The Melbourne inquiry moves further from the goal of\neliminating discrimination. Instead, the goal has become the process; the\nsideshow becoming part of the main event. Consistent with the concurring\nopinion of Justice Lawson in Spencer, we should require a party to raise\nan objection at every step of the Batson-Melbourne test.\n\n   This would also track many other jurisdictions that have addressed this\nissue. The Tenth Circuit has \u201crefuse[d] to transform [the defendant\u2019s]\ninadequate effort to respond to the government into an error by the district\ncourt.\u201d United States v. Vann, 776 F.3d 746, 755 (10th Cir. 2015)\n(\u201cLogically construed, the best way to interpret this series of events is that\n[the defendant] failed to carry his burden of persuasion to demonstrate to\nthe district court that the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory strike\namounted to purposeful discrimination.\u201d).\n\n   Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that a party \u201cwaived his Batson\nclaim, however, by failing to rebut the county\u2019s reasons for striking Juror\nNumber Eight at the time he raised his claim.\u201d Wright v. Harris Cty., 536\nF.3d 436, 438 (5th Cir. 2008); see also United States v. Arce, 997 F.2d\n1123, 1126\u201327 (5th Cir. 1993) (\u201cBecause this reason was not facially race-\nrelated and the defense did not dispute that explanation, the district court\nhad no need to rule on its validity.\u201d).\n\n   The same is true in the Fourth Circuit, which has held \u201cthat Plaintiff\nwaived his Batson challenge by failing to pursue his objection once\nDefendant offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation.\u201d Davis v.\nBalt. Gas & Elec. Co., 160 F.3d 1023, 1028 (4th Cir. 1998). The Second\nCircuit reached the same result. United States v. Rudas, 905 F.2d 38, 41\n(2d Cir. 1990) (\u201cOnce the Government has offered reasons for its\nperemptory challenges, defense counsel must expressly indicate an\nintention to pursue the Batson claim. Here defense counsel did nothing.\u201d).\n\n\n                                     25\n\f    In the Sixth Circuit, \u201c[i]f a defendant fails to rebut a race-neutral\nexplanation at the time it was made, the district court\u2019s ruling on the\nobjection is reviewed for plain error, and the movant in this setting is in\nno position to register a procedural complaint that the district court failed\nto give a specific reason on the record for accepting the government\u2019s race-\nneutral explanation. A movant\u2019s failure to argue pretext may even\nconstitute waiver of his initial Batson objection.\u201d United States v. Jackson,\n347 F.3d 598, 605 (6th Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted).\n\n    The Eighth Circuit has also addressed the specific issue presented here.\nHopson v. Fredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374, 1377\u201378 (8th Cir. 1992). That\ncourt held that the failure of counsel \u201cto follow up on his Batson objection\ncould have been reasonably construed by the trial judge as an agreement\nthat the expressed reasons were racially neutral.\u201d Id.; see also United\nStates v. Bennett, 928 F.2d 1548, 1550 n.1 (11th Cir. 1991) (\u201cIn the instant\ncase, however, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not allege that the\ngovernment\u2019s explanation was pretextual at the time the government made\nits explanation for the strikes.\u201d), superseded by statute on other grounds\nas stated in United States v. Smith, 127 F.3d 1388, 1389\u201390 (11th Cir.\n1997).\n\n    A few states follow suit. See Adair v. State, 336 S.W.3d 680, 689\u201390\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (determining a defendant failed to meet his burden\nwhen he did not try to rebut the race-neutral reason provided by the\nprosecutor); People v. Alvarado, 759 N.Y.S.2d 659, 660 (N.Y. App. Div.\n2003) (\u201cWith regard to the other three panelists at issue, by failing, at step\nthree of the Batson application, to raise any arguments as to why the\nprosecutor\u2019s facially race-neutral explanations for his peremptory\nchallenges were pretextual, defendant failed to preserve his present\nclaims.\u201d); State v. Washington, 288 S.W.3d 312, 317 (Mo. Ct. App. 2009)\n(quoting State v. Taylor, 944 S.W.2d 925, 934 (Mo. 1997)) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s\nfailure to challenge the State\u2019s race-neutral explanation in any way waives\nany future complaint that the State\u2019s reasons were racially motivated, and\nleaves nothing for this Court to review.\u201d).\n\n   These courts concluded as they did for the same reason courts require\npreservation in any other instance. A trial court should not pursue\narguments on behalf of a party. Instead, a party must present an\nargument to the court and, when presented, the court must determine the\nissue. There is no reason to blur this established line between the role of\nthe court and those who appear before it.\n\n  The majority notes that four of these opinions predate the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Purkett, and also states that the defendant\u2019s response\n\n                                     26\n\fto the state\u2019s race-neutral reason is unclear in Purkett. But we do know\nthe defendant\u2019s response. On remand from the Supreme Court, the Eighth\nCircuit explained that defense counsel sought to question the prospective\njurors in response to the state\u2019s assertion. Elem v. Purkett, 64 F.3d 1195,\n1199 (8th Cir. 1995). In any event, the courts that issued those four\nopinions consider the opinions to be good law. See, e.g., United States v.\nSanders, 470 F. App\u2019x 380 (5th Cir. 2012) (\u201cBy failing to dispute the\nGovernment\u2019s explanations, Sanders appeared to acquiesce in them.\u201d);\nUnited States v. Whitfield, 314 F. App\u2019x 554, 556 (4th Cir. 2008) (\u201cThe\nfailure to argue pretext after the challenged strike has been explained\nconstitutes a waiver of the initial Batson objection.\u201d); see also Lee v.\nComm\u2019r, Ala. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 726 F.3d 1172, 1230 (11th Cir. 2013) (Tjoflat,\nJ., concurring) (citing Davis, 160 F.3d at 1027; Hopson, 961 F.2d at 1377;\nRudas, 905 F.2d at 41) (\u201cThree of our sister circuits have answered this\nquestion. If, after the State has come forth with non-discriminatory\nreasons for exercising the peremptory challenges at issue the defendant\nstands silent, the defendant waives his Batson objection; he may not\nresurrect it on appeal.\u201d).\n\n   Here, the Defendant asked that the State \u201coffer a race-neutral reason\nfor\u201d the strike. In response, the State came forward with a neutral\nexplanation for striking the juror. The Defendant did not challenge that\nreason. \u201c[W]hen the state asserts a fact as existing in the record, the trial\ncourt cannot be faulted for assuming it is so when defense counsel is silent\nand the assertion remains unchallenged. Once the state has proffered a\nfacially race-neutral reason, a defendant must place the court on notice\nthat he or she contests the factual existence of the reason.\u201d Floyd, 569\nSo. 2d at 1229.
