Krakora, Public Defender, attorney for\n                   appellant (Mark Zavotsky, Designated Counsel, on the\n                   brief).\n\n                   Michael H. Robertson, Somerset County Prosecutor,\n                   attorney for respondent (Alexander Mech, Assistant\n                   Prosecutor, of counsel and on the brief).\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n      Defendant Victor Vasquez appeals from a January 25, 2017 order,\n\nfollowing a testimonial hearing, denying post-conviction relief (PCR) from an\n\narmed-robbery conviction following a jury trial. Defendant argued defense\n\ncounsel was ineffective and prejudiced his right to a fair trial. Applying our\n\ndeferential standard of review, we conclude the PCR court did not clearly err in\n\nfinding that trial counsel provided effective assistance of counsel; and, even if\n\nhe did not, counsel's deficient performance did not prejudice defendant.\n\nTherefore, we affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n      A jury convicted defendant of first-degree robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1(a)\n\n(count one); third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(d) (count three); fourth-degree unlawful possession of a\n\nweapon, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(d) (count four); third-degree aggravated assault,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(b)(2) (count five); and third-degree hindering apprehension or\n\nprosecution, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-3(b)(4) (count six).        Before trial, the State\n\ndismissed count two, charging second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:5-2(a) and N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1(a). After merger, the court imposed a\n\nfifteen-year prison sentence on count one subject to the No Early Release Act\n\n\n                                                                         A-1073-17T1\n                                       2\n\f(NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2, and concurrent four-year terms on counts three\n\nand six.    We affirmed the conviction on direct appeal.       State v. Vasquez\n\n(Vasquez I), No. A-5413-07 (App. Div. Feb. 26, 2010) (slip op. at 17).\n\n      We assume the reader's familiarity with the facts, which we reviewed at\n\nlength.    Id., slip op. at 2-11.   In short, the State's proofs established that\n\ndefendant and a group of other men confronted and robbed three victims on a\n\npublic street at about 2:00 a.m. Defendant wielded a knife, cut one of the victims\n\non the finger and slashed at but missed another victim. Another man had a\n\nbaseball bat. The robbers took a small amount of cash and the victims' baseball\n\ncaps. After police were called to the scene, one victim saw one of the attackers\n\na block away. A pursuit ensued into an apartment building, where defendant\n\nand his cohorts were arrested. Police recovered the knife, the baseball bat, and\n\nthe hats that apparently belonged to the victims.       In show-ups outside the\n\napartment building, the three victims separately identified defendant as the\n\nknife-wielding robber.\n\n      On direct appeal, defendant argued he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel, because his attorney intentionally elicited \"devastating testimony\" that\n\ndefendant belonged to a gang. We declined to decide the ineffective-assistance-\n\nof-counsel issue, concluding it should be raised in a petition for PCR, as the\n\n\n                                                                          A-1073-17T1\n                                         3\n\fclaim might involve evidence outside the trial record. Vasquez I, slip op. at 16-\n\n17.\n\n      When defendant renewed the argument in a PCR petition, the PCR court\n\ndenied relief without an evidentiary hearing, holding that counsel intended to\n\nadvance the defense of \"afterthought robbery.\" According to that theory of the\n\ncase, defendant and co-defendants approached the victims not to commit\n\nrobbery but to \"tussle\" over turf. The theft of cash and hats was an afterthought.\n\n      We reversed, finding a prima facie case of ineffective assistance. State v.\n\nVasquez (Vasquez II), A-0303-14 (App. Div. June 6, 2016) (slip op. at 19-20).\n\nWe described at length the lines of questioning that defendant's counsel pursued,\n\nand his responses to objections from co-counsel and inquiries from the court.\n\nId., slip op. at 7-15. In reversing the PCR court's denial of relief without a\n\nhearing, we noted that when counsel for a co-defendant objected to defendant's\n\ncounsel's line of questioning, and the judge demanded that defendant's counsel\n\nexplain his purpose, defense counsel did not say he was pursuing an afterthought\n\nrobbery defense, let alone explain how his questioning might further that\n\ndefense. Id., slip op. at 18-19. Instead, when asked at sidebar about his line of\n\nquestioning, counsel stated that if he elicited prejudicial evidence \"then so be\n\nit,\" and assured the judge he was acting \"in good faith.\" Ibid. We remanded for\n\n\n                                                                          A-1073-17T1\n                                        4\n\fan evidentiary hearing to determine if these apparently damaging questions\n\namounted to ineffective assistance of counsel resulting in prejudice, and whether\n\ncounsel failed to prepare even minimally for trial. Id., slip op. at 19-20 & n.6.\n\n      At the evidentiary hearing, counsel testified he had, in fact, meant to\n\npursue a defense of afterthought robbery, but that he may also have had other\n\ntactics in mind, including raising doubt that the alleged altercation had ever\n\noccurred. The PCR court found counsel credible and denied relief, concluding\n\nonce more that counsel had adopted a reasonable trial strategy of suggesting that\n\ndefendant approached the victims without the intention to commit a theft, which\n\nhe and his co-defendants committed as an afterthought. The PCR court noted\n\nthat defendant's counsel \"had a legitimate theory of defense . . . [p]robably the\n\nonly theory of defense that he could have used in this particular case.\" In view\n\nof its finding, the court did not reach the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      Though we may have reached a different result, we must deferentially\n\nreview and uphold the PCR court's fact-findings if \"supported by sufficient\n\ncredible evidence in the record.\" State v. Nash, 212 N.J. 518, 540 (2013); see\n\nalso State v. Johnson, 42 N.J. 146, 162 (1964). We recognize that our \"reading\n\nof a cold record is a pale substitute for a trial judge's assessment of the credibility\n\n\n                                                                               A-1073-17T1\n                                          5\n\fof a witness he has observed firsthand.\" Nash, 212 N.J. at 540. On the other\n\nhand, we may reject factual findings that lack support in the record, see State v.\n\nPierre, 223 N.J. 560, 584 (2015), and we review legal conclusions de novo, id.\n\nat 576.\n\n      To support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must\n\nestablish that his attorney's performance was so deficient as to fall below an\n\nobjective standard of competence, and, but for that deficient performance, a\n\nreasonable probability exists that the result would have been different.\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685-89 (1984); State v. Fritz, 105 N.J.\n\n42, 58 (1987). The defendant must prove both prongs by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence. Nash, 212 N.J. at 541.\n\n      Assistance of counsel is ineffective when it \"so undermine[s] the proper\n\nfunctioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having\n\nproduced a just result.\" State v. Savage, 120 N.J. 594, 613, 614 (1990) (quoting\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 686, 696). Defendant must show that \"counsel was not\n\nfunctioning as the 'counsel'\" our federal and state constitutions guarantee. Fritz,\n\n105 N.J. at 52 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687). This requires proof that\n\ncounsel's mistakes were \"of such a magnitude as to thwart the fundamental\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-1073-17T1\n                                        6\n\fguarantee of [a] fair trial.\" State v. Castagna, 187 N.J. 293, 314\u201315 (2006)\n\n(citation omitted) (alteration in the original).\n\n      A defendant has a high bar to meet to \"overcome [the] 'strong\n\npresumption' that counsel exercised 'reasonable professional judgment' and\n\n'sound trial strategy' in fulfilling his responsibilities.\" Nash, 212 N.J. at 542\n\n(quoting State v. Hess, 207 N.J. 123, 147 (2011)). A reviewing court must be\n\nwary of \"the distorting effects of hindsight,\" Pierre, 223 N.J. at 579 (quoting\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 689), and recognize that defense counsel encounters a\n\n\"variety of circumstances\" during trial and a \"range of legitimate decisions\n\nregarding how best to represent a criminal defendant,\" Fritz, 105 N.J. at 52\n\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688-89). Assistance is not ineffective simply\n\n\"because defense counsel could have done better.\" Nash, 212 N.J. at 543.\n\n      The PCR court found that, to support an afterthought-robbery defense,\n\ncounsel sought to elicit testimony suggesting defendants approached the victims\n\nintending not to rob but to tussle, thinking the victims perhaps belonged to a\n\nrival gang. A jury finding that defendant took the victims' property as an\n\n\"afterthought\" would avoid a conviction of first-degree armed robbery by\n\nrendering his original threat with a weapon mere assault and his stealing mere\n\ntheft. That is because the robbery \"statute requires that the threats or violence\n\n\n                                                                         A-1073-17T1\n                                          7\n\fbe carried out in furtherance of the intention to commit a theft.\" State v. Lopez,\n\n187 N.J. 91, 101 (2006). By contrast, \"where a violent fracas occurs for reasons\n\nother than theft, and the perpetrator later happens to take property from the\n\nvictim,\" that taking does not constitute robbery. Ibid. According to the PCR\n\ncourt, counsel elicited that the co-defendants belonged to a gang and had\n\napproached the victims \"in concert\" to advance the narrative that they came\n\ninitially to fight a rival gang \u2013 in other words, to engage in a fracas \u2013 and only\n\nafterwards decided to take the victims' property.\n\n      Given our deferential review of the PCR court's findings, we cannot\n\nconclude that counsel's performance clearly fell below an objectively reasonable\n\nstandard. Notably, defendant does not suggest alternative lines of defense that\n\nwere clearly more promising. We accept the PCR court's determination that trial\n\ncounsel, whom the court found credible, had a specific defense theory in mind\n\nwhen eliciting the testimony in question. 1\n\n\n1\n     Although we affirm the trial court's findings, defense counsel's own\ndescription of his approach raises legitimate concerns. Pressed at trial to justify\nhis questioning, he answered at side-bar, \"[I]f any of my questions solicit the\ntruth, if the witnesses can take the stand, and if my questions somehow cause\nthe witnesses to say something that is prejudicial to my clients, but it is the truth,\nthen so be it.\" While the \"normal trial objective [is] . . . a search for ultimate\ntruth,\" State v. Briley, 53 N.J. 498, 506 (1969), criminal defense attorneys' role\nis to serve not as impartial inquisitors but to fill \"the difficult task of serving\n\n\n                                                                              A-1073-17T1\n                                          8\n\f      Regardless, even were we not satisfied that the record supports the PCR\n\ncourt's conclusion as to counsel's performance, defendant has not proved that\n\nhis counsel's alleged errors caused the requisite prejudice.          To establish\n\nprejudice, a defendant must show \"a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel's unprofessional errors,\" a different verdict would have resulted \u2013 that\n\nis, \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Fritz, 105\n\nN.J. at 52 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). The impact of a constitutionally\n\ndeficient defense on a verdict turns primarily on the strength of the evidence\n\nagainst the defendant and how counsel's errors relate to that evidence. If the\n\nState has a strong case against the defendant, or if counsel's error touches only\n\nslightly on the facts central to the State's case, counsel's performance, unless\n\negregiously lacking, will not result in a different outcome. Savage, 120 N.J. at\n\n616; Pierre, 223 N.J. at 583 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 696) (\"[A] verdict\n\nor conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been\n\naffected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\").\n\n\n\n\nboth as officers of the court and as loyal and zealous advocates for their clients.\"\nCriminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function \u00a7 4-1.2(b) (Am. Bar Ass'n\n2015); see also Martin v. Rose, 744 F.2d 1245, 1249 (6th Cir. 1984) (\"[E]ven\ndeliberate trial tactics may constitute ineffective assistance if they fall outside\nthe wide range of professionally competent assistance.\").\n                                                                            A-1073-17T1\n                                         9\n\f      Conversely, in the face of weak incriminating evidence, counsel's\n\nmistakes, especially if they bear directly on that evidence, will likely affect the\n\noutcome. See Pierre, 223 N.J. at 584-88 (finding defense counsel's failure to\n\ncall alibi witnesses prejudiced the verdict because the State had only \"belated\n\nand uncertain identification\" evidence and only a speculative rebuttal to the\n\nalibi). But counsel's errors do not result in prejudice simply because they had\n\n\"some conceivable effect on the proceeding's outcome.\" State v. Arthur, 184\n\nN.J. 307, 319 (2005) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693). \"Some errors will\n\nhave had a pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence,\n\naltering the entire evidentiary picture, and some will have had an isolated, trivial\n\neffect.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695-96.\n\n      Applying these principles, we do not find a reasonable probability that ,\n\nbut for counsel's conduct, the jury would have returned a different verdict. The\n\nState's case against defendant was strong.        At the show-ups, the victims\n\nindependently identified defendant as the man who wielded the knife. They\n\ntestified that defendant asked them if they were in a gang and demanded their\n\nmoney. One victim testified that defendant cut him. Another witness testified\n\nthat defendant slashed at him.       The victims' testimony was supported by\n\npowerful circumstantial evidence, including the police's seizure of the knife,\n\n\n                                                                            A-1073-17T1\n                                        10\n\fbaseball bat, and the victims' caps in the apartment building to which defendant\n\nand his cohorts fled.\n\n      We recognize the prejudicial effect of evidence tying a defendant to gang\n\nmembership. See State v. Herbert, ___ N.J. Super. ___, ___ (App. Div. 2019)\n\n(slip op. at 23-25). Nonetheless, gang-related evidence may be admitted to\n\nprove motive under N.J.R.E. 404(b), so long as it is accompanied by an\n\nappropriate limiting instruction. State v. Goodman, 415 N.J. Super. 210, 227-\n\n28 (App. Div. 2010). As the PCR court noted, the trial court in this case properly\n\ninstructed the jury that the evidence regarding gang membership, if credited at\n\nall, had relevance only to the issue of motive and intent \u2013 in other words, whether\n\ndefendant and others confronted the victims to address a gang-related matter and\n\nnot to commit a theft. The court expressly instructed the jury that it could not\n\nuse the gang-related evidence to conclude defendant was a bad person or was\n\nmore likely to have committed the crime.\n\n      In sum, defendant has not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that,\n\nhad defendant's counsel not elicited evidence that defendant was a gang-member\n\nacting in concert with others, there was a reasonable probability the result of the\n\ntrial would have been different.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                           A-1073-17T1\n                                       11\n\f",
