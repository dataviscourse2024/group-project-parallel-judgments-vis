Vanaskie\n\n          Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                      October 26, 2007\n\n\nBefore: SLOVITER, CHAGARES, and HARDIMAN, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n                  (Filed: November 8, 2007)\n\n\n                    __________________\n\n                 OPINION OF THE COURT\n                   __________________\n\fCHAGARES, Circuit Judge.\n\n       Plaintiff appellant Dr. Michael F. Gleeson appeals the District Court\u2019s\n\ndecision dismissing his unlawful search and seizure and related civil conspiracy\n\nclaims as time-barred. The District Court granted defendant assistant district\n\nattorney John C. Prevoznik\u2019s motion in limine, challenging the timeliness of\n\nGleeson\u2019s claims, and denied Gleeson\u2019s motion to strike the limitations defense.\n\nIn this appeal, Gleeson argues that Prevoznik\u2019s assertion of the affirmative defense\n\nof statute of limitations was untimely, and the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d tolled any statute of\n\nlimitations defense. We disagree and will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.\n\n                                          I.\n\n       As we write only for the parties, we do not set out the facts in great detail.\n\nBeginning in 1999, Gleeson, a medical doctor licensed to practice in Pennsylvania,\n\nstarted performing trans-umbilical breast augmentation surgery, which he\n\nadvertised in newspapers in Monroe and Lackawanna counties. Gleeson consulted\n\nwith Dr. Robert Grafton, a board certified medical doctor licensed in Michigan but\n\nnot Pennsylvania, regarding the surgeries, and paid Grafton for his assistance. In\n\nMay 1999, a local Pennsylvania television station filmed portions of the surgery\n\nthat Dr. Gleeson and Dr. Grafton performed on a patient.\n\n       Detective Michael Robson of the Pocono Mountain Regional Police\n\nDepartment investigated whether the law had been violated, and Prevoznik was\n\nassigned as the assistant district attorney. In November 2000, Robson obtained\n\n                                          2\n\fsearch warrants for Gleeson\u2019s three medical offices. Robson served as the affiant\n\nfor the Affidavits of Probable Cause and other paperwork for the warrants, and\n\nPrevoznik assisted with drafting the language for the warrants.\n\n       In spring 2001, Robson and Prevoznik drafted a criminal complaint and\n\naffidavit of probable cause, which Detective Robson submitted to a district justice,\n\nwho issued an arrest warrant for Gleeson. The criminal complaint contained over\n\n400 charges, including unauthorized practice of medicine and surgery, theft by\n\ndeception, and deceptive or fraudulent business practices.\n\n       The Commonwealth withdrew the charges against Gleeson in August 2001.\n\nGleeson filed an action against Detective Robson and others on October 1, 2002,\n\nasserting, inter alia, unlawful search and seizure and malicious prosecution. The\n\ncomplaint did not, however, name Prevoznik as a defendant.\n\n       On April 1, 2003, Gleeson brought this action against Prevoznik, asserting\n\nthat he had acted with Robson to acquire the search warrants and file criminal\n\ncharges. Prevoznik filed a motion to dismiss on May 29, 2003, arguing that the\n\naction was barred either by qualified immunity or absolute immunity. The motion\n\ndid not challenge the timeliness of Gleeson\u2019s claims.\n\n       In July 2003, the District Court conducted a case management conference\n\nand directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on the immunity issues raised in\n\nthe motion to dismiss. The District Court allowed discovery to proceed while the\n\nmotion to dismiss was pending. Prevoznik was a witness in the first action that\n\n                                          3\n\fGleeson had filed against Robson and others, and the claims in the case against\n\nPrevoznik were similar to the claims in the case against Robson.\n\n       Gleeson moved for partial summary judgment in February 2004, arguing\n\nthat there was no probable cause for the charges filed against him. In March 2004,\n\nPrevoznik moved for summary judgment, even though the motion to dismiss was\n\nstill pending, reasserting the immunity defenses and claiming that as a matter of\n\nlaw there was probable cause for the charges.\n\n       On May 6, 2005, the District Court issued an opinion addressing the\n\nsummary judgment motions in this case and in the case against Robson. The\n\nDistrict Court granted Prevoznik summary judgment with respect to Gleeson\u2019s\n\ncivil rights malicious prosecution and intentional tort claims. The District Court\n\ndid not, however, grant Prevoznik summary judgment with respect to Gleeson\u2019s\n\nunlawful search claim, finding a genuine issue of material fact as to the defense of\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n       After ruling on the immunity issues in the summary judgment context, the\n\nDistrict Court dismissed Prevoznik\u2019s motion to dismiss as moot. Prevoznik was\n\nthen required, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to file an answer to the\n\ncomplaint by May 20, 2005, ten business days from the time the motion was\n\ndismissed. On May 19, 2005, the day before the answer to the complaint was due,\n\nPrevoznik filed an appeal, and Gleeson cross-appealed. The litigation in the\n\nDistrict Court was stayed pending the outcome of the appeals.\n\n                                         4\n\f       On July 24, 2006, this Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s May 6, 2005\n\ndecision, and on August 21, 2006 the District Court issued an order setting a trial\n\ndate of November 6, 2006, for both this action and the action against Robson. The\n\nDistrict Court directed the parties to file motions in limine by September 22, 2006.\n\n       Prevoznik filed his answer to the complaint on September 6, 2006, raising\n\nthe bar of the statute of limitations, among other issues. In the answer, Prevoznik\n\nnoted that any remaining claims against him related to matters that had occurred\n\non or before November 15, 2000, and the two-year statute of limitations expired on\n\nthose claims before this action was brought on April 1, 2003. Prevoznik then filed\n\na motion in limine on September 22, 2006, in which he again raised the bar of the\n\nstatute of limitations and requested an order \u201cprecluding introduction of any\n\nevidence for acts prior to April 2001.\u201d Appendix (App.) 141. Prevoznik argued\n\nthat by filing suit on April 1, 2003, Gleeson only preserved claims relating to the\n\nperiod after April 1, 2001. Because the alleged unlawful searches occurred in\n\nNovember 2000, Prevoznik concluded that \u201c[n]o claims may properly be stated\n\nagainst Prevoznik for acts he took in preparing documents to obtain search\n\nwarrants for the search of Gleeson\u2019s medical offices.\u201d App. 142.\n\n       On September 26, 2006, Gleeson moved to strike the statute of limitations\n\ndefense on the ground that Prevoznik had waived the defense by failing to raise it\n\nin either his motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment. Gleeson argued\n\nin the alternative that he could not have known about Prevoznik\u2019s involvement in\n\n                                          5\n\fthe case at the time his offices were searched. On November 2, 2006, the District\n\nCourt denied Gleeson\u2019s motion and granted Prevoznik\u2019s, dismissing the remaining\n\nclaims against Prevoznik. This appeal followed.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s final order pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The District Court had jurisdiction over the case pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343 and 1367. We have plenary review\n\nwhere an appeal \u201cinvolves the selection, interpretation, and application of legal\n\nprecepts.\u201d Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Franklin, 993 F.2d 349, 352 (3d Cir.\n\n1993) (quotation marks omitted); see also Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 419\n\n(3d Cir. 2000) (explaining in the context of a habeas petition that we have plenary\n\nreview when a case is dismissed as time-barred). The District Court\u2019s\n\n\u201cinterpretation of applicable tolling principles and its conclusion that the facts\n\nprevented a tolling of the statute of limitations\u201d are also subject to plenary review.\n\nLake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 365 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a defendant\n\nplead an affirmative defense, such as a statute of limitations defense, in his answer\n\nto the complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c). The reason\n\nfor this requirement is \u201cto avoid surprise and undue prejudice by providing the\n\nplaintiff with notice and the opportunity to demonstrate why the affirmative\n\ndefense should not succeed.\u201d Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 134 (3d Cir.\n\n                                           6\n\f2002). This Court, however, also allows the statute of limitations defense to be\n\nraised in a motion to dismiss, \u201cif the time alleged in the statement of a claim shows\n\nthat the cause of action has not been brought within the statute of limitations.\u201d Id.\n\nat 135 (quotations marks omitted). Affirmative defenses, including a statute of\n\nlimitations defense, must generally be raised \u201cas early as reasonably possible.\u201d Id.\n\nat 135-36.\n\n                                         III.\n\n       Gleeson argues that Prevoznik waived his statute of limitations defense by\n\nfailing to raise it in either his motion to dismiss or his motion for summary\n\njudgment. Gleeson contends that because Prevoznik raised his statute of\n\nlimitations defense two months before trial and three and a half years after the\n\ncomplaint was filed against him, his actions were \u201centirely inconsistent with the\n\npurpose of Rule 8(c) which requires all affirmative defenses to be raised as early as\n\npracticable so as to avoid prejudice and promote judicial economy.\u201d Appellant Br.\n\nat 14. According to Gleeson, Prevoznik \u201cwasted precious legal and judicial\n\nresources,\u201d given that the parties had completed discovery and argued summary\n\njudgment motions and interlocutory appeals. Id. at 15.\n\n       Yet, as the District Court correctly explained, \u201cPrevoznik asserted the\n\nlimitations defense in his initial responsive pleading to the Complaint. That the\n\ninitial responsive pleading was not due until August 29, 2006 is not the fault of\n\nPrevoznik.\u201d App. 12. The complicated procedural posture of this case, and the\n\n                                          7\n\fvarious interlocutory appeals and related proceedings, resulted in this unusual\n\ntiming.\n\n       Prevoznik was not required to file the answer until ten days after the\n\nDistrict Court decided his motion to dismiss on May 6, 2005. When Prevoznik\n\nfiled an appeal on May 19, 2005, one day before the answer was due, the\n\nrequirement that he file an answer was suspended. Timely filing of a notice of\n\nappeal conferred jurisdiction on this Court and divested the District Court of\n\ncontrol of the case. Venen v. Sweet, 758 F.2d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 1985). This Court\n\nmaintained jurisdiction until the mandate was issued on August 15, 2006. See\n\nUnited States v. Jerry, 487 F.2d 600, 607 (3d Cir. 1973). The District Court\n\nconcluded that the ten-day period for filing an answer started anew on the date of\n\nthe mandate and determined that the answer to the complaint was therefore due on\n\nAugust 29, 2006. Although Prevoznik did not file his answer until September 6,\n\n2006, eight days later, we hold that the District Court correctly determined that the\n\ndelay did not compel a finding of waiver. See Eddy v. V.I. Water & Power Auth.,\n\n256 F.3d 204, 209 (3d Cir. 2001) (noting that failure to assert an affirmative\n\ndefense in an appropriate responsive pleading does not automatically result in a\n\nwaiver).\n\n       In addition, as the District Court correctly noted, Gleeson cannot show that\n\nhe suffered prejudice because Prevoznik did not raise the limitations defense until\n\nthe filing of the answer. Gleeson did not spend significant additional resources as\n\n                                          8\n\fdiscovery in this case was related to discovery in the other ongoing action against\n\nRobson. Moreover, the record does not support a finding that Prevoznik delayed\n\nasserting the limitations defense for tactical reasons or acted in bad faith. Finally,\n\nalthough Prevoznik filed his answer eight days late, Gleeson did not suffer\n\nprejudice from this delay. We therefore conclude that the defense was not waived.\n\nSee Long v. Wilson, 393 F.3d 390, 396-401 (3d Cir. 2004) (holding that the\n\nCommonwealth did not waive the statute of limitations defense by failing to raise\n\nit in its answer to a habeas petition and allowing the Commonwealth to raise the\n\ndefense in a supplemental pleading 14 months after the petition was filed where\n\ndelay did not cause prejudice).\n\n                                         IV.\n\n       In the alternative, Gleeson argues that his claims against Prevoznik were, in\n\nfact, timely because the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d tolls any statute of limitations defense.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d the statute of limitations is tolled until the\n\ninjured party \u201cknows, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have\n\nknown, (1) that he has been injured, and (2) that his injury has been caused by\n\nanother\u2019s conduct.\u201d Haines v. Jones, 830 A.2d 579, 585 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003)\n\n(quotation marks omitted); see also O\u2019Brien v. Eli Lilly & Co., 668 F.2d 704, 711\n\n(3d Cir. 1981). Gleeson does not dispute that the cause of action for the alleged\n\nunlawful search of Gleeson\u2019s medical offices accrued when the searches were\n\nconducted on November 15, 2000 and that a two-year statute of limitations applies\n\n                                           9\n\f   to the unlawful search claims. Lake, 232 F.3d at 368-69. Rather, he contends that\n\n   the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d exception to the two year statute of limitations should apply\n\n   because he did not learn of Prevoznik\u2019s involvement in the alleged unlawful\n\n   searches and accompanying paperwork until Robson\u2019s deposition on March 24,\n\n   2003, and he filed a complaint against Prevoznik one week later.\n\n           This argument is unpersuasive. The \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d does not apply\n\n   where, as here, plaintiff could reasonably have discovered Prevoznik\u2019s identity and\n\n   named him in the complaint. The \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d requires that a plaintiff\n\n   \u201cexercise a reasonable amount of diligence and vigilance when pursuing a claim.\u201d\n\n   Id. at 367. In addition, we have previously explained that \u201c[t]here are very few\n\n   facts which diligence cannot discover, but there must be some reason to awaken\n\n   inquiry and direct diligence in the channel in which it would be successful. This is\n\n   what is meant by reasonable diligence.\u201d Vernau v. Vic\u2019s Mkt., Inc., 896 F.2d 43,\n\n   46 (3d Cir. 1990). As Prevoznik notes, Gleeson knew both of the injury and its\n\n   cause at the time it accrued, and if he had been reasonably diligent, he could have\n\n   identified the defendant or listed additional \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants, while\n\n   engaging in further discovery.1\n\n\n\n       1\n        The District Court concluded that the discovery rule did not toll the limitations\nperiod because Gleeson\u2019s counsel at the final pre-trial conference \u201cconceded that, unless\nwaived, the statute of limitations defense bars recovery against Prevoznik with respect to\nthe unlawful search and related conspiracy claims.\u201d App. 9. Given our determination\nthat Gleeson\u2019s attempt to invoke the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d is without merit, we need not\naddress this conclusion.\n                                            10\n\f                                         V.\n\n       For all of the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision\n\nin all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f",
