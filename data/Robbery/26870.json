Defendant was sentenced, as a third habitual offender, MCL 769.11, to 35 to 60\nyears\u2019 imprisonment for the armed robbery conviction, 35 to 60 years\u2019 imprisonment for the\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery conviction, 35 to 60 years\u2019 imprisonment for the carjacking\nconviction, and 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for the felony-firearm conviction. On appeal,\ndefendant argues that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for violations\nof the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), MCL 780.601, and that the trial court erred in\nits assessment of points for OVs 8, 14, and 19. We affirm.\n\n                                 I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        This case arises out of the armed robbery of the Dollar General in Ash Township,\nMichigan, on December 23, 2016. At approximately 10:55 p.m., defendant entered the store\nwith his face covered. At the time, the victim, AF, was working as an employee at the store, and\ndefendant\u2019s cousin, Dontai Renfroe,1 was the store\u2019s assistant manager. Defendant pointed a gun\n\n\n\n1\n  Renfroe initially pleaded guilty to armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and\ncarjacking, in relation to his involvement with the robbery of the Dollar General. However,\n\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\fin AF\u2019s face and told her to give him the money from the safe, which contained approximately\n$15,000. Defendant took AF to the front of the store to lock the front door. Defendant also\ndemanded AF\u2019s and Renfroe\u2019s telephones and keys. He took AF to the back office so that she\ncould retrieve her telephone and keys. Defendant ordered AF to open the store\u2019s safe, which was\nalso in the back of the store, and he became angry when AF was unable to do so. Renfroe\nopened the time release portion of the store\u2019s safe. Defendant stole approximately $7,500 from\nthe safe, as well as AF\u2019s telephone2 and personal keys, and the store\u2019s cordless telephone.\nDefendant ordered AF to return to the back room until defendant had left, threatening to shoot\nher if she did not comply. Defendant drove AF\u2019s van from the store. Responding police officers\nfound Renfroe\u2019s demeanor and conduct upon their arrival and in the security camera footage to\nbe suspicious. Defendant was identified as a suspect based on analyzing Renfroe\u2019s telephone.\n\n        Defendant was arrested on January 5, 2018, at his residence in Toledo. Because he was\non parole at the time, he was incarcerated in Ohio. On June 8, 2017, the Monroe County\nProsecutor received defendant\u2019s request for a final disposition. Defendant\u2019s trial date was set for\nFebruary 5, 2018, which was 243 days after the prosecutor\u2019s receipt of defendant\u2019s request for a\nfinal disposition. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of a violation of the IAD.\nDefendant argued that the prosecution violated the IAD because defendant\u2019s trial was not within\n180 days of the prosecution\u2019s receipt of defendant\u2019s request. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss because there was good cause for the adjournments that required the trial to be\nscheduled more than 180 days after the prosecution received defendant\u2019s request. Defendant was\nfound guilty by a jury as described above, and defendant does not substantively appeal his\nconvictions.3\n\n                                    II. MOTION TO DISMISS\n\n       Defendant argues that the trial court erred in determining that five periods of delay were\nexcluded from the IAD\u2019s 180-day limit. Consequently, he concludes that his charges should\nhave been dismissed. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\ndefendant\u2019s plea agreement was set aside, and defendant was resentenced on March 22, 2018, to\n15 to 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. Renfroe filed a delayed application for leave to appeal with this\nCourt, which was denied. People v Renfroe, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered\nDecember 21, 2018 (Docket No. 346374). Renfroe filed an application for leave to appeal with\nour Supreme Court, which was denied. People v Renfroe, ___ Mich ___; 929 NW2d 360 (2019).\n2\n    Defendant took AF\u2019s telephone and the store\u2019s telephone but did not take Renfroe\u2019s telephone.\n3\n  Defendant moved to remand on the basis of an alleged recantation by Renfroe. This Court\ndenied that motion without prejudice. People v Miller, unpublished order of the Court of\nAppeals, entered September 6, 2019 (Docket No. 343756). We note that Renfroe did not testify\nin this matter and the reason his plea agreement was set aside, see footnote 1, was his refusal to\ntestify pursuant to that agreement at defendant\u2019s preliminary examination. Defendant has not\nfurther pursued this theory.\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\f        This Court reviews for an abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s determination on a motion to\ndismiss. People v Stone, 269 Mich. App. 240, 242; 712 NW2d 165 (2005). A trial court abuses\nits discretion when its decision falls outside the range of principled outcomes. People v\nNicholson, 297 Mich. App. 191, 196; 822 NW2d 284 (2012). A trial court\u2019s attribution for a\ndelay is reviewed for clear error. Stone, 269 Mich. App. at 242. \u201cClear error exists if the\nreviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d People\nv Miller, 482 Mich. 540, 544; 759 NW2d 850 (2008). Questions of statutory interpretation are\nreviewed de novo. People v Gardner, 482 Mich. 41, 46; 753 NW2d 78 (2008).\n\n       \u201cThe IAD is a uniform law which prescribes procedures by which a prisoner may demand\nthe prompt disposition of charges pending against him in a state other than the one in which he is\nimprisoned and prescribes procedures by which a state may obtain, for trial, a prisoner who is\nincarcerated in another state.\u201d People v Malone, 177 Mich. App. 393, 396; 442 NW2d 658\n(1989). When a defendant \u201caffirmatively request[s] final disposition,\u201d id., Article III of the IAD\nprovides, in pertinent part:\n\n       [H]e shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have\n       caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the\n       prosecuting officers\u2019 jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment\n       and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or\n       complaint: Provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his\n       counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any\n       necessary or reasonable continuance. [MCL 780.601, art III(a).]\n\nIf a defendant is not brought to trial within 180 days, a trial court shall enter an order of dismissal\nwith prejudice. People v Swafford, 483 Mich. 1, 9; 762 NW2d 902 (2009), citing MCL 780.601,\nart V(c). However, \u201cthe IAD expressly permits\u2014and thus excludes from the 180\u2013day period\u2014\n\u2018necessary or reasonable continuance[s]\u2019 for \u2018good cause shown in open court . . . .\u2019 \u201d People v\nLown, 488 Mich. 242, 261 n 30; 794 NW2d 9 (2011), quoting MCL 780.601, art III(a). Thus,\ncertain delays may toll the 180-day period. As noted, defendant was brought to trial after 243\ndays, 63 days beyond the 180-day period.\n\n       The need for \u201cgood cause shown in open court\u201d applies \u201conly to adjournments and other\ndelays caused by the prosecution.\u201d People v Harris, 148 Mich. App. 506, 513; 384 NW2d 816\n(1986). Delays either caused by the defense, or to accommodate the defense, are necessarily\nconsidered tolling events. Stone, 269 Mich. App. at 243; Malone, 177 Mich. App. at 399.\nDefendant admits that 19 days of delay were due to his own requests and thus tolled the 180-day\nperiod. Thus, the discrepancy between the delay in bringing defendant to trial and the delay\npermitted by the IAD is reduced to 44 days.\n\n        An additional 31 days of delay occurred because Renfroe unexpectedly refused, from the\nwitness stand, to testify at defendant\u2019s preliminary examination, in violation of his then-existing\nplea agreement. Defendant and the prosecution were both uncertain, at the time, whether\nRenfroe\u2019s plea agreement was enforceable. When the trial court refused to make an immediate\nruling on that question, it appears that both parties requested an opportunity to consider and brief\nthe implications of Renfroe\u2019s refusal. We have difficulty attributing this delay to any particular\nparty. However, Renfroe\u2019s refusal was clearly a surprise to everyone present. Indeed, it appears\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fthat Renfoe made the decision to discontinue testifying while on the stand, and he maintained\nthat refusal despite being informed by the court and attorneys that he would lose his plea\nagreement if he did not testify. It is entirely reasonable that neither the parties nor the trial court\nwere prepared for the ramifications, and defendant agreed to the adjournment. We therefore\nconsider the delay occasioned by \u201cgood cause shown in open court.\u201d Consequently, this 31-day\ndelay also tolled the 180-day period, reducing the discrepancy to 13 days.\n\n        The longest delay was 54 days caused by the trial judge\u2019s hospitalization due to an\nillness. Defendant concedes that \u201cthis delay may meet the requirement of \u2018good cause.\u2019 \u201d We\nagree, and we conclude that the judge\u2019s hospitalization certainly constitutes good cause shown.\nDefendant argues that it nevertheless does not toll the 180-day limit under the IAD because it\nwas not \u201cshown in open court.\u201d However, the concept of \u201copen court\u201d does not necessarily\nrequire proceedings recorded in \u201cthe transcripts of open-court proceedings.\u201d See Harris, 149\nMich. App. at 513. Rather, it is intended to preclude \u201cadjournments granted ex parte to the\nprosecutor.\u201d People v Waclawski, 286 Mich. App. 634, 662; 780 NW2d 321 (2009). It is\nsufficient if the defendant demonstrably has a meaningful opportunity to address the matter. Id.\nat 662-663. The trial court contacted the parties via telephone and requested that the preliminary\nexamination be adjourned because the trial judge was hospitalized due to illness. Defendant did\nnot object to the adjournment, made no request for an alternate judge, and agreed to the new\npreliminary examination date. The open court requirement was sufficiently satisfied.\nFurthermore, a defendant generally cannot assert that his own conduct constitutes error\nwarranting reversal. See People v Green, 228 Mich. App. 684, 691; 580 NW2d 444 (1998).\nThus, this 54-day delay also tolled the 180-day period.\n\n        Consequently, 104 days of delay were attributable to or for the benefit of the defense, or\nwere for good cause shown in open court. The total unexcused delay under the IAD was\ntherefore 139 days, well within the 180-day period. It is therefore unnecessary for us to address\nany of the other delays. Because the total delay period was within the IAD\u2019s 180-day limit, the\ntrial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\n                                   III. OFFENSE VARIABLES\n\n      Defendant argues that the trial court erred by assessing 15 points for OV 8, 10 points for\nOV 14, and 15 points for OV 19. We disagree.\n\n        \u201cUnder the sentencing guidelines, the circuit court\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed\nfor clear error and must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Whether the facts, as\nfound, are adequate to satisfy the scoring conditions prescribed by statute, i.e., the application of\nthe facts to the law, is a question of statutory interpretation, which an appellate court reviews de\nnovo.\u201d People v Hardy, 494 Mich. 430, 438; 835 NW2d 340 (2013).\n\n                                              A. OV 8\n\n       Defendant argues that the trial court erred in assessing 15 points for OV 8 because\ndefendant did not move AF to an area of greater danger. We disagree.\n\n       Under OV 8, 15 points must be assessed when \u201c[a] victim was asported to another place\nof greater danger or to a situation of greater danger or was held captive beyond the time\n                                                 -4-\n\fnecessary to commit the offense.\u201d MCL 777.38(1)(a). \u201cUnder the plain meaning of the term\n\u2018asportation,\u2019 movement of a victim that is incidental to the commission of a crime nonetheless\nqualifies as asportation.\u201d People v Barrera, 500 Mich. 14, 17; 892 NW2d 789 (2017).\n\n       In determining that 15 points was appropriate for OV 8, the trial court stated:\n\n       Number one, I agree, and the Court sat through the trial here, and the Court saw\n       the actual video of what took place here. This victim was taken into an office, a\n       place that was more secrete [sic], that had less visibility, publicly speaking, or\n       anybody else to see the victim.\n\n               So, frankly, the Court does find that she was taken to a place of greater\n       danger. And with everything that went on, the length of time in this occurrence,\n       the places that she was traipsed throughout the store, it definitely was for a longer\n       amount of time than was necessary to commit the offense of Robbery Armed\n       here, when you walk right into the place and there are the cash register or things\n       like that.\n\n       The trial court did not err when it assessed 15 points for OV 8. Defendant led AF about\nthe Dollar General, from the cash registers to the front door to the back room. Defendant took\nAF to the back room, away from the windows and the front door, where witnesses might be able\nto see the armed robbery. \u201cA place of greater danger includes an isolated location where\ncriminal activities might avoid detection.\u201d People v Dillard, 303 Mich. App. 372, 379; 845\nNW2d 518 (2013), overruled in part on other grounds by Barrera, 500 Mich. at 17. The back\nroom of the Dollar General was an isolated location where the robbery would be less likely to be\ndiscovered. Therefore, there was a preponderance of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s\nassessment of 15 points.\n\n                                            B. OV 14\n\n      Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it assessed 10 points for OV 14 because\nRenfroe was the leader of the armed robbery. We disagree.\n\n        Ten points must be assessed for OV 14 when \u201c[t]he offender was a leader in a multiple\noffender situation.\u201d MCL 777.44(1)(a). When two offenders are involved in a criminal\ntransaction, only one individual may be considered a leader. People v Rhodes (On Remand), 305\nMich. App. 85, 88; 849 NW2d 417 (2014). \u201c[A] \u2018leader\u2019 is defined in relevant part as a person or\nthing that leads or a guiding or directing head, as of an army or political group. To \u2018lead\u2019 is\ndefined in relevant part as, in general, guiding, preceding, showing the way, directing, or\nconducting.\u201d Id. at 90 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n        Here, defendant was the only individual with a gun during the armed robbery, which is\nsome evidence of leadership. Rhodes, 305 Mich. App. at 90 (\u201c[D]efendant\u2019s exclusive possession\nof a gun during the criminal transaction is some evidence of leadership . . . \u201d) (emphasis in\noriginal). Defendant took an active role during the robbery to steal the money and telephones,\nwhereas Renfroe was submissive to defendant\u2019s orders. Additionally, defendant was the\nindividual with sole possession of the stolen money and the victim\u2019s and store\u2019s telephones.\nDetective Preadmore\u2019s statement in the presentence investigation report (PSIR) that defendant\n                                                -5-\n\fcontacted Renfroe to initiate the armed robbery also indicates that defendant was the leader of\nthe armed robbery. Additionally, defendant sent Renfroe a text message the night of the robbery\nstating, \u201c1055 I\u2019m threw dere taken yo phone hers n store n her car.\u201d The text message indicates\nthat defendant developed a plan to take all the telephones from the store during the robbery.\nTherefore, there was a preponderance of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s assessment of\n10 points for OV 14.\n\n                                            C. OV 19\n\n       Defendant argues that the trial court erred in assessing 15 points for OV 19 because there\nwas not a preponderance of the evidence to suggest that defendant intended to interfere with the\nrendering of emergency services when he stole AF\u2019s and Dollar General\u2019s telephones. We\ndisagree.\n\n        \u201cOV 19 is generally scored for conduct that constitutes an attempt to avoid being caught\nand held accountable for the sentencing offense.\u201d People v Sours, 315 Mich. App. 346, 349; 890\nNW2d 401 (2016). An assessment of 15 points is appropriate when \u201c[t]he offender used force or\nthe threat of force against another person or the property of another person to interfere with,\nattempt to interfere with, or that results in the interference with the administration of justice or\nthe rendering of emergency services.\u201d MCL 777.49(b).\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court speculated that the reason defendant stole the\ntelephones was to interfere with the administration of justice or the rendering of emergency\nservices. Defendant asserts that it was more reasonable that defendant stole the telephones for\ntheir value. We note that the store\u2019s telephone was a cordless handset, not a cellular telephone,\nand thus had questionable value on its own. Nevertheless, although defendant\u2019s theory is not\nimpossible, the trial court reasonably inferred that defendant stole the telephones to prevent AF\nfrom calling the police. \u201cThe trial court may rely on reasonable inferences arising from the\nrecord evidence to sustain the scoring of an offense variable.\u201d People v Earl, 297 Mich. App.\n104, 109; 822 NW2d 271 (2012), aff\u2019d 495 Mich. 33 (2014). Additionally, defendant threatened\nto shoot AF if she did not stay in the back until defendant left. Threatening a victim constitutes\ninterference with the administration of justice. People v Hershey (On Remand), 303 Mich. App.\n330, 344; 844 NW2d 127 (2013). Because the trial court reasonably inferred that defendant stole\nAF\u2019s and Dollar General\u2019s telephones to interfere with the administration of justice, and because\ndefendant threatened AF, there was a preponderance of the evidence for the trial court to assess\n15 points for OV 19.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       The prosecution did not violate the IAD, so the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss. Additionally, the trial court properly assessed 15 points for OV 8, 10 points\nfor OV 14, and 15 points for OV 19.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n                                                             /s/ Amy Ronayne Krause\n                                                             /s/ Patrick M.
