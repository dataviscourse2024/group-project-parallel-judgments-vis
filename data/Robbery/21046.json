Kinkaid Jr., Presiding\n\n                                          August 30, 2013\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         Before CAMPBELL and HANCOCK and PIRTLE, JJ.\n\n\n          Appellant, Meshell Lynn Fox, was convicted of theft of property in an amount of\n\nless than $50 with two prior theft convictions alleged which elevated the theft case to a\n\nState Jail Felony offense.1           The same jury assessed appellant\u2019s punishment at\n\nconfinement in a state jail for a term of 540 days. Appellant appealed, and we will\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n          1\n              See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 31.03(e)(4)(D) (West Supp. 2012).\n\f       Appellant=s attorney has filed an Anders brief and a motion to withdraw. Anders\n\nv. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1967). In support of his\n\nmotion to withdraw, counsel certifies that he has diligently reviewed the record, and in\n\nhis opinion, the record reflects no reversible error upon which an appeal can be\n\npredicated. Id. at 744\u201345. In compliance with High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 813\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1978), counsel has candidly discussed why, under the controlling\n\nauthorities, there is no error in the trial court=s judgment. Additionally, counsel has\n\ncertified that he has provided appellant a copy of the Anders brief and motion to\n\nwithdraw and appropriately advised appellant of her right to file a pro se response in this\n\nmatter. Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503, 510 (Tex.Crim.App. 1991). The Court has\n\nalso advised appellant of her right to file a pro se response. Appellant has not filed a\n\nresponse.\n\n\n       By his Anders brief, counsel raises grounds that could possibly support an\n\nappeal, but concludes the appeal is frivolous. We have reviewed these grounds and\n\nmade an independent review of the entire record to determine whether there are any\n\narguable grounds which might support an appeal. See Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75,\n\n109 S. Ct. 346, 102 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1988); Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 2005).     We have found no such arguable grounds and agree with\n\ncounsel that the appeal is frivolous.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f       Accordingly, counsel=s motion to withdraw is hereby granted, and the trial court=s\n\njudgment is affirmed. 2\n\n\n\n\n                                                Mackey K. Hancock\n                                                    Justice\n\n\nDo not publish.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        Counsel shall, within five days after this opinion is handed down, send his client\na copy of the opinion and judgment, along with notification of appellant=s right to file a\npro se petition for discretionary review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 48.4.\n\n\n                                            3\n\f",
