FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n  Defendants John Ligon and Carroll Mizell appeal their fel-\nony convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 for theft of govern-\nment property. They contend, inter alia, that the government\ndid not prove that the property had a \u201cvalue\u201d within the mean-\ning of \u00a7 641. We agree and reverse the convictions.\n\n                    I. Factual Background\n\n   The United States Forest Service (\u201cUSFS\u201d) posted a reward\nfor information concerning the theft of several Native Ameri-\ncan petroglyphs that had been removed from an unmarked site\non the side of a mountain in northwest Reno. Acting on a tip\nreceived under a \u201csecret witness\u201d program, Reno police found\ntwo of the petroglyphs prominently displayed in the front yard\nof Ligon\u2019s home, and a third in the back of his Suburban vehi-\ncle parked at his home.\n\n   USFS special agents then interviewed Ligon and Mizell.\nLigon explained that he drove out to the mountainside and\nused a winch and a roller device to pull the three \u201crocks\u201d out.\nHe admitted that he never sought permission or advice before\ntaking the rocks, and that he excavated them after dark. He\nclaimed that he took the rocks in order to protect them from\nbeing \u201cbowled over\u201d by an encroaching construction develop-\nment, and to display them in his front yard. Mizell stated that\nhe went to the mountainside with Ligon, and he corroborated\nthat the winch and roller device had been used to extract the\npetroglyphs and move them to Ligon\u2019s yard. A USFS special\nagent found a pry bar on the mountainside near where the pet-\nroglyphs had been, but neither Ligon nor Mizell mentioned\nusing this tool.\n\n   A grand jury indicted Ligon and Mizell for removing\narchaeological resources in violation of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470ee\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. LIGON                  2993\n(Count I), and stealing United States government property in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (Count II). Count I charged that\neach defendant \u201cdid knowingly excavate, remove, damage\nand otherwise alter and deface archaeological resources\nlocated on public lands . . . without having a permit to do so,\nand commercial and archaeological value and the cost of res-\ntoration and repair of said resources exceed[ed] the sum of\n$500.\u201d Count II charged that the defendants \u201cdid willfully and\nknowingly steal . . . three petroglyph rocks . . . having a value\nin excess of $1,000, and which was then and there the prop-\nerty of the United States[.]\u201d The jury acquitted Ligon and\nMizell of Count I, but found them both guilty of knowingly\nstealing property valued at more than $1,000 under Count II.\n\n   Before trial, a USFS archaeologist prepared a report that\nincluded an estimate of \u201ccommercial or fair market value\u201d by\nMark Bahti, the owner of \u201cBahti Indian Arts,\u201d a commercial\nart gallery in Tucson, Arizona. Bahti\u2019s report was based on\nphotographs of the petroglyphs. Noting that they had been\n\u201cbadly scarred in the removal process,\u201d Bahti estimated their\nretail value at $800 or $900. He \u201cconservatively\u201d estimated\nthat they could be sold for $1,500 if they were in good condi-\ntion.\n\n   The government did not introduce Bahti\u2019s report at trial. In\nfact, the government introduced no evidence at all of market\nor other monetary value of the petroglyphs. For both Counts\nI and II, it relied only on \u201carchaeological value,\u201d a valuation\nconcept that considers the worth of archaeological informa-\ntion. A USFS archaeologist testified that the petroglyphs had\nan archaeological value in the $8,000 range, and a USFS spe-\ncial agent testified that she could not determine a \u201ccommer-\ncial value\u201d for the petroglyphs, even after contacting\nnumerous sources. The jury instruction on property value for\nCount II provided: \u201cOn the valuation issue as to Count Two,\nthe government relies on archaeological value.\u201d\n\n  At the close of evidence, the defendants moved for judg-\nments of acquittal on Count II under Federal Rule of Criminal\n\f2994                UNITED STATES v. LIGON\nProcedure 29(a) on the ground that the government had intro-\nduced no evidence of value within the meaning of \u00a7 641. The\ndistrict court took the motions under advisement and submit-\nted the cases to the jury. After the jury returned verdicts of\nguilty on Count II, defendants renewed their motions for\nacquittal, now as Rule 29(c) motions. Defendants attached\ncopies of Bahti\u2019s report to their renewed motions. The district\ncourt denied the motions.\n\n                        II. Discussion\n\n   [1] Section 641 criminalizes the theft of a \u201cthing of value\nof the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. The statute provides\ntwo tiers of penalties depending on the value of the stolen\nproperty. If the value exceeds $1,000, the court can sentence\nthe defendant to a maximum of ten years in prison. Id. Since\nthis offense is \u201cpunishable\u201d by a term of imprisonment \u201cex-\nceeding one year,\u201d it constitutes a felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(1). If\nthe value is $1,000 or less, however, the maximum sentence\nis one year, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, which makes the offense a mis-\ndemeanor. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(2). Regardless of whether the gov-\nernment charges a felony or a misdemeanor, value is an\nelement of the offense, and the government must prove that\nthe property stolen had \u201cvalue.\u201d United States v. Seaman, 18\nF.3d 649, 650 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting that \u201cvalue\u201d is an ele-\nment of a \u00a7 641 offense).\n\n   [2] Section 641 defines \u201cvalue\u201d as \u201cface, par, or market\nvalue, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is\ngreater.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. The historical and statutory notes\nto \u00a7 641 indicate that the 1948 drafters adopted this definition\n\u201cto conform with that provided in section 2311 of this title.\u201d\nConstruing \u00a7 2311, we have found that \u201cwhere goods have no\nreadily ascertainable market value, \u2018any reasonable method\nmay be employed to ascribe an equivalent monetary value to\nthe items.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Drebin, 557 F.2d 1316, 1331\n(9th Cir. 1977) (quoting United States v. Lester, 282 F.2d 750,\n755 (3d Cir. 1960)). In a more recent \u00a7 641 case, we inter-\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. LIGON                    2995\npreted \u201cmarket value\u201d to include value in a so-called \u201cthieves\u2019\nmarket\u201d:\n\n    In the absence of face or par value, property value is\n    determined by market forces which establish the\n    price at which a buyer is willing to offer the property\n    to a willing seller. As there is no commercial market\n    for [the property in question in this case], however,\n    comparisons with similar transactions in a conven-\n    tional market do not exist to assess the value of this\n    particular sale. In such cases, the property\u2019s value in\n    an illegal market may be considered. This gives\n    \u00a7 641 its obvious, and certainly its practical, mean-\n    ing, namely, the amount the goods may bring to the\n    thief.\n\nUnited States v. Bigelow, 728 F.2d 412, 413-14 (9th Cir.\n1984) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   The government did not rely on the definition of \u201cvalue\u201d in\n\u00a7 641. Instead, it entirely relied on \u201carchaeological value,\u201d as\nthat term is used in 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 470ee(d) and 470ff(a)(2)(A),\nfor proof of value under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. The following col-\nloquy between the district court and the government during\nthe discussion of the defendants\u2019 Rule 29(a) motions makes\nthis clear:\n\n    The Court: Is there evidence in this case on the mar-\n    ket value?\n\n    Mr. Gifford [for the government]: No, Your Honor\n    ....\n\n    ...\n\n    Mr. Gifford: We only presented archaeological\n    value, Your Honor. And that\u2019s all we\u2019re \u2014\n\f2996               UNITED STATES v. LIGON\n    The Court: Okay. Is there anything here on par\n    value?\n\n    Mr. Rachow [for the government]: Your Honor,\n    there\u2019s no definition of par value.\n\n    The Court: Is there anything on face value?\n\n    Mr. Gifford: No, Your Honor.\n\n    The Court: Okay. So what you\u2019re relying on is the\n    archaeological value and asking that that be extrapo-\n    lated and used for purposes of Count Two in estab-\n    lishing the value, is that correct?\n\n    Mr. Gifford: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n   [3] Congress coined the term \u201carchaeological value\u201d when\nit passed the Archaeological Resources Protection Act\n(\u201cARPA\u201d) in 1979. ARPA protects \u201carchaeological resources\nand sites which are on public lands and Indian lands.\u201d 16\nU.S.C. \u00a7 470aa(b). Violators of ARPA are subject to penalties\nthat vary depending on the \u201ccommercial or archaeological\nvalue of the archaeological resources involved\u201d and the \u201ccost\nof restoration and repair.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 470ee(d), 470ff(a)(2).\n\n   [4] Regulations promulgated pursuant to ARPA define \u201car-\nchaeological value\u201d as the value of archaeological informa-\ntion rather than the value of archaeological artifacts. These\nregulations share the following definition:\n\n    Archaeological value. For the purposes of this part,\n    the archaeological value of any archaeological\n    resource . . . shall be the value of the information\n    associated with the archaeological resource. This\n    value shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the\n    retrieval of the scientific information which would\n    have been obtainable prior to the violation. These\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. LIGON                  2997\n    costs may include, but need not be limited to, the\n    cost of preparing a research design, conducting field\n    work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing\n    reports as would be necessary to realize the informa-\n    tion potential.\n\n18 C.F.R \u00a7 1312.14(a); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.14(a); 36 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 296.14(a); 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.14(a) (emphasis added). \u201cArchaeo-\nlogical value\u201d is based on an analysis that \u201cgo[es] back in\ntime before the violation occurred and estimate[s] what it\nwould have cost the United States to engage in a full-blown\narchaeological dig at the site\u201d in order to obtain the archaeo-\nlogical information. United States v. Quarrell, 310 F.3d 664,\n679 (10th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).\n\n   [5] \u201cArchaeological value,\u201d so defined, is not the equiva-\nlent of, nor is it encompassed by, \u201cface, par, or market value,\nor cost price, either wholesale or retail,\u201d as those terms are\nused to define \u201cvalue\u201d in \u00a7 641. Moreover, our case law is\nclear that acceptable alternative methods of calculating value\nunder \u00a7\u00a7 2311 and 641 are permissible only where market\nvalue is not readily ascertainable. See Bigelow, 728 F.2d at\n414; Drebin, 557 F.2d at 1331. Here, the government had evi-\ndence of the petroglyphs\u2019 market value but did not introduce\nthat evidence at trial.\n\n   We recognize that for theft offenses involving \u201carchaeolog-\nical resources,\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines impose an\nenhancement that is tied to \u201carchaeological value,\u201d irrespec-\ntive of whether the government obtains the conviction under\n\u00a7 641 or ARPA. See U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 638; U.S.S.G.\n\u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1(c)(4), 2B1.5(b)(1) & cmt. n.1(C), n.2(A)(i),\nn.2(C)(i). But the Sentencing Guidelines do not apply until\nthe government secures a conviction under a statute such as\n\u00a7 641 in accordance with the statutory terms.\n\n  The government\u2019s choice not to introduce any evidence of\n\u201cvalue\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 641 unfortunately leaves us\n\f2998                UNITED STATES v. LIGON\nlittle choice. It is clear that Ligon and Mizell stole the petro-\nglyphs. It is equally clear that the petroglyphs had a market\nvalue, as evidenced by Bahti\u2019s report. But the government did\nnot introduce that report into evidence, or indeed anything\nelse that might have served as evidence of \u201cvalue\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a7 641, although it obviously could have done so.\nWe therefore are constrained to reverse the district court\u2019s\ndenial of the defendants\u2019 Rule 29(c) motions.\n\n                          Conclusion\n\n   [6] \u201cArchaeological value,\u201d as that term is used in 16\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 470ee(d) and 470ff(a)(2)(A), and in the regulations\npromulgated thereunder, does not come within the definition\nof \u201cvalue\u201d as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. Because\nthe government introduced no evidence other than \u201carchaeo-\nlogical value\u201d to prove that Ligon and Mizell stole something\nof \u201cvalue\u201d belonging to the government in violation of \u00a7 641,\nthe district court should have granted their motions for acquit-\ntal.\n\n  REVERSED.\n\f",
