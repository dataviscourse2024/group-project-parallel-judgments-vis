Fathauer, of participation in\n       methamphetamine manufacturing (720 ILCS 646/15(a)(2)(A) (West 2010)) and obstruction of\n       justice (720 ILCS 5/31-4(a) (West 2010)). The trial court sentenced defendant to 20 years in\n       prison for the methamphetamine offense and a concurrent term of 3 years in prison for\n       obstruction. On direct appeal, this court affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence. People\n       v. Fathauer, 2013 IL App (4th) 120424-U, \u00b6 2.\n\u00b62         In February 2014, defendant pro se filed a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to the\n       Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) (725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (West 2014)). Defendant alleged\n       four grounds for relief, including ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In April 2014, the trial\n       court appointed counsel to represent defendant on his postconviction petition, and later that\n       month the State filed a motion to dismiss.\n\u00b63         In August 2015, postconviction counsel filed a motion to withdraw. Citing People v.\n       Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, 32 N.E.3d 655, postconviction counsel argued each of defendant\u2019s\n       pro se claims was in fact frivolous or patently without merit. In May 2016, the trial court\n       granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw over defendant\u2019s objection but did not address the\n       State\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\u00b64         Defendant appealed, and this court dismissed the appeal for want of a final order. People\n       v. Fathauer, 2017 IL App (4th) 160364-U, \u00b6 2. On remand, the trial court granted the State\u2019s\n       motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s postconviction petition.\n\u00b65         Defendant appeals, arguing the trial court erred by granting postconviction counsel\u2019s\n       motion to withdraw because (1) defendant\u2019s petition stated a claim for ineffective assistance\n       of counsel and (2) postconviction counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to amend\n       the pro se petition. We disagree and affirm.\n\n\u00b66                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b67                                        A. Procedural History\n\u00b68         In June 2010, the State charged defendant with participation in methamphetamine\n       manufacturing (720 ILCS 646/15(a)(2)(A) (West 2010)) and obstruction of justice (720 ILCS\n       5/31-4(a) (West 2010)). The State alleged defendant knowingly participated in the manufacture\n       of less than 15 grams of methamphetamine or a substance containing methamphetamine on\n       May 22, 2010. Regarding the obstruction charge, the State alleged defendant knowingly\n       concealed evidence by throwing a glass jar containing methamphetamine into a grassy area.\n\u00b69         In January 2012, the case proceeded to a jury trial. We need not provide a detailed summary\n       of the testimony at trial. Such a summary may be found in the direct appeal of defendant\u2019s\n       conviction. See Fathauer, 2013 IL App (4th) 120424-U. The resolution of defendant\u2019s appeal\n       largely turns on the testimony of one witness, Daron Trudeau.\n\n\u00b6 10                                         1. The Jury Trial\n\u00b6 11       The State\u2019s first witness was Jeffrey Leininger, a Springfield police officer. Leininger was\n       on duty around noon on May 22, 2010. Because a detective wanted to speak to Trudeau \u201cwith\n       reference to him parting out stolen parts on a stolen car,\u201d Leininger drove to Maaco (an auto\n       collision repair shop) to search for Trudeau and a Chevy Blazer. When he saw the Blazer,\n\n                                                    -2-\n\f       Leininger pulled his squad car next to it and asked the driver if they could talk. The driver\n       responded, \u201cWhy?\u201d and drove away. The driver continued even after Leininger exited his\n       squad car and told him to stop. Leininger followed the Blazer and initiated a traffic stop,\n       informing the driver, Trudeau, that he was under arrest \u201cfor basically obstruction, resisting, for\n       not listening to [his] commands, and driving away.\u201d Defendant was in the passenger seat. At\n       some point Leininger observed white spots on defendant\u2019s clothing. He asked Trudeau and\n       defendant if they had thrown anything from the window. Both denied having done so.\n\u00b6 12       Trudeau testified he and defendant had known each other for five to seven years. On May\n       21, 2010, Trudeau took some methamphetamine he had cooked the day before to defendant\u2019s\n       Decatur home. The methamphetamine needed further processing. To process the\n       methamphetamine, Trudeau used a \u201cgenerator\u201d (a glass jar with a hose connected to it) and\n       muriatic acid. Trudeau would mix aluminum with the muriatic acid to make smoke.\n       Methamphetamine would form at the bottom of the jar. At that point, the methamphetamine\n       would be wet. Trudeau would strain the product through coffee filters and let it dry. At\n       defendant\u2019s house, Trudeau asked for filters and used them. Once he had the final product,\n       Trudeau waited for it to dry and then took it with him.\n\u00b6 13       Trudeau testified he and defendant left defendant\u2019s home in Trudeau\u2019s Chevy Blazer.\n       While in the Blazer, Trudeau cooked more methamphetamine. Defendant assisted by acting as\n       a lookout and by steadying the generator. The two smoked some of the methamphetamine.\n       They also went to Trudeau\u2019s sister\u2019s house and then to Springfield. Defendant was with\n       Trudeau when Trudeau bought lighter fluid. Trudeau obtained the anhydrous ammonia earlier\n       by stealing it from tanks.\n\u00b6 14       According to Trudeau, he drove to Maaco to pick up his last check from work. As he exited\n       the Maaco parking lot, a police officer told Trudeau he wanted to talk. Trudeau responded he\n       had nothing to say and drove away. Trudeau testified he did not stop because he had\n       methamphetamine in his car. Trudeau handed defendant a mason jar, which contained\n       methamphetamine, and told defendant to throw it out. Defendant threw the jar and its contents\n       out of the passenger window. Trudeau stated a bag containing methamphetamine and a pipe\n       were also thrown from the window. Trudeau believed he disposed of those items. Trudeau then\n       stopped for the police. An officer removed Trudeau from the Blazer and handcuffed him.\n       Trudeau was arrested on May 22, 2010, for unlawful participation in methamphetamine\n       manufacturing.\n\u00b6 15       Trudeau further testified he was interviewed by the police and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.\n       He testified he was not promised anything for his testimony and that he was facing the same\n       charges as defendant.\n\u00b6 16       On cross-examination, Trudeau testified his trial for methamphetamine manufacturing was\n       approaching. Trudeau believed he would get probation for that offense because he had not been\n       in trouble before. Trudeau agreed he had not been caught stealing anhydrous ammonia. He\n       denied stealing anything else, including car parts. Trudeau testified he did not know he was\n       purchasing stolen parts. He bought them because they fit his vehicle. Trudeau was not arrested\n       for possessing stolen car parts.\n\u00b6 17       Trudeau acknowledged giving three interviews with police and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.\n       Trudeau did not think he had told police in his first interview that he knew the parts recovered\n       were stolen. Trudeau admitted he used half a gram to a gram of methamphetamine per day and\n       denied telling the police officers he used two to three grams per day. Trudeau stated he had\n\n                                                   -3-\n\f       been making methamphetamine for four to five months and admitted he sold\n       methamphetamine when he wanted money. All of the items in the truck were thrown out of\n       the passenger side window. He admitted that each time he manufactured methamphetamine he\n       had to steal anhydrous ammonia. Trudeau also recruited people to purchase pseudoephedrine\n       pills.\n\u00b6 18       The jury found defendant guilty of both charged offenses. The trial court sentenced\n       defendant to concurrent prison terms of 20 years for methamphetamine manufacturing and 3\n       years for obstruction.\n\n\u00b6 19                                     2. The Direct Appeal\n\u00b6 20      On direct appeal, this court summarized defendant\u2019s arguments as follows:\n                 \u201cDefendant argues the State failed to prove him guilty of both offenses beyond a\n             reasonable doubt. Defendant contends only one witness testified defendant participated\n             in methamphetamine production and threw the jar from the Blazer. That witness,\n             Trudeau, was \u2018an admitted liar, methamphetamine addict, and drug dealer,\u2019 who had a\n             motive to testify falsely. Defendant maintains, because of this, Trudeau\u2019s testimony\n             was unbelievable and his convictions should be overturned.\u201d Fathauer, 2013 IL App\n             (4th) 120424-U, \u00b6 32.\n\u00b6 21      This court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Id. \u00b6 2. In doing so, we noted as follows:\n             \u201cThe jury was informed of Trudeau\u2019s conduct and pending methamphetamine-related\n             charges, as well as Trudeau\u2019s alleged purchase of stolen auto parts. Defense counsel\n             cross-examined Trudeau regarding his motive to lie and of his anticipation of receiving\n             probation for the offense. The jury, who heard Trudeau and the other witnesses testify,\n             apparently believed Trudeau, in spite of his alleged motive to lie and his\n             methamphetamine addiction. This determination lies within the role of the jury.\n             [Citation.] The record does not establish this decision was unreasonable or unreliable.\u201d\n             Id. \u00b6 38.\n\n\u00b6 22                                  B. The Postconviction Petition\n\u00b6 23       At some point following defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence, the judge assigned to\n       defendant\u2019s case retired, and a new judge was assigned for all further proceedings.\n\u00b6 24       In February 2014, defendant pro se filed a postconviction petition in which he alleged he\n       was denied (1) a fair trial, (2) due process, (3) effective assistance of trial counsel, and\n       (4) effective assistance of appellate counsel. In his first claim, defendant argued he was\n       convicted by Trudeau\u2019s allegedly false testimony. Defendant cited inconsistencies between the\n       statements Trudeau made while talking to the police and his testimony at trial.\n\u00b6 25       Defendant attached to his petition selected transcripts of Trudeau\u2019s trial testimony and\n       transcripts from the May 22, 2010, interviews by Shane Overby, a detective with the\n       Springfield Police Department. During his first interview, Trudeau told Overby he left items\n       at Maaco when he was fired. These items included parts taken from a Chevy S10. Trudeau\n       stated he saw the parts and purchased them because he could get rid of them or \u201cuse them on\n       some other things.\u201d When asked why he would risk purchasing stolen property, Trudeau\n       responded he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it that big a deal.\u201d When Overby asked if any parts were purchased\n       and put on his car or truck, Trudeau said no. Trudeau stated he did not manufacture\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f       methamphetamine for sale, only for his own use. The following questioning occurred regarding\n       the amount consumed around the time of the arrest:\n                   \u201c[Detective Overby (DO)]: *** When\u2019s the last time you cooked I should say that?\n               Cause you smoked this morning so\u2014\n                   [Daron Trudeau (DT)]: Probably 150 pills I think.\n                   DO: Okay[,] and about how much is that?\n                   DT: Probably[\u2014]three grams probably.\n                   DO: Okay, alright, anybody else doing it with you?\n                   DT: Nope[,] just myself.\n                   DO: Okay\u2014Nick [(defendant)] obviously[.]\n                   DT: Nick[,] yea[h].\u201d\n\u00b6 26       Trudeau told Overby he had been cooking methamphetamine for \u201c[m]aybe a month or\n       two.\u201d Trudeau reported defendant threw the \u201cpipe and bag\u201d from the Blazer. Trudeau did not\n       know a jar had been thrown out. Trudeau denied throwing anything from the vehicle but then\n       stated he threw out a pipe. Defendant also attached specific pages of Trudeau\u2019s trial testimony.\n\u00b6 27       Regarding ineffective assistance of trial counsel, defendant argued that counsel failed to\n       scientifically test spots on his clothing. (At trial, the State presented evidence that defendant\n       had spots on his shirt and pants and the spot on the pants tested positive for methamphetamine.)\n       Defendant further asserted that \u201c[t]rial counsel\u2019s lack of pretrial investigation deprived [him]\n       of a potential defense. [Citation.] In the case at bar, had trial counsel properly prepared for trial\n       by investigating [Trudeau\u2019s] initial interview given [on] May 22, 2010, and had the interview\n       been presented at trial, [defendant] would not have been convicted through false testimony by\n       the State.\u201d\n\u00b6 28       Defendant\u2019s other claims are not at issue in this appeal.\n\u00b6 29       In April 2014, the trial court advanced defendant\u2019s petition to the second stage of\n       postconviction proceedings by appointing counsel to represent defendant. Later that month,\n       the State filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that defendant\u2019s claims were (1) barred by\n       res judicata, (2) insufficiently pleaded, and (3) unsupported by the record.\n\n\u00b6 30                                     C. The Motion to Withdraw\n\u00b6 31       In August 2015, defendant\u2019s appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. In\n       his motion, counsel cited Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 21, and explained that counsel appointed\n       at the second stage of postconviction proceedings must \u201cset forth some explanation as to why\n       the petition is in fact without merit\u201d and must do so for each of defendant\u2019s pro se claims\n       before a trial court can permit counsel to withdraw.\n\u00b6 32       In his motion, postconviction counsel listed each of defendant\u2019s claims and explained why\n       they were in fact meritless. Postconviction counsel further addressed defendant\u2019s assertion that\n       he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel when trial counsel failed to conduct a\n       pretrial investigation of Trudeau\u2019s interview, as follows:\n                       \u201cPetitioner also asserts that trial counsel\u2019s lack of pretrial investigation deprived\n                   him of a potential defense. Specifically, Petitioner argues that if trial counsel had\n                   investigated the initial interview Trudeau gave on May 22, 2010, and presented this\n                   interview at trial, then Petitioner would not have been convicted by false testimony.\n\n\n                                                     -5-\n\f                    There is no evidence that appears from the record to support the conclusion that\n                Trudeau gave false testimony at trial. Trial counsel had the opportunity to\n                cross[-]examine Trudeau about the interviews he gave and the veracity of the\n                statements he made to the police during his interviews on May 22, 2010. In fact, trial\n                counsel did cross[-]examine Trudeau on these matters. [Record citation.] Therefore,\n                Petitioner has not demonstrated a deficient performance by trial counsel that caused\n                him prejudice.\u201d\n       Postconviction counsel also noted that \u201c[t]rial counsel effectively cross[-]examined five of the\n       State\u2019s nine witnesses.\u201d Regarding defendant\u2019s claim that he was convicted by false testimony,\n       postconviction counsel explained that the issue was argued and rejected on direct appeal and\n       was therefore barred by res judicata. Counsel attached an affidavit averring he complied with\n       Illinois Supreme Court Rule 651(c) (eff. Feb. 6, 2013).\n\n\u00b6 33                                  D. The Trial Court\u2019s Rulings\n\u00b6 34       In May 2016, the trial court conducted a hearing on postconviction counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw. Counsel noted that he had met with defendant and explained to defendant why\n       counsel believed the claims were meritless. Defendant objected to counsel\u2019s motion to\n       withdraw. The trial court granted postconviction counsel\u2019s motion but did not rule on the\n       State\u2019s motion to dismiss. The circuit clerk filed a notice of appeal on defendant\u2019s behalf. This\n       court concluded the motion to withdraw was not a final order from which defendant could\n       appeal; accordingly, we lacked jurisdiction to review defendant\u2019s claim. Fathauer, 2017 IL\n       App (4th) 160364-U, \u00b6 18. We remanded the case for further proceedings. Id. \u00b6 20.\n\u00b6 35       In March 2018, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\u00b6 36       This appeal followed.\n\n\u00b6 37                                         II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 38       Defendant appeals, arguing the trial court erred by granting postconviction counsel\u2019s\n       motion to withdraw because (1) defendant\u2019s petition stated a claim for ineffective assistance\n       of counsel and (2) postconviction counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to amend\n       the pro se petition. We disagree and affirm.\n\n\u00b6 39                                      A. The Applicable Law\n\u00b6 40       The Act provides a criminal defendant the means to redress substantial violations of his\n       constitutional rights that occurred in his original trial or sentencing. People v. Crenshaw, 2015\n       IL App (4th) 131035, \u00b6 23, 38 N.E.3d 1256; 725 ILCS 5/122-1 (West 2014). The Act contains\n       a three-stage procedure for relief. People v. Allen, 2015 IL 113135, \u00b6 21, 32 N.E.3d 615; 725\n       ILCS 5/122-2.1 (West 2014). Within the first 90 days after the petition is filed and docketed,\n       the trial court shall dismiss a petition summarily if the court determines it is \u201cfrivolous or is\n       patently without merit.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122-2.1(a)(2) (West 2014). A petition may be dismissed\n       as frivolous or patently without merit only if the petition has no arguable basis either in law or\n       in fact. Allen, 2015 IL 113135, \u00b6 25. \u201cA petition which lacks an arguable basis either in law or\n       in fact is one which is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory or a fanciful factual\n       allegation. An example of an indisputably meritless legal theory is one which is completely\n       contradicted by the record.\u201d People v. Hodges, 234 Ill. 2d 1, 16, 912 N.E.2d 1204, 1212 (2009).\n\n\n                                                   -6-\n\f       Because most postconviction petitions are drafted by pro se defendants, \u201cthe threshold for a\n       petition to survive the first stage of review is low.\u201d Allen, 2015 IL 113135, \u00b6 24. If a petition\n       alleges sufficient facts to state the gist of a constitutional claim, first-stage dismissal is\n       inappropriate. Id. If the petition is not dismissed as being frivolous or patently without merit,\n       then the trial court orders the petition to be docketed for further consideration. 725 ILCS 5/122-\n       2.1(b) (West 2014).\n\u00b6 41        At the second stage, the trial court appoints counsel, who must then investigate defendant\u2019s\n       claims and make any amendments necessary for an adequate presentation of defendant\u2019s\n       contentions. Ill. S. Ct. R. 651(c) (eff. Feb. 6, 2013). The State may file a motion to dismiss the\n       petition, and the petition advances to a third-stage evidentiary hearing only if defendant makes\n       a \u201csubstantial showing of a constitutional violation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n       People v. Johnson, 2018 IL App (5th) 140486, \u00b6 22, 99 N.E.3d 1.\n\u00b6 42        The right to counsel in postconviction proceedings is statutory rather than constitutional,\n       and therefore a defendant is entitled only to the level of assistance guaranteed by the Act.\n       People v. Greer, 212 Ill. 2d 192, 203, 817 N.E.2d 511, 518-19 (2004). The Illinois Supreme\n       Court has determined that the Act and Rule 651 require appointed counsel to provide only\n       reasonable assistance, a lower standard than that which the constitution requires at trial.\n       Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 15. Rule 651(c) outlines certain duties that postconviction counsel\n       must perform in order to provide reasonable assistance. Id. Counsel must (1) consult with the\n       defendant to determine the issues defendant wants to raise, (2) examine the record of the\n       proceedings in the trial court, and (3) make any amendment to the petition necessary to\n       adequately preserve defendant\u2019s contentions. Id. However, postconviction counsel is not\n       required to present frivolous or meritless claims and must withdraw if counsel cannot advance\n       any arguably meritorious claims. Id.\n\u00b6 43        The requirements postconviction counsel must meet to withdraw vary depending on how\n       the petition advanced to the second stage. See id. \u00b6 19. If the petition advanced by default\u2014\n       that is, the trial court did not take any action on the petition within 90 days of filing\u2014counsel\n       \u201cshould make some effort to explain why defendant\u2019s claims are frivolous or patently without\n       merit.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Greer, 212 Ill. 2d at 212. However, a trial court may grant a motion\n       to withdraw in such a case when the record has demonstrated \u201cin fact\u201d that defendant\u2019s claims\n       are patently without merit and counsel has complied with Rule 651(c). Kuehner, 2015 IL\n       117695, \u00b6 16.\n\u00b6 44        When a trial court advances a petition to the second stage within 90 days, it is presumed\n       that the court has made a finding that the petition was not frivolous or patently without merit\n       on its face. Johnson, 2018 IL App (5th) 140486, \u00b6 42; Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 20. In this\n       instance, when postconviction counsel determines a motion to withdraw is necessary, counsel\n       is essentially filing a motion to reconsider the trial court\u2019s initial ruling. Kuehner, 2015 IL\n       117695, \u00b6 21. As a result, \u201cappointed counsel owes the trial court at least some explanation as\n       to why, despite its superficial virtue, the pro se petition is in fact frivolous or patently without\n       merit, and counsel owes this explanation with respect to each of the defendant\u2019s pro se claims.\u201d\n       (Emphasis in original.) Id. Similar to a motion to reconsider, a motion to withdraw \u201cdoes not\n       ask the trial court to conduct its first-stage assessment a second time but rather seeks to bring\n       to the trial court\u2019s attention information that was not apparent on the face of the pro se petition\n       at the time such assessment was made.\u201d Id.\n\n\n                                                    -7-\n\f\u00b6 45                               B. The Kuehner Analysis in This Case\n\u00b6 46       Defendant first argues postconviction counsel should not have been permitted to withdraw\n       because his petition stated the gist of a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of trial\n       counsel. Specifically, defendant asserts the petition alleges trial counsel (1) failed to\n       investigate police interviews of Trudeau and (2) \u201cfail[ed] to effectively cross-examine Trudeau\n       with his prior inconsistent statements and counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Trudeau\u2019s credibility.\u201d\n\u00b6 47       Kuehner requires a two-step analysis. First, we determine whether the trial court advanced\n       the petition to the second stage on the merits based upon its conclusion that the petition stated\n       the gist of a constitutional claim. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. Second, we evaluate whether postconviction\n       counsel provided \u201cat least some explanation as to why, despite its superficial virtue, the pro se\n       petition [was] in fact frivolous or patently without merit *** with respect to each of the\n       defendant\u2019s pro se claims.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. \u00b6 21.\n\u00b6 48       Here, the State does not argue that the petition was not advanced to the second stage on the\n       merits, and the record demonstrates that the trial court appointed counsel well within the 90-\n       day time limit. Because the court advanced the petition to the second stage, we presume that\n       the trial court made an initial determination that defendant\u2019s petition stated the gist of a\n       constitutional claim. Appointing counsel is all that the Act requires to advance a petition to the\n       second stage, and the trial court need not comment on the potential merit of a defendant\u2019s\n       pro se claims.\n\u00b6 49       Regarding the second step, defendant raised four issues in his petition, and postconviction\n       counsel addressed each of those four issues in his motion to withdraw. Before this court,\n       defendant does not argue that postconviction counsel failed to procedurally comply with\n       Kuehner. Instead, defendant argues the trial court\u2019s decision to allow postconviction counsel\n       to withdraw was incorrect on the merits because his petition stated the gist of a constitutional\n       claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel.\n\u00b6 50       Nevertheless, before reaching the merits, we need to address postconviction counsel\u2019s\n       compliance with Kuehner. The Illinois Supreme Court clearly stated in Kuehner that, \u201cif we\n       were willing to say in Greer that a motion to withdraw should include such explanations when\n       the petition advances to stage two by default, we are now prepared to say that such a motion\n       must include such explanations when the petition advances to the second stage by affirmative\n       judicial action.\u201d (Emphases in original.) Id. \u201c[T]he burden for establishing that [the petition\u2019s\n       claims in fact lack merit] rests squarely on appointed counsel,\u201d and counsel must \u201cmake that\n       case with respect to each and every pro se claim asserted.\u201d Id. \u00b6 22. Counsel is required to\n       \u201creduce his or her findings to writing and to include them in the motion to withdraw so that\n       both the trial court and the reviewing courts have a basis for evaluating counsel\u2019s conclusion.\u201d\n       Id. The court \u201ch[e]ld that, where appointed counsel is either unable or unwilling to make that\n       case with respect to each of the pro se claims contained in the petition, appointed counsel\u2019s\n       motion to withdraw must be denied.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Accordingly, we must address\n       whether postconviction counsel (1) provided some information that was not apparent on the\n       face of the petition that (2) demonstrated each of defendant\u2019s pro se claims was in fact\n       frivolous and patently without merit.\n\n\u00b6 51                          1. Information Not on the Face of the Petition\n\u00b6 52       In Kuehner, the supreme court explained that postconviction counsel\u2019s responsibility was\n       not to \u201cevaluat[e] the facial sufficiency of defendant\u2019s pro se petition\u201d because the trial court\n\n                                                   -8-\n\f       had already made the determination that the petition \u201con its face *** was neither frivolous nor\n       patently without merit.\u201d Id. \u00b6 20. Thus, the court concluded that a motion to withdraw, similar\n       to a motion to reconsider, \u201cdoes not ask the trial court to conduct its first-stage assessment a\n       second time but rather seeks to bring to the trial court\u2019s attention information that was not\n       apparent on the face of the pro se petition at the time such assessment was made.\u201d Id. \u00b6 21.\n\u00b6 53        The information that was not apparent on the face of defendant\u2019s pro se petition included\n       (1) the full trial transcript of Trudeau\u2019s testimony and (2) this court\u2019s decision on direct appeal.\n       We conclude that these types of information are consistent with what the supreme court had in\n       mind when it referenced \u201cinformation that was not apparent on the face of the pro se petition.\u201d\n       Id.\n\u00b6 54        Defendant\u2019s pro se petition made four different claims of a constitutional deprivation. In\n       support of those claims, he attached transcripts of Trudeau\u2019s interviews and select portions of\n       Trudeau\u2019s testimony at trial. Given that the trial court had nothing else to consider when it\n       evaluated defendant\u2019s pro se petition at the first stage, the court concluded that defendant\u2019s\n       pro se petition met the low threshold of stating the gist of a constitutional claim. However,\n       when postconviction counsel provided the trial court with the full transcript of Trudeau\u2019s\n       testimony and this court\u2019s decision on direct appeal, counsel was calling the court\u2019s attention\n       to information that was not apparent at the time the court assessed the facial validity of\n       defendant\u2019s pro se petition as contemplated by Kuehner. Counsel\u2019s doing so met Kuehner\u2019s\n       requirement that, in support of counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, counsel must provide \u201cat least\n       some explanation as to why *** the pro se petition is in fact frivolous or patently without\n       merit.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id.\n\u00b6 55        In this case, the judge that had presided over defendant\u2019s trial retired before defendant filed\n       his postconviction petition. Because the judge who reviewed the postconviction petition was\n       different from the judge who conducted the trial, it is likely that the judge only reviewed the\n       facial validity of the petition and did not comb through the record. However, even a judge that\n       conducted a defendant\u2019s trial would not be expected to remember the prior proceedings without\n       assistance.\n\u00b6 56        The Illinois Supreme Court has stated that, when reviewing a pro se postconviction petition\n       at the first stage, \u201c[t]he court is further foreclosed from engaging in any fact-finding or any\n       review of matters beyond the allegations of the petition.\u201d People v. Boclair, 202 Ill. 2d 89, 99,\n       789 N.E.2d 734, 741 (2002). However, it has also noted that section 122-2.1(c) of the Act\n       states a trial court \u201cmay examine the court file of the proceeding in which the petitioner was\n       convicted, any action taken by an appellate court in such proceeding and any transcripts of\n       such proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 725 ILCS 5/122-2.1(c) (West 2002); People v. Blair, 215\n       Ill. 2d 427, 446, 831 N.E.2d 604, 616 (2005). The trial court may also look to these sources to\n       determine if the petition\u2019s factual or legal allegations are rebutted. Blair, 215 Ill. 2d at 446.\n\u00b6 57        Although a trial court may examine the record, including any appeal and transcripts of\n       proceedings, the court is not required to do so at the first stage, and it is certainly not required\n       to scour the record to determine the petition\u2019s merit. Review of a defendant\u2019s pro se petition is\n       meant to be quick; the trial court has just 90 days to determine if a petition is frivolous or\n       patently without merit. Experience shows that trial courts frequently rely only on the pro se\n       petition itself, and this is to be expected. In short, a trial court at the first stage is not expected\n       or required to review the common-law record or the report of proceedings.\n\n\n                                                      -9-\n\f\u00b6 58       Here, postconviction counsel may have realized that the judge evaluating the pro se\n       petition was unfamiliar with defendant\u2019s case, and counsel may have found it appropriate to\n       simply point out that defendant\u2019s pro se arguments (1) were contradicted by the record and\n       (2) had been raised on direct appeal and rejected by this court. But even if that had not been\n       the case, if after reviewing the record and speaking with the defendant, postconviction counsel\n       determines that all of defendant\u2019s claims are barred by res judicata or contradicted by the\n       record, counsel has an ethical obligation to move to withdraw if he reasonably believes that\n       the trial court erred when it found defendant\u2019s petition had facial merit. Kuehner, 2015 IL\n       117695, \u00b6 22.\n\n\u00b6 59                       2. Explanation That Each Claim Is in Fact Meritless\n\u00b6 60       Having determined that counsel properly moved to withdraw based on information that\n       was not apparent on the face of the pro se petition, we now address whether counsel provided\n       at least some explanation as to why each pro se claim lacked merit. As we noted earlier,\n       defendant does not argue on appeal that postconviction counsel failed to address each claim,\n       and our review of the record confirms that counsel addressed all of the claims raised in\n       defendant\u2019s petition. Instead, defendant argues that postconviction counsel should have\n       recognized that defendant had stated a meritorious claim that trial counsel provided ineffective\n       assistance. Namely, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to \u201ceffectively\u201d cross-examine\n       Trudeau to \u201cdestroy\u201d his credibility. Defendant points out several differences between\n       Trudeau\u2019s answers in the interview transcripts and his trial testimony, and defendant suggests\n       that, had trial counsel impeached Trudeau with those differences, there is a reasonable\n       probability of a different outcome.\n\u00b6 61       In his motion, postconviction counsel addressed this claim and demonstrated it was in fact\n       contradicted by the record. See Hodges, 234 Ill. 2d at 16 (\u201cAn example of an indisputably\n       meritless legal theory is one which is completely contradicted by the record.\u201d). In his motion\n       to withdraw, postconviction counsel stated as follows:\n                   \u201cPetitioner also asserts that trial counsel\u2019s lack of pretrial investigation deprived\n               him of a potential defense. Specifically, Petitioner argues that if trial counsel had\n               investigated the initial interview Trudeau gave on May 22, 2010, and presented this\n               interview at trial, then Petition[er] would not have been convicted by false testimony.\n                   There is no evidence that appears from the record to support the conclusion that\n               Trudeau gave false testimony at trial. Trial counsel had the opportunity to\n               cross[-]examine Trudeau about the interviews he gave and the veracity of the\n               statements he made to the police during his interviews on May 22, 2010. In fact, trial\n               counsel did cross[-]examine Trudeau on these matters. [Citation.] Therefore, Petitioner\n               has not demonstrated a deficient performance by trial counsel that caused him\n               prejudice.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\u00b6 62       Our review of the trial testimony confirms postconviction counsel\u2019s assertions. Trial\n       counsel was in fact aware of all three of Trudeau\u2019s interviews and specifically cross-examined\n       Trudeau regarding his prior statements in those interviews. Trial counsel even went so far as\n       to read directly from portions of the interview transcripts in an effort to confront Trudeau with\n       his inconsistent statements. \u201cGenerally, the decision whether or not to cross-examine or\n       impeach a witness is a matter of trial strategy which will not support a claim of ineffective\n       assistance of counsel.\u201d People v. Pecoraro, 175 Ill. 2d 294, 326, 677 N.E.2d 875, 891 (1997).\n\n                                                  - 10 -\n\f       \u201cDefendant can only prevail on an ineffectiveness claim by showing that counsel\u2019s approach\n       to cross-examination was objectively unreasonable.\u201d Id. at 327. Accordingly, in his motion to\n       withdraw, postconviction counsel presented the record, which contradicted defendant\u2019s\n       allegations, and provided an explanation that defendant\u2019s postconviction petition was in fact\n       meritless because Trudeau was in fact cross-examined. Although cross-examination could\n       have been done differently, defendant\u2019s claims that (1) trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination was\n       so deficient that it caused defendant prejudice or (2) the cross-examination was anything other\n       than the product of trial strategy are completely without merit.\n\u00b6 63       Moreover, this court\u2019s prior decision on defendant\u2019s direct appeal confirms that Trudeau\n       was \u201ceffectively\u201d cross-examined. We noted that \u201cTrudeau admitted his testimony differed\n       from what he initially told the police during his three interviews.\u201d Fathauer, 2013 IL App (4th)\n       120424-U, \u00b6 20. We further noted as follows:\n               \u201cThe jury was informed of Trudeau\u2019s conduct and pending methamphetamine-related\n               charges, as well as Trudeau\u2019s alleged purchase of stolen auto parts. Defense counsel\n               cross-examined Trudeau regarding his motive to lie and of his anticipation of receiving\n               probation for the offense. The jury, who heard Trudeau and the other witnesses testify,\n               apparently believed Trudeau, in spite of his alleged motive to lie and his\n               methamphetamine addiction. This determination lies within the role of the jury.\n               [Citation.] The record does not establish this decision was unreasonable or unreliable.\u201d\n               Id. \u00b6 38.\n\u00b6 64       Despite defendant\u2019s claims, postconviction counsel was therefore correct when he stated\n       that \u201c[t]rial counsel effectively cross[-]examined five of the State\u2019s nine witnesses\u201d and\n       \u201c[defendant] has not demonstrated a deficient performance by trial counsel that caused him\n       prejudice.\u201d Accordingly, postconviction counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw (1) brought \u201cto the trial\n       court\u2019s attention information that was not apparent on the face of the pro se petition at the\n       time\u201d the court determined it had merit and (2) explained \u201cwhy, despite its superficial virtue,\n       the pro se petition [was] in fact frivolous or patently without merit\u201d as to each and every claim.\n       (Emphasis in original.) Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 21.\n\u00b6 65       We note that postconviction counsel cited Kuehner in his motion to withdraw, and at the\n       hearing on his motion, counsel reiterated to the trial court that this court had previously\n       reviewed defendant\u2019s contentions about the credibility of Trudeau. Citing recent Illinois\n       Supreme Court precedent directly on point is always a good idea, and we commend\n       postconviction counsel for doing so. We further note that attorneys appointed in postconviction\n       proceedings who believe they must withdraw would be well served by making explicit, both\n       in their motion and at any hearing, the information not apparent on the face of the pro se\n       petition that counsel is bringing to the trial court\u2019s attention. Additionally, although not\n       required, trial courts would do well to make an explicit finding that postconviction counsel\n       complied with Kuehner and set forth on the record (1) the additional information\n       postconviction counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention and (2) that counsel has addressed each\n       of defendant\u2019s pro se claims.\n\n\u00b6 66                       C. Ineffective Assistance of Postconviction Counsel\n\u00b6 67       Defendant also asserts he was denied effective assistance of postconviction counsel\n       because counsel should have amended his pro se petition to demonstrate that trial counsel\n       failed to effectively cross-examine Trudeau. However, as we have just explained, any such\n\n                                                   - 11 -\n\f       argument was contradicted by the record, and \u201can indisputably meritless legal theory is one\n       which is completely contradicted by the record.\u201d Hodges, 234 Ill. 2d at 16. Postconviction\n       counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to assert a meritless claim. Greer, 212 Ill.\n       2d at 205 (explaining that counsel is not required to advance frivolous claims because such\n       claims are not \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Rule 651(c)).\n\u00b6 68       Further, we note that the record demonstrates that postconviction counsel complied with\n       Rule 651(c). In addition to his Rule 651(c) affidavit, at the hearing on his motion to withdraw,\n       postconviction counsel repeatedly mentioned that he had met with defendant and explained\n       why he felt he had to withdraw from representation. Defendant acknowledged these efforts but\n       expressed his disagreement with counsel\u2019s decision. The Act entitles defendant to a reasonable\n       level of assistance, and a defendant receives such assistance when counsel complies with the\n       requirements of Rule 651(c). Kuehner, 2015 IL 117695, \u00b6 15. Based on our review of the\n       record, we conclude that postconviction counsel in fact \u201c(1) consulted with the petitioner to\n       ascertain his allegations of deprivation of constitutional rights; (2) examined the record of\n       proceedings at trial; and (3) made any amendments to [the] pro se petition[ ] that [were]\n       necessary to adequately present the petitioner\u2019s allegations.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 69                                      III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 70      For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\u00b6 71      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 12 -\n\f",
