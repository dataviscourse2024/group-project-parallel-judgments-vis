D-1-DC-12-205144, HONORABLE JON N. WISSER, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                              MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n                Richard Cartrell Haynes was charged with burglary of a habitation. See Tex. Penal\n\nCode \u00a7 30.02(a) (prohibiting crime of burglary), (c)(2) (setting offense level for burglary of habitation).\n\nAfter a trial, the jury found Haynes guilty of the charged offense. Subsequently, Haynes pleaded\n\ntrue to 2 felony-enhancement allegations, and the district court imposed a sentence of 30 years\u2019\n\nimprisonment. See id. \u00a7 12.42 (elevating permissible punishment range for repeat-felony offenders).\n\nHaynes appeals his conviction, and we will affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction.\n\n\n                                             DISCUSSION\n\n                On appeal, Haynes contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that the\n\nstructure that he entered was a habitation. In particular, he argues that there was no proof that the\n\nstructure was adapted \u201cfor overnight accommodation of persons.\u201d When making this argument,\n\nHaynes notes that no evidence was introduced showing that the structure had bedrooms, a kitchen,\n\for household furnishings. Accordingly, he asks this Court to reform his judgment to reflect a\n\nconviction for the lesser-included offense of burglary of a building or of criminal trespass.\n\n                Under the Penal Code, an individual commits burglary \u201cif, without the effective\n\nconsent of the owner, the person . . . enters a habitation, or a building (or any portion of a building)\n\nnot then open to the public, with intent to commit a felony, theft, or an assault.\u201d Tex. Penal Code\n\n\u00a7 30.02(a)(1). As mentioned above, Haynes does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nshowing that he entered a structure with the intent to commit theft; on the contrary, he only asserts\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to show that the structure was a habitation. The Penal Code\n\ndefines \u201c[h]abitation\u201d as \u201ca structure or vehicle that is adapted for the overnight accommodation of\n\npersons, and includes: (A) each separately secured or occupied portion of the structure or vehicle;\n\nand (B) each structure appurtenant to or connected with the structure or vehicle.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30.01(1).\n\nA determination regarding whether a particular structure is suitable for overnight accommodations\n\ninvolves complex and subjective fact questions, which are well-suited for resolution by juries.\n\nSalazar v. State, 284 S.W.3d 874, 877 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). When making this determination,\n\njuries may consider \u201cthe type of structure,\u201d \u201cits typical use,\u201d and its contents, \u201cincluding bedding,\n\nelectricity, plumbing, or furniture.\u201d Id. The jury may also consider \u201cwhether someone was using\n\nthe structure . . . as a residence at the time of the offense.\u201d Blankenship v. State, 780 S.W.2d 198,\n\n209 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989) (op. on reh\u2019g).\n\n                In a legal-sufficiency review, appellate courts view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict and determine whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319\n\n(1979). When performing this analysis, a reviewing court must bear in mind that it is the fact-\n\n\n                                                   2\n\ffinder\u2019s duty to weigh the evidence, to resolve conflicts in the testimony, and to make reasonable\n\ninferences \u201cfrom basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d Id. Furthermore, reviewing courts must \u201cdetermine\n\nwhether the necessary inferences are reasonable based upon the combined and cumulative force of\n\nall the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.\u201d Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d\n\n9, 16-17 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Moreover, reviewing courts presume that conflicting inferences\n\nwere resolved in favor of the conviction and defer to that resolution. Clayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d\n\n772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\n               The structure at issue is a home owned by John Waltrip. During the trial, Waltrip\n\nexplained that he has lived in the home since 2007 and continued to live in the home after the\n\nincident. Further, he related that although he was not present at the time of the alleged offense\n\nbecause he spent the night at his girlfriend\u2019s house, he was home the day before. In addition, he\n\nstated that his home had a working alarm system. Further, when describing the damage that had\n\nbeen done, Waltrip mentioned that his home had a laundry room.\n\n               In addition to the testimony from Waltrip, the State admitted pictures of the\n\nhome as exhibits. Those pictures reveal that the structure was a single-family home with a brick\n\nexterior, a roof, a laundry room, an attached garage, and a paved driveway.1 See Jones v. State,\n\n\n       1\n          In his brief, Haynes cites Chandler v. State for the proposition that a structure\u2019s outside\nappearance is irrelevant. 743 S.W.2d 736, 738 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1987) (\u201cChandler I\u201d).\nHowever, we find Haynes\u2019s reliance on this case misplaced. On appeal, that opinion was reversed\nby the court of criminal appeals. Chandler v. State, 790 S.W.2d 635 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).\nMoreover, the court of criminal appeals noted that the primary precedent relied on in Chandler I had\nrecently been overruled and that a new \u201cstandard for determining sufficiency of the evidence to show\na structure is a habitation\u201d had been established. Id. at 635 (noting that Jones v. State, 532 S.W.2d\n596 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976), was overruled by Blankenship v. State, 780 S.W.2d 198 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1989) (op. on reh\u2019g)); see also Blankenship, 780 S.W.2d at 209 (authorizing consideration\nof type of structure \u201c(e.g. house, apartment, condominium . . . )\u201d when deciding if structure is\naccommodation).\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 01-09-00267-CR, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 10279, at *15 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.]\n\nDec. 30, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (concluding that structure was\n\nhabitation after considering, among other evidence, photos showing \u201cthat the house was a\n\nfully-enclosed, brick, one-story, single-family dwelling with a roof, a paved driveway, and an\n\nattached garage\u201d and explaining that single-family residences are intended to be used to\n\naccommodate people overnight); cf. Hicks v. State, 204 S.W.3d 505, 507 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo\n\n2006, no pet.) (mem. op.) (determining that \u201cminimal evidence cited by\u201d defendant would not\n\nhave permitted \u201ca rational factfinder to conclude that . . . [structure] was only a building and not\n\na habitation\u201d when evidence showed that structure was designed to be lived in, was wired for\n\nelectricity, had running water and gas, had kitchen and bathroom, and had appliances and noting\n\nthat \u201cno other evidence appears of record suggesting that the structure lacked the status as a\n\nhabitation\u201d). Moreover, the pictures seem to depict that the structure was fully enclosed. Further,\n\nthe pictures show that the home contained appliances, clothing, a bicycle, tools, and cleaning\n\nsupplies. In addition, the photos demonstrate that the home had working electricity because an\n\nexterior light is illuminated in several of the photos. Cf. In re E.P., 963 S.W.2d 191, 192 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Austin 1998, no pet.) (concluding that evidence was sufficient to show that vacant unit\n\nwas habitation when evidence showed, among other things, that apartment was surrounded by\n\nother units and had running electricity and water). Furthermore, a video from the dashboard camera\n\nof one of the responding officers was admitted as an exhibit, and that video depicts the home in a\n\nresidential neighborhood with accompanying bike lanes.2\n\n\n       2\n        As support for his assertion that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction,\nHaynes primarily relies on Moss v. State, 574 S.W.2d 542 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978). However, we\n\n                                                 4\n\f                 In light of all of the evidence summarized above as well as the reasonable inferences\n\nthat the fact-finder could have made from that evidence and given that the standard of review for\n\nlegal-sufficiency challenges obligates appellate courts to defer to the fact-finder\u2019s resolution of\n\nconflicts in the testimony and to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, see\n\nJackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778; Hooper, 214 S.W.3d at 16-17, we cannot\n\nconclude that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that the\n\nstructure was a habitation. Accordingly, we overrule Haynes\u2019s issue on appeal.\n\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n                 Having overruled Haynes\u2019s issue on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment\n\nof conviction.\n\n\n\n                                               __________________________________________\n\n                                               David Puryear, Justice\n\nBefore Justices Puryear, Goodwin, and Field\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: September 16, 2014\n\nDo Not Publish\n\n\n\n\nfind Moss to be distinguishable from the circumstances present in this case. In Moss, the structure\nat issue had not been occupied for several months and had no running water. Id. at 544-45. In\naddition, there was evidence showing that the structure had no light bulbs and that the \u201cstove and\nheaters were not connected.\u201d Id. at 545. Moreover, the owner of the property testified that the items\nthat were in the house were there \u201cfor storage only, and that in order to rent the house she would\nhave had to move them out and install other furniture and appliances.\u201d Id.\n\n                                                   5\n\f",
