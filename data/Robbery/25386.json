When [Victim] arrived in\n           Bentleyville, [Mr.] Muniz was waiting with Appellant\u2026.\n           [Mr.] Muniz sat in [Victim\u2019s] passenger seat and Appellant\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n    18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2702(a)(4); 2701(a)(1); 2709(a)(1), respectively.\n\n\n_____________________________\n\n*Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S86032-16\n\n\n         entered the backseat when [Mr.] Muniz changed the\n         destination from Centerville to Brownsville. [Victim] took\n         the men to two locations in Brownsville. At the second\n         location, [Mr.] Muniz and Appellant exited the vehicle and\n         met people parked in another car nearby. [Mr.] Muniz and\n         Appellant returned to [Victim\u2019s] vehicle, entering the same\n         seats, and asked to be returned to the first location.\n         [Victim] became frustrated driving the men around and\n         said he would never do anything like this for them again.\n         At that point, [Victim] felt an object hit the back of his\n         head and Appellant said[,] \u201cdon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 move.\u201d\n\n         According to [Victim], his \u201cnatural instinct\u201d was to fight\n         back by knocking whatever Appellant had in his hand down\n         and then fighting to contain Appellant. [Mr.] Muniz pulled\n         the keys from the ignition, locked the door, and then\n         began to choke [Victim]. [Victim] attempted to exit, but\n         the door was locked and he began to be struck in the head\n         a few times. [Victim] identified Commonwealth Exhibit 1\u2014\n         namely, a .22 Ruger revolver, as being the item he was\n         struck in the head with by Appellant. [Victim] sustained\n         two lacerations to the back of his head, felt a headache for\n         five days, and described the pain as a nine out of ten.\n\n         All of the men exited the vehicle and [Victim] was going\n         towards [Mr.] Muniz when [Mr.] Muniz asked Appellant for\n         \u201cthe piece.\u201d Appellant threw a punch at [Victim] and\n         missed when [Victim] pulled a pocketknife from his pocket\n         and struck Appellant. [Victim] screamed for a bystander\n         about one hundred yards away to call the police which\n         caused Appellant and [Mr.] Muniz to run away. [Victim]\n         screamed at [Mr.] Muniz for his keys, [Mr.] Muniz\n         responded they were on the floor, and [Victim] was able to\n         leave the scene. When questioned by Pennsylvania State\n         Police Officer Joseph Timms, [Victim] directed the police to\n         the wooded area where [Mr.] Muniz and Appellant ran and\n         the police recovered the gun in that area.\n\n(Trial Court Opinion, filed June 13, 2016, at 2-3) (internal citations omitted).\n\n      Procedurally, the Commonwealth charged Appellant with aggravated\n\nassault, simple assault, three counts of robbery, theft, and summary\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-S86032-16\n\n\nharassment. Appellant proceeded to a jury trial on April 4, 2016. On April\n\n5, 2016, the jury convicted Appellant of aggravated assault and simple\n\nassault; the court convicted Appellant of summary harassment.          The jury\n\nfound Appellant not guilty on the remaining charges. The court sentenced\n\nAppellant on May 5, 2016, to an aggregate term of twenty-four (24) to\n\nforty-eight (48) months\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant timely filed post-sentence\n\nmotions challenging the weight of the evidence on May 6, 2016, which the\n\ncourt denied on May 9, 2016. Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal on\n\nMay 12, 2016.      On May 20, 2016, the court ordered Appellant to file a\n\nconcise statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.\n\n1925(b), which Appellant timely filed on June 2, 2016.\n\n      Appellant raises two issues for our review:\n\n         WHETHER THE COURT ERRED BY DENYING APPELLANT\u2019S\n         MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL WHEN THE VERDICT WAS\n         AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE?\n\n         WHETHER THE COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO STRIKE THE\n         UNSOLICITED COMMENT MADE BY THE ALLEGED\n         VICTIM\u2026DURING CROSS-EXAMINATION THAT HE WAS\n         TOLD NOT TO CALL 911?\n\n(Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3).\n\n      When examining a challenge to the weight of the evidence, our\n\nstandard of review is as follows:\n\n            The weight of the evidence is exclusively for the\n            finder of fact who is free to believe all, part, or none\n            of the evidence and to determine the credibility of\n            the witnesses. An appellate court cannot substitute\n            its judgment for that of the finder of fact. Thus, we\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S86032-16\n\n\n             may only reverse the\u2026verdict if it is so contrary to\n             the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice.\n\n          Moreover, where the trial court has ruled on the weight\n          claim below, an appellate court\u2019s role is not to consider the\n          underlying question of whether the verdict is against the\n          weight of the evidence. Rather, appellate review is limited\n          to whether the trial court palpably abused its discretion in\n          ruling on the weight claim.\n\nCommonwealth v. Champney, 574 Pa. 435, 444, 832 A.2d 403, 408\n\n(2003), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 939, 124 S.Ct. 2906, 159 L.Ed.2d 816 (2004)\n\n(internal citations omitted). A \u201ctrial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial\n\nbased on a weight of the evidence claim is the least assailable of its rulings.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Rivera, 603 Pa. 340, 363, 983 A.2d 1211, 1225\n\n(2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 909, 130 S.Ct. 3282, 176 L.Ed.2d 1191\n\n(2010).\n\n      Additionally, the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s admission or\n\nexclusion of evidence is well established and very narrow:\n\n          Questions concerning the admissibility of evidence lie\n          within the sound discretion of the trial court, and a\n          reviewing court will not reverse the court\u2019s decision on\n          such a question absent a clear abuse of discretion. An\n          abuse of discretion is not merely an error of judgment, but\n          is rather the overriding or misapplication of the law, or the\n          exercise of judgment that is manifestly unreasonable, or\n          the result of bias, prejudice, ill-will or partiality, as shown\n          by the evidence of record.\n\nCommonwealth v. Hyland, 875 A.2d 1175, 1185-86 (Pa.Super. 2005),\n\nappeal denied, 586 Pa. 723, 890 A.2d 1057 (2005) (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted).       Further, \u201c[t]o constitute reversible error, an\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fJ-S86032-16\n\n\nevidentiary ruling must not only be erroneous, but also harmful or prejudicial\n\nto the complaining party.\u201d Commonwealth v. Robertson, 874 A.2d 1200,\n\n1209 (Pa.Super. 2005) (internal citation omitted).\n\n      After a thorough review of the record, the briefs of the parties, the\n\napplicable law, and the well-reasoned opinion of the Honorable Nancy D.\n\nVernon, we conclude Appellant\u2019s issues merit no relief.       The trial court\n\nopinion comprehensively discusses and properly disposes of the questions\n\npresented.   (See Trial Court Opinion at 3-6) (finding: (1) jury\u2019s verdict is\n\nconsistent with evidence presented at trial; jury credited Victim\u2019s testimony;\n\nas verdict was not contrary to evidence it does not shock one\u2019s sense of\n\njustice; verdict was not against weight of evidence, so court properly denied\n\nAppellant\u2019s motion for new trial; (2) during cross-examination of Victim,\n\ndefense counsel elicited testimony from Victim that he did not call 911\n\nwhen he got home on evening in question because \u201c[he] was told not to\u201d;\n\nAppellant fails to explain how he was prejudiced by Victim\u2019s response;\n\ndefense counsel elicited response, and Victim did not attribute statement as\n\ncoming from any identifiable source; Appellant cannot show abuse of\n\ndiscretion or prejudice).   Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s opinion.\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fJ-S86032-16\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
