On September 23, 2010, Defendant-\nAppellant James Wooten robbed the Green Bank in Gordonsville, Tennessee. During\nthe robbery, Wooten casually approached a teller, placed his hands on the counter, and\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v. Wooten                                         Page 2\n\n\ntwice quietly stated, \u201cI am going to rob you.\u201d R. 41 (Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr. at 5). At first,\nWooten\u2019s demeanor left the teller with doubts as to the sincerity of Wooten\u2019s demand.\nWhen the teller was slow to respond, Wooten finally said, \u201cI have a gun. Give me your\nmoney,\u201d at which point, the teller handed over approximately $4,130 in cash. Id.;\nPresentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) \u00b6 5, at 4.\n\n       Wooten pleaded guilty to one count of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).\nBased on Wooten\u2019s declaration that he had a gun, the district court imposed a two-level\nsentencing enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cGuideline\u201d\nor \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) for making a threat of death. Wooten challenges the\nenhancement and maintains that, in spite of his use of the phrase \u201cI have a gun,\u201d his\nconduct and demeanor were so nonthreatening as to eliminate the possibility that any\nreasonable teller under the circumstances would have believed his or her life to be in\ndanger. Under the specific circumstances of this case, we agree. Accordingly, we\nREVERSE the district court\u2019s imposition of the sentencing enhancement, VACATE\nWooten\u2019s sentence, and REMAND the case for resentencing in accordance with this\nopinion.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       At Wooten\u2019s sentencing hearing, bank teller Buddy Mason recalled the\ncircumstances of the September 23 robbery. According to Mason, the robbery began\nafter Wooten walked \u201ccasually\u201d into the bank and approached the teller row.\nR. 41 (Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr. at 5). Wooten, who was fifty-six years old at the time, wore\nordinary clothing and appeared to Mason to be a routine customer. After entering,\nWooten strolled over and placed one hand on the counter. According to Mason, Wooten\nwas \u201cnot looking around or fidgeting or looking at anything\u201d and his demeanor was\n\u201cnonchalant.\u201d Id. After motioning for Mason to lean in closer, Wooten \u201ckind of\nwhispered and said, I am going to rob you.\u201d Id. at 5. Mason at first thought Wooten was\n\u201cjoking around.\u201d Id. at 11. Indeed, Mason recalled that he was \u201cnot taking [the robbery]\nvery seriously because [Wooten] was just so nonthreatening.\u201d Id. at 9. With prompting\nfrom Mason, Wooten repeated the statement \u201cI am going to rob you,\u201d and Mason again\n\fNo. 11-5348             United States v. Wooten                                                      Page 3\n\n\nquestioned the sincerity of Wooten\u2019s request. Id. at 5. At that point, Wooten \u201ckind of\ngot a serious look in his face\u201d and said, \u201cI have a gun, I want your money.\u201d Id.1\n\n         Mason testified that the bank had instructed all employees to give money to a\nbank robber without asking any further questions. Consequently, because at that point\nhe believed Wooten\u2019s demand to be real, Mason turned his back to Wooten, obtained a\nbundle of bills, and handed them over. By that time, Wooten had both hands on the\ncounter, leading Mason to believe that Wooten had no intention of reaching for anything.\nAccording to Mason, Wooten \u201cwas not acting like he was going to hurt me or anybody\nin the bank.\u201d In fact, even though Wooten had told Mason that he had a gun, Mason said\nhe \u201cnever felt threatened at all.\u201d Id. at 10.\n\n         After obtaining the money, Wooten exited the bank and drove slowly away.\nPolice stopped him only a few minutes later. Wooten later told investigators that he\nactually wanted to be caught and that he committed the robbery because \u201che was just\ntired of living in his car and he was running out of money.\u201d PSR \u00b6 7, at 5. The record\nalso reflects that Wooten had attempted a similar bank robbery shortly before this one,\nbut left empty handed after the teller at the other bank laughed at him.\n\n         Based on these facts, the district court applied the threat-of-death enhancement\npursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). Initially, the district court emphasized that the\nrelevant standard is an objective one, \u201c[s]o whether or not Mr. Mason was actually in\nfear is not outcome determinative because that would be a subjective standard.\u201d R. 41\n(Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr. at 25). The district court indicated, however, that \u201cwhether Mr.\n\n         1\n           There was some debate at the sentencing hearing concerning whether Wooten said \u201cI have a\ngun\u201d or \u201cI have a weapon.\u201d The teller reported the latter statement in an FBI interview shortly after the\nrobbery, and repeated it in an affidavit filed with the district court. Citing employee training that\nadvocated use of the word \u201cweapon\u201d rather than \u201cgun,\u201d and his recent review of the silent surveillance\nvideo, which purportedly jogged his memory, Mason testified at sentencing that Wooten instead said \u201cI\nhave a gun.\u201d R. 41 (Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr. at 14, 16). The district court found Mason\u2019s later testimony\ncredible in spite of its inconsistency with Mason\u2019s statements in the FBI interview and affidavit. The\ndistrict court therefore made a factual finding that the government had proved by the requisite\npreponderance of the evidence that Wooten said \u201cgun\u201d rather than \u201cweapon.\u201d Although Wooten argues\notherwise, we do not believe this finding constituted clear error. The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard is\ndeferential, and factual findings derived from credibility determinations are entitled to particular deference\nin our court. Satterlee v. Wolfenbarger, 453 F.3d 362, 367 (6th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1281\n(2007). Where, as here, \u201cthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between\nthem cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d Id. at 366\u201367 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore adopt\nthe district court\u2019s findings on this issue.\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v. Wooten                                          Page 4\n\n\nMason was in fear or not certainly is a set of facts that the Court should consider in\ndetermining what a reasonable person would believe.\u201d Id. The district court therefore\nconcluded that \u201cMason\u2019s fear or lack of fear is an important fact to consider in\ndetermining what is reasonable, but it is not controlling.\u201d Id.\n\n       Nonetheless, after recounting Mason\u2019s testimony that Wooten\u2019s demeanor was\n\u201cnonchalant\u201d and that he \u201cnever felt threatened [and] thought [Wooten] was joking,\u201d the\ndistrict court determined that the statement \u201cI have a gun\u201d was enough to constitute a\nthreat of death. Id. at 26. Although the district court did not believe that the same would\nhave been true for the statement \u201cI have a weapon,\u201d it reasoned that \u201cto say I have a gun\nimplies I will use it and implies I will shoot you and implies that if you are shot, you\nmay die and that that is a threat of death.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the district court concluded,\n\u201cthe statement of someone robbing a bank that I have a gun in the overall context of the\nfacts in this case would cause a reasonable person who is a victim of the offense to fear\ndeath.\u201d Id.\n\n       The two-level enhancement resulted in a Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months of\nimprisonment. In considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court found\nWooten\u2019s history and characteristics to be \u201clargely mitigating,\u201d noting Wooten\u2019s military\nhistory, mental-health issues, difficult living circumstances, and nonexistent criminal\nrecord. Id. at 33. Although reiterating the seriousness of a bank robbery offense, the\ndistrict court noted that \u201cthis is Mr. Wooten\u2019s first offense, and he seems remorseful.\u201d\nId. The district court therefore imposed a thirty-seven month prison sentence\u2014the\nbottom of the Guidelines range\u2014and two years of supervised release. On appeal,\nWooten challenges only the district court\u2019s application of the threat-of-death\nenhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\n       We review de novo the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines\nto a particular set of facts, including whether the facts as found warrant the sentencing\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). United States v. Winbush, 296 F.3d 442,\n\fNo. 11-5348         United States v. Wooten                                           Page 5\n\n\n443 (6th Cir. 2002); see also United States v. McCarty, 628 F.3d 284, 289 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\n        Section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) instructs that \u201cif a threat of death was made, increase [the\noffense level] by 2 levels.\u201d To convey a threat of death, an offender must \u201cengage[] in\nconduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, a fear\nof death.\u201d Id. cmt. n.6. By way of example, the Guidelines provide the following\nnonexhaustive list of potential death threats:\n\n        oral or written demand[s] using words such as \u201cGive me the money or I\n        will kill you\u201d, \u201cGive me the money or I will pull the pin on the grenade\n        I have in my pocket\u201d, \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you\u201d, \u201cGive\n        me your money or else (where the defendant draws his hand across his\n        throat in a slashing motion)\u201d, or \u201cGive me the money or you are dead.\u201d\n\nId. As these statements make clear, the threat of death need not be explicit. Id.\nNevertheless, the robber\u2019s communication must be sufficient to permit a reasonable bank\nteller to fear that death is at least a reasonably likely result of his or her noncooperation.\n\n        Although the statement \u201cI have a gun\u201d lacks the type of \u201cor else\u201d condition\npresent in the examples set out above, our cases have determined that the phrase can be\nsufficient on its own to warrant the threat-of-death enhancement. Winbush, 296 F.3d\n442, 443 (6th Cir. 2002). In United States v. Winbush, for example, we upheld a district\ncourt\u2019s application of the enhancement after a bank robber presented a demand note that\nread \u201cTHIS IS A HOLD\u2013UP I HAVE A GUN 100\u2019s 50\u2019s and 20\u2019s,\u201d but did not make\nany oral statements or show the gun during the robbery. Id. at 442. We made a similar\ndetermination in United States v. Clark, 294 F.3d 791, 795 (6th Cir. 2002), which\ninvolved a demand note that read \u201cI have a gun. Do what you are told and you wont\n[sic] get hurt.\u201d There, we found that \u201c[r]eading the two phrases of the note together, the\nclear implication of the message is that failure to cooperate would result in being shot\nthen and there by a gun. This would instill in any reasonable person, such as the teller\nin this case, a fear of death.\u201d Id. Finally, relying on Winbush, we recently stated in\nUnited States v. Moore, 447 F. App\u2019x 721, 723 (6th Cir. 2012) (unpublished opinion),\nthat \u201cadvising a bank employee that one is armed suffices to support the enhancement.\u201d\nThus, we have clearly established that the statement \u201cI have a gun\u201d can constitute a\n\fNo. 11-5348            United States v. Wooten                                                    Page 6\n\n\nthreat of death for purposes of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) enhancement. Other circuits are in\naccordance with this general proposition. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, 602 F.3d\n1156, 1159 (10th Cir. 2010); United States v. Jennings, 439 F.3d 604, 611 (9th Cir.\n2006); United States v. Murphy, 306 F.3d 1087, 1090 (11th Cir. 2002); United States v.\nJennette, 295 F.3d 290, 292\u201393 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1076 (2002); United\nStates v. Gibson, 155 F.3d 844, 845 (7th Cir. 1998).2\n\n         The government argues that these cases\u2014and particularly Winbush\u2014dictate the\noutcome here. Winbush, however, did not establish a per se rule that the statement \u201cI\nhave a gun\u201d always constitutes a threat of death. Instead, Winbush stands only for the\nproposition that, in the absence of mitigating circumstances that erode the typical and\nexpected impact of a bank robber\u2019s announcement that he has a gun, the phrase \u201cI have\na gun,\u201d without more, supports the threat-of-death enhancement. In other words, in\ncases presenting no facts to suggest that the context and circumstances of the robbery\ndulled the threatening implication of the words \u201cI have a gun,\u201d Winbush is the end of the\nanalysis. On the other hand, where potentially mitigating factors are present, the court\nmust go a step further and evaluate the overall circumstances of the robbery to determine\nwhether a reasonable teller in that particular scenario would have perceived a threat of\ndeath. Thus, while the statement \u201cI have a gun\u201d certainly can be enough to support the\nthreat-of-death enhancement\u2014and in the majority of cases it is\u2014the statement is not\nnecessarily enough, especially when contextual circumstances undermine the otherwise\nthreatening nature of the declaration.\n\n         Our interpretation is fully consistent with the plain language of the Sentencing\nGuidelines, which require some analysis of a reasonable victim\u2019s perception of the\nsituation\u2014namely, whether the offender\u2019s overall conduct \u201cwould instill in a reasonable\n\n\n\n         2\n          In light of these precedents, we clearly do not dispute the dissent\u2019s observation that\n\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) applies equally to both express and implied threats of death. To the contrary, we fully\nagree that, at least in the majority of cases, a bank robber\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cI have a gun\u201d is alone\nenough to convey an implicit threat of death that supports the enhancement. As discussed below, it is only\nwhen we are presented with other case-specific contextual factors that this conclusion may vary. Given\nthat none of our prior cases presented any such factors, those cases do not proscribe the distinction we\nmake today for scenarios that present both an implied threat and mitigating contextual factors in the same\ncase.\n\fNo. 11-5348           United States v. Wooten                                                    Page 7\n\n\nperson, who is a victim of the offense, a fear of death.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) cmt.\nn.6. Thus, the sole focus is not the defendant\u2019s choice of words. Instead, as the Third\nCircuit stated, \u201cIn determining whether a threat is a \u2018threat of death,\u2019 the focus is on the\nreasonable response of the victim of the threat.\u201d United States v. Thomas, 327 F.3d 253,\n255 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 974 (2003). That inquiry is one that involves\n\u201csensitivity to fact and context,\u201d Gibson, 155 F.3d at 847, and requires a court to\nconsider the overall circumstances in which the statement occurred, Jennings, 439 F.3d\nat 611.\n\n          Although unusual, one can envision circumstances in which the nature of a\nrobbery makes it objectively unreasonable for a victim of ordinary intelligence to believe\nthat the robber, even if claiming to have a gun, has any intent or ability to carry out a\nviolent act. An offender who walks into a bank waving a banana or what is plainly a toy\ngun, for instance, would not instill a fear of death in a reasonable person, even if the\noffender emphatically announced his possession of a gun. Cf. Jennings, 439 F.3d at 611\n(surmising \u201cthat there could be circumstances that would sufficiently dilute the phrase\n\u2018I have a gun\u2019 so that it would not qualify as a death threat,\u201d such as where \u201ca bank\nrobber claimed to have a gun but brandished what was quite obviously a toy\u201d); Gibson,\n155 F.3d at 847 (stating that \u201cI have a gun,\u201d constitutes a threat of death unless \u201cunusual\nmitigating circumstances accompanying this statement could deprive the words of their\nordinary and expected meaning\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because such\ncircumstances would fall short of instilling a fear of death in a reasonable victim of the\noffense, the threat-of-death enhancement would not be warranted.3\n\n          The question that next arises relates to the types of contextual factors that may\nbe taken into account when determining the likely reaction of such a reasonable victim.\n\n\n\n          3\n            Not one of the cases cited by our dissenting colleague as contrary to our holding contains\nevidence of the type of extenuating facts that we encounter here. Instead, each would have been easily\nresolvable using the more limited analysis in Winbush, and thus, even under our reasoning today, none of\nthe cited cases would have commanded a different result. Our holding is a narrow one, and it is based\nentirely on the unique factual circumstances presented in this case. We express no disagreement with the\nestablished law in either this circuit or our sister circuits. Instead, we merely conclude that this case\nqualifies as one of the rare instances in which the overall context of the robbery prevents the case from\nfitting the standard \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) mold.\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v. Wooten                                          Page 8\n\n\nThis evaluation is clearly an objective one. United States v. Sogan, 388 F. App\u2019x 521,\n524 (6th Cir. 2010) (unpublished opinion). Thus, facts such as the robber\u2019s statements,\nbody language and overall demeanor, tone of voice, and mode of communication are all\nrelevant to the analysis. Moreover, despite the government\u2019s argument to the contrary,\nwe believe that a teller\u2019s reasonable perceptions of an incident also play a role in the\nobjective evaluation of whether a reasonable teller in that specific teller\u2019s shoes would\nhave experienced a fear of death. Cf. id. (discussing two bank tellers\u2019 personal\ninterpretations of the defendant\u2019s statements and expressions of fear when analyzing\nwhether the defendant\u2019s conduct objectively amounted to a threat of death). As the\ndistrict court appropriately recognized, an individual teller\u2019s impression of the events in\nquestion is a relevant consideration for a court trying to determine whether the\nproverbial \u201creasonable person\u201d would have been fearful under the same circumstances.\nAlthough the presence or absence of the teller\u2019s fear is by no means the only factor to\nbe considered\u2014indeed, it cannot be dispositive or even the focus of the analysis\u2014when\nviewed alongside other contextual evidence, such testimony may be useful to\ncorroborate or bolster a court\u2019s broader evaluation of what a reasonable person\u2019s\nresponse would have been under the same circumstances.\n\n       Our conclusion here is consistent with the considerations that we have endorsed\nin a related context: proof of the intimidation element of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2113(a). As is the case with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), the test for intimidation under\n\u00a7 2113(a) is objective, asking \u201cwhether an ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position could\nreasonably infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d United States v.\nGilmore, 282 F.3d 398, 402 (6th Cir. 2002). Applying that standard in a sufficiency-of-\nthe-evidence challenge, we concluded that \u201c[w]hile . . . the test for intimidation is\nessentially an objective one, evidence that the teller felt threatened is probative of\nwhether a reasonable person would have been afraid under the same circumstances.\u201d Id.\nat 403 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the teller\u2019s fear was relevant \u201cin\nassessing the intimidating nature of [the defendant\u2019s] conduct.\u201d Id. The same analysis\napplies here.\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v. Wooten                                          Page 9\n\n\n       Our conclusion is also consistent with the many other circuits that have long\npermitted some consideration of a victim\u2019s perceptions and state of mind in similar\ncontexts that rely on an objective, reasonable-person standard. See, e.g., United States\nv. Davis, 635 F.3d 1222, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (reviewing a district court\u2019s application\nof the sentencing enhancement for brandishing a dangerous weapon and indicating that\nthe victim\u2019s perception \u201cmay be relevant to th[e] inquiry but is never controlling of the\noutcome\u201d (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v.\nAlaboud, 347 F.3d 1293, 1298 (11th Cir. 2003) (citing supporting precedent from other\ncircuits and holding that, even though an objective standard applies to the determination\nwhether a defendant transmitted a threat to injure another in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 875(c), testimony concerning a victim\u2019s personal belief that the defendant\u2019s words\nwere a threat was \u201crelevant in the inquiry of whether a reasonable person would perceive\nthe statements as a threat\u201d); United States v.

As our opinion makes clear,\ntestimony concerning a teller\u2019s personal perceptions may be a consideration in evaluating the broader\nquestion of a reasonable teller\u2019s response, but it cannot be the only consideration. Likewise, such\ntestimony cannot be given undue weight. Moreover, our cases have already condoned the type of\n\u201cterrified-teller testimony,\u201d id., that, by shunning all subjective testimony, the dissent purports to avoid.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gilmore, 282 F.3d 398, 403 (6th Cir. 2002) (permitting testimony from several\ntellers indicating that they personally experienced fear during a bank robbery as proof of the intimidation\nelement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), which employs a similar objective test); United States v. Sogan,\n388 F. App\u2019x 521, 524 (6th Cir. 2010) (unpublished opinion) (noting the tellers\u2019 subjective responses to\nthe robbery when discussing the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) enhancement). Thus,\nby the dissent\u2019s reasoning, in order to ensure that all defendants are treated equally\u2014a proposition with\nwhich we agree\u2014a district court should, in appropriate circumstances, be able to consider testimony from\ntellers who exhibited a nonfearful response.\n          We recognize that an unpublished order in this circuit suggests the opposite conclusion. United\nStates v. Willis, 48 F. App\u2019x 542, 543 (6th Cir. 2002) (unpublished order), involved a robbery during which\na robber gave a bank teller a demand note that stated: \u201cThere is a gun pointed at your head. Put the money\nin the bag. 20 minutes after I\u2019m gone the guy with the gun will also leave. Try anything funny, you will\nbe shot.\u201d Apparently unconvinced, the teller refused to cooperate. Id. At sentencing, the defendant\nattempted to argue that the noncooperation demonstrated that the teller never feared for her life and that\nthe threat-of-death enhancement therefore should not apply. We rejected that argument, and in doing so,\nnoted that \u201c[t]he subjective belief or reaction of the teller to the demand note has no relevance to the\n[\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F)] analysis.\u201d Id. We think our approach today is the better one. And because Willis was\nunpublished, we are not bound by its reasoning. United States v. Dial, 524 F.3d 783, 787 n.2 (6th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 555 U.S. 902 (2008). Moreover, Willis did not confront the more compelling circumstances\nnow present before us. Instead, Willis involved a more direct personal threat and the use of a demand note,\nwhich may reasonably indicate a more seasoned robber. Thus, even if it had been considered, the scant\nmitigation evidence to which the defense pointed in Willis would not have outweighed the usual impact\nof the defendant\u2019s threatening words.\n          In addition, although we believe that our approach is entirely consistent with the Sentencing\nGuidelines, given that there is some division between the circuits with respect to the contextual factors that\nmay be considered when determining whether a defendant made a threat of death for purposes of\n\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), we do not think that the Sentencing Commission would be remiss to provide additional\nclarification on this issue. Cf. Jansen v. United States, 369 F.3d 237, 250 (3d Cir. 2004) (Alito, J.,\nconcurring) (requesting that the Sentencing Commission address an ambiguous Guideline provision that\nhad been the subject of a circuit split).\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v. Wooten                                      Page 11\n\n\napplication of the threat-of-death enhancement. A number of factors support this\ndetermination.   First, Mason\u2019s description of Wooten\u2019s nonaggressive demeanor\nsuggests that Wooten would not have appeared threatening to a reasonable observer.\nWooten approached the tellers calmly, placed both hands in a visible position on the\ncounter, and softly said that he was engaged in a robbery. Wooten\u2019s demeanor was\ndescribed as \u201cnonthreatening,\u201d and Wooten was not engaged in any conduct that would\nobjectively suggest an intent to \u201churt [Mason] or anyone in the bank.\u201d R. 41 (Sentencing\nHr\u2019g Tr. at 9). Such behavior would not convey to a reasonable teller in Mason\u2019s\nposition that Wooten was prepared to use deadly force.\n\n       Second, the robbery did not contain any hallmarks of experienced bank robbers,\nsuch as demand notes, which may contribute to the intimidating nature of an encounter.\nCf. United States v. Pacheco, 466 F. App\u2019x 517, 523 (6th Cir. 2012) (unpublished\nopinion) (\u201cA demand note itself, being a tool of the trade of bank robbers, is a form of\nintimidation.\u201d (quoting United States v. Smith, No. 92-6311, 1993 WL 303359, at *1\n(6th Cir. Aug. 9, 1993)). Wooten wore no mask or disguise and appeared no different\nthan an ordinary customer. By all accounts, Wooten did not assertively command that\nMason hand over the money. Instead, Wooten rather amateurishly made repeated but\nquiet demands in an attempt to convince Mason that he was truly engaged in a robbery.\nThus, these facts also support the conclusion that Wooten\u2019s conduct was not objectively\nthreatening.\n\n       Finally, Mason himself testified both at sentencing and in an affidavit that he\nnever felt threatened by Wooten. Instead, Mason explained that he handed over the\nmoney because he had been trained to do so if he were ever presented with a robbery\ndemand, not because of any perceived danger. Based on the unchallenged description\nof the robbery, Mason\u2019s response does not appear to be that of an unusually fearless\nindividual, and instead corroborates the objective descriptions of Wooten\u2019s conduct.\nThat a teller at a separate unsuccessful bank robbery laughed at Wooten\u2019s prior similar\nattempt further supports Mason\u2019s assessment of Wooten\u2019s conduct and demeanor, as\nwell as Mason\u2019s resulting belief that he was never in harm\u2019s way. Like Mason, that\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v. Wooten                                       Page 12\n\n\nearlier teller did not discern any real threat. Thus, taken as a whole, the overall\ncircumstances were sufficient to mitigate the force of Wooten\u2019s assertion that he had a\ngun, and Wooten\u2019s conduct falls short of warranting the threat-of-death enhancement\nunder \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n       We recognize that, in most cases, a bank teller\u2019s recollection of the circumstances\nof a robbery will not be as favorable to a defendant as it is to Wooten here. Indeed, in\nsome instances, such testimony may in fact work against a defendant seeking to avoid\nthe two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). Nevertheless, under the particular\ncircumstances of this case, Mason\u2019s reasonable perceptions, in combination with the\nother characteristics of Wooten\u2019s offense conduct, objectively lead to the conclusion that\na reasonable teller in Mason\u2019s shoes would not have perceived a threat of death.\nAccordingly, because the district court erred in finding that Wooten had made a threat\nof death within the meaning of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), we REVERSE the district court\u2019s\nimposition of the threat-of-death enhancement, VACATE Wooten\u2019s sentence, and\nREMAND for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v.

I can think of just one reason why a bank\nrobber would tell a bank teller he has a gun: to show he means business. That is what\nJames Wooten did. On September 23, 2010, Wooten went to the Green Bank in\nGordonsville, Tennessee to rob it. The bank teller did not take him seriously when he\ntwice said, \u201cI am going to rob you.\u201d So Wooten upped the ante: \u201cI have a gun. Give\nme your money.\u201d R. 41 at 5. The teller, no surprise, now took him seriously\u2014and\ncomplied. The reason the threat worked, the reason Wooten gave it, is that it conveys\nan unmistakable message: hand over the money or I will shoot you\u2014point blank with\nonly the upper half of your body as a target. Because this message amounts to a \u201cthreat\nof death,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a72B3.1(b)(2)(F), the district court permissibly applied the two-level\nsentencing enhancement.\n\n       The enhancement applies when the robber \u201cengage[s] in conduct that would\ninstill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, a fear of death.\u201d U.S.S.G.\n\u00a7 2B3.1 cmt. n.6; United States v. Clark, 294 F.3d 791, 795 (6th Cir. 2002). As an\nillustration, the guideline commentary says that the statement, \u201cGive me the money or\nI will shoot you,\u201d qualifies as a threat of death. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 cmt. n.6. Wooten, true\nenough, did not expressly say that. He demanded money and informed the teller he had\na gun, leaving the implication \u201cor I will shoot you\u201d unsaid. But what reasonable person\nwould take comfort in the difference between the two statements?\n\n       That is all the more true when we remember that the relevant guideline used to\nrequire an \u201cexpress threat of death\u201d to trigger the enhancement and the commentary\nlisted \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you\u201d as an example of an express threat.\nUnited States v. Alexander, 88 F.3d 427, 428 (6th Cir. 1996) (emphasis added) (quoting\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) (1994)). The Sentencing Commission deleted \u201cexpress\u201d from\nthe guideline in 1997 and clarified that \u201cthe defendant does not have to state expressly\nhis intent to kill the victim,\u201d all of which establishes that an implied threat will do.\n\fNo. 11-5348          United States v. Wooten                                      Page 14\n\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 cmt. n.6. If \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you\u201d qualifies as an\nexpress threat of death, then surely \u201cI have a gun. Give me your money\u201d constitutes an\nimplied threat of death. That is just what happened.\n\n       Until today, all of our cases were in alignment on this point. We have applied\nthe threat-of-death enhancement to bank robbers who made threats just like the one\nWooten made. In one case, the bank robber passed the teller a note saying, \u201cTHIS IS A\nHOLD-UP I HAVE A GUN 100's 50's and 20's.\u201d United States v. Winbush, 296 F.3d\n442, 442 (6th Cir. 2002). If the enhancement covered that threat, as we held it did, it\nsurely covers this one, as there is no material difference between the two. In another\ncase, we applied the enhancement to a bank robber who passed the teller a note saying,\n\u201cI have a gun. Do what you are told and you won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d United States v. Clark,\n294 F.3d 791, 795 (6th Cir. 2002). The language in each of these notes, we held, would\n\u201cinstill in any reasonable person\u201d a fear of death. Winbush, 296 F.3d at 443; Clark,\n294 F.3d at 795. The same is true of other cases. See United States v. Moore, 447 F.\nApp\u2019x 721, 723 (6th Cir. 2012) (upholding application of enhancement where bank\nrobber passed teller a note saying, \u201cI have a gun. Give me the cash\u201d); United States v.\nSogan, 388 F. App\u2019x 521, 523 (6th Cir. 2010) (upholding application of enhancement\nwhere defendant told tellers to \u201cgive me your money\u201d and placed his hand on his waist,\nimplying he had a gun). If these cases were correctly decided, I do not understand how\nthis one could be.\n\n       Shift the focus to the other circuits in the country, and you will not find a single\ndance partner for today\u2019s decision. Until today, every bank robber who appealed a\nthreat-of-death enhancement after saying \u201cI have a gun\u201d (or words to that effect) has lost\nunder the current version of the guideline.\n\n       Here are the published cases.

Give me the Cash, I\u2019ve got a\ngun.\u201d).\n\n          Best I can tell, no case from any circuit, published or unpublished, has reversed\na threat-of-death enhancement applied to a bank robber who told the teller he had a gun\nunder the current version of the guideline. What if anything makes James Wooten\u2019s case\nso unusual? What distinguishes his conduct from the legions of bank robbers who made\nsimilar threats and received a threat-of-death enhancement?\n\n          Three things, says the majority. First, \u201cthe robbery did not contain any hallmarks\nof experienced bank robbers, such as demand notes\u201d or a \u201cmask or disguise.\u201d But the\nsource of the idea that \u201cexperienced bank robbers\u201d use demand notes and masks and the\nrest are less-dangerous neophytes is a mystery. John Dillinger did not use demand notes\nor wear a mask. See Dary Materia, John Dillinger: The Life and Death of America\u2019s\nFirst Celebrity Criminal 47 (2004). Neither did Bonnie Parker or Clyde Barrow. See\nE.R. Milner, The Lives and Times of Bonnie and Clyde 114\u201315 (1996). While Willie\nSutton (no relation) sometimes wore disguises\u2014dressing up as a policeman, as a\npostman, even as a window cleaner\u2014he apparently did not use demand notes. See\nGangsters, Swindlers, Killers, and Thieves: The Lives and Crimes of Fifty American\nVillains 218 (Lawrence Block, ed., 2004). Yet these bank robbers all qualified as\nexperienced\u2014and dangerous.\n\fNo. 11-5348        United States v. Wooten                                        Page 18\n\n\n       Second, Wooten exhibited a \u201cnonaggressive demeanor\u201d during the robbery,\n\u201capproach[ing] the tellers calmly, plac[ing] both hands in a visible position on the\ncounter, and softly sa[ying] that he was engaged in robbery.\u201d So what. Not all bank\nrobbers scream and yell, drawing attention to themselves in the process. That was not\nWillie Sutton\u2019s style. See id. And not all people who speak softly are unarmed and\nunwilling, as one of our Presidents liked to imply. Keeping a low profile at all events\nis not a bad idea if the robber wishes to make a successful escape.\n\n       Nor, it seems to me, is the demeanor of people who threaten others by saying \u201cI\nhave a gun\u201d usually relevant to this kind of crime or any other. If a passenger on an\nairplane says, \u201cI have a gun. Let me into the cockpit,\u201d should an air marshal stop and\nconsider the prospective terrorist\u2019s demeanor, tone of voice and hand placement before\ntaking action? What about a student who says \u201cI have a gun\u201d in school? Should the\nprincipal undertake the same detailed analysis before calling the police? In bank\nrobberies, as in other settings, the threat \u201cI have a gun\u201d is more than enough to prompt\npeople to act out of reasonable fear for their lives and the lives of others.\n\n       Third, the bank teller testified that he did not feel threatened by Wooten. Supra\nat 12. This is the least relevant, and the most dangerous, of rationales. The relevant\ninquiry is an objective one: Would the robber\u2019s conduct instill a fear of death in a\n\u201creasonable person\u201d? U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 cmt. n.6; Clark, 294 F.3d at 795. The point of\nan objective inquiry is to make a subjective one beside the point. See Whren v. United\nStates, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996). The question is what the defendant did, not how a\nrange of victims\u2014meek, brazen, indifferent\u2014reacted to what he did. One teller might\nfaint in response to an I-have-a-gun bank robbery and another might respond by saying\n\u201cMake my day.\u201d The guideline requires an enhancement in both settings, not one of\nthem. Even if subjective impressions somehow mattered, it surely should be the job of\nthe district judge, who saw the teller testify about the encounter, to assess the impact of\nthe testimony, not us, who have only a cold transcript to work with. See United States\nv. Poynter, 495 F.3d 349, 351\u201352 (6th Cir. 2007). Notably, every one of the majority\u2019s\n\fNo. 11-5348         United States v. Wooten                                         Page 19\n\n\ncitations on this point\u2014not one of which concerns the threat-of-death\nenhancement\u2014involves subjective impressions that supported the fact-finder\u2019s decision.\n\n        This inquiry also is a perilous one. Do we really want to make the testimony of\nvictims of crime relevant to questions about whether the conduct of criminal defendants\nwould objectively instill fear? I have a strong suspicion that this inquiry will do far more\nharm than good to defendants seeking even-handed and fair-minded sentencing hearings\nin the future. What of the robber who demands money but does not say he has a gun?\nCould a bank teller nonetheless testify, not implausibly, that she saw her life pass before\nher eyes during the robbery? Could a sentencing court rely on this testimony in applying\nthe enhancement? I think not, and I hope not. But the majority\u2019s decision, denying the\nenhancement based on fearless-teller testimony, surely permits just such a\nsentencing increase, granting the enhancement based on terrified-teller testimony.\nBoth enhancements are permitted or neither is.\n\n        I do not doubt that there are some cases where the objective contextual factors\nsurrounding the threat detract from a reasonable fear of death. A would-be robber who\nsays he has a gun but brandishes \u201ca banana,\u201d supra at 7, or wields \u201cwhat [is] quite\nobviously a toy,\u201d United States v. Jennings, 439 F.3d 604, 611 (9th Cir. 2006), will not\nwarrant the enhancement. See United States v. Gibson, 155 F.3d 844, 847 (7th Cir.\n1998). But no circuit has seen such a case, and there is a good reason why: No self-\nrespecting prosecutor would ask for such an enhancement.\n\n        In the final analysis, I see nothing in Wooten\u2019s actions that distinguishes this case\nfrom our prior published decisions, Winbush, 296 F.3d at 443; Clark, 294 F.3d at 795,\nor for that matter from the legion of decisions from other circuits upholding application\nof the enhancement based on similar threats. The majority seeing things differently, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\f",
