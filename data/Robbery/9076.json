He appeals both his\nconviction and sentence.\n      Briseno maintains the district court erred by imposing a 16-level, crime-of-\nviolence increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), based on his prior Texas\nconviction for burglary of a habitation. Although post-Booker, the Sentencing\n\n\n\n      *\n      Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion\nshould not be published and is not precedent except under the limited\ncircumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                                   No. 07-40554\n\nGuidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for\nreasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must\nstill properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the\nsentence to impose. Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 596 (2007). In that\nrespect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed de novo; its factual findings,\nonly for clear error. E.g., United States v. Villegas, 404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.\n2005).\n      Briseno asserts the definition of habitation under Texas law is broader\nthan the generic, contemporary meaning of dwelling as used in the enumerated\noffense of burglary of a dwelling in the Sentencing Guidelines. Although he\nacknowledges this court\u2019s precedent to the contrary, Briseno asserts it has been\noverruled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in James v. United States, 127 S. Ct.\n1586, 1599-1600 (2007). This contention is without merit; James did not involve\nan enumerated offense. See United States v. Gomez-Guerra, 485 F.3d 301, 303\n& n.1 (5th Cir. 2007). As a result, the district court did not err in determining\nthat Briseno\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence. See United States v.\nValdez-Maltos, 443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 265 (2006).\n      In the light of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), Briseno\nchallenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and\naggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the\noffense that must be found by a jury.           This argument is foreclosed by\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 235 (1998). United States v.\nPineda-Arrellano, 492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 872\n(2008).\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f",
