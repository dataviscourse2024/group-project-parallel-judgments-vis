There is no basis for disturbing the court\u2019s determinations concerning credibility (see People v *198Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 94 [1903]). Appellant\u2019s course of conduct established that he was a participant in an attempt to forcibly steal a bicycle, and was not consistent with a theory that he was merely attempting to recover a bicycle allegedly stolen by the complainants from a third party. In particular, appellant ignored a warning from an adult bystander that the bicycle belonged to the complainants, and fled, accompanying the other participants in the crime, upon the approach of the police. We have considered and rejected appellant\u2019s remaining claims. Concur\u2014 Mazzarelli, J.E, Ellerin, Nardelli, Gonzalez and Catterson, JJ.\n",
