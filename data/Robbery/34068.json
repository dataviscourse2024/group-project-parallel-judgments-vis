Appellant\u2019s participation was amply established by the complainant\u2019s testimony that he saw appellant, moments after the crime, exiting the adjacent building with several individu*135ais, one of whom the complainant had seen in his apartment, and that immediately thereafter he saw the police recover part of his property from each member of a group of three persons that included appellant (see, People v Davis, 213 AD2d 289, lv denied 85 NY2d 937).\nAs the presentment agency correctly concedes, the crimes of burglary in the third degree, criminal trespass in the second degree, and criminal trespass in the third degree are all lesser included offenses of burglary in the second degree, so that these charges should be dismissed (CPL 300.40 [3] [b]).
