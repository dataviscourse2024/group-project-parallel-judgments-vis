MURPHY OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\nMICHAEL J. FLAHERTY, JR., ACTING DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BUFFALO (ASHLEY R.\nLOWRY OF COUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n     Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Erie County (Russell\nP. Buscaglia, A.J.), rendered February 25, 2013. The judgment\nconvicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of burglary in the\nsecond degree.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is\nunanimously affirmed.\n\n     Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him,\nupon his plea of guilty, of burglary in the second degree (Penal Law\n\u00a7 140.25 [2]). Supreme Court sentenced defendant as a second violent\nfelony offender to nine years of imprisonment to be followed by five\nyears of postrelease supervision.\n\n     Defendant contends that he was denied effective assistance of\ncounsel during the pre-indictment plea negotiations on the grounds\nthat defense counsel allegedly failed to provide meaningful\nrepresentation in properly advising defendant with respect to whether\nhe should accept or reject the offer, and that defense counsel failed\nto inform him that the pre-indictment plea offer was about to expire.\nThat contention \u201csurvives his guilty plea only insofar as he contends\nthat his plea was infected by the allegedly ineffective assistance and\nthat he entered the plea because of his attorney\u2019s allegedly poor\nperformance\u201d (People v Bethune, 21 AD3d 1316, 1316, lv denied 6 NY3d\n752; see People v Petgen, 55 NY2d 529, 534-535, rearg denied 57 NY2d\n674). Here, defendant failed to make a showing that he entered his\nplea because of his attorney\u2019s allegedly poor performance.\nFurthermore, to the extent that defendant\u2019s contention survives his\nguilty plea, we conclude that it lacks merit (see People v Rockwell,\n137 AD3d 1586, 1587; cf. People v Abdulla, 98 AD3d 1253, 1254, lv\ndenied 20 NY3d 985). The record, including the testimony from the\nhearing on defendant\u2019s motion to reinstate a prior plea offer,\n\f                                 -2-                          1027\n                                                         KA 14-01324\n\nestablishes that defendant \u201creceived \u2018an advantageous plea and nothing\nin the record casts doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel\u2019 \u201d\n(People v Hoyer, 119 AD3d 1457, 1458).\n\n     Defendant also contends that the court erred in refusing to\nsuppress a photo array identification of him by a witness based upon\nan alleged irregularity in the way the array was compiled. We reject\nthat contention. \u201cThe test to be used in determining the propriety of\npretrial identification is one of fairness . . . based upon the\ntotality of the surrounding circumstances\u201d (People v Hoyer, 141 AD2d\n973, 974, lv denied 72 NY2d 1046). Here, the People established both\nthe reasonableness of the police conduct in using the vehicle\nidentified in connection with the burglary to identify defendant, and\nthen using his physical characteristics as obtained through a prior\nbooking photo to compile the array, as well as the lack of any undue\nsuggestiveness in the photo array procedure, and defendant failed to\nmeet his burden of proving that the procedure was unreasonable or\nunduly suggestive (see People v Chipp, 75 NY2d 327, 335-336).\n\n     Finally, we conclude that defendant\u2019s sentence is not unduly\nharsh or severe.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   December 23, 2016                    Frances E.
