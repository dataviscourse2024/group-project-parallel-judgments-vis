HERMAN, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               This is a will contest consolidated with a suit to set aside certain trust amendments\n\nand inter vivos deeds. Appellees Donald and Donnie Bonham challenged their grandmother\n\nDolly Bonham\u2019s capacity to execute the will at issue, amend an existing trust document, and\n\ntransfer certain real property, each of which resulted in property that would otherwise have gone to\n\nappellees going instead to appellant Mary Dildine (Dolly\u2019s daughter and appellees\u2019 aunt) as well as\n\nappellants Rhonda Adrian and Michelle Dunlap (Mary\u2019s two daughters). The probate court held\n\nthat Dolly Bonham lacked the requisite capacity during the time period in which the disputed\n\ndocuments were executed and, therefore, that those documents were invalid and of no force or effect.\n\nIn addition, the court removed Mary Dildine and Rhonda Adrian as trustees of the trusts at issue\n\nbased on its finding of good cause to do so. The court denied Mary Dildine\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019\n\ffees based on its finding that she did not prosecute her application to probate the will in good faith\n\nor with just cause. On appeal, appellants challenge each of these actions by the probate court. We\n\naffirm the probate court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\nFactual and Procedural Background\n\n               Elbert and Dolly Bonham had two children, Freddie Bonham and appellant\n\nMary Dildine, each of whom also had two children.             Mary had two daughters, appellants\n\nRhonda Adrian and Michelle Dunlap. Freddie had two sons, appellees Donald and Donnie Bonham.\n\nFreddie died in 1991.\n\n               In 1995, Elbert and Dolly executed a will (the \u201c1995 Will\u201d) and created and funded\n\nthe Bonham Family Trust. In accordance with a history of Elbert and Dolly treating their children\n\nFreddie Bonham and Mary Dildine relatively equally, under the terms of the 1995 Will and original\n\ntrust Mary was to receive a 363-acre tract of ranch land, Freddie\u2019s sons Donald and Donnie were to\n\nreceive the 292-acre ranch in Dripping Springs on which Elbert and Dolly\u2019s residence was located,\n\nand the remainder of the trust estate was to be divided 50% to Mary and 25% each to Donald\n\nand Donnie. In 1996, the 363-acre property was gift deeded to Mary, and the trust was amended in\n\nAugust 1997 to remove that property from the trust corpus. Also under the 1997 amendment, Mary\u2019s\n\nshare of the residual was reduced from 50% to 30%, and her daughters Rhonda and Michelle\n\nwere each given a 10% share. In June 2001, the trust was amended a second time to change the\n\nsuccessor trustees\u2014in the event both Elbert and Dolly ceased serving as trustee\u2014to Mary, Rhonda,\n\nDonald, and Donnie.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f               In November 2000, Dolly suffered a stroke, which resulted in aphasia (speech\n\ndifficulties) and some physical control problems. The parties dispute the stroke\u2019s impact on Dolly\u2019s\n\ncognitive abilities. For the sake of Dolly\u2019s care, in March 2001 Elbert and Dolly moved from their\n\nhouse on the 292-acre ranch into Carestone, an assisted living facility, while Donald and his wife\n\nTeresa remained on the ranch property living in a mobile home. In July 2002, Elbert suffered a\n\nstroke. Following Elbert\u2019s stroke, in September 2002 Elbert and Dolly moved from the assisted\n\nliving facility into Hill Country Care, a nursing home.\n\n               Elbert died on February 5, 2003. Upon Elbert\u2019s death the Bonham Family Trust,\n\npursuant to its terms, was divided into three parts: Trust A, a revocable survivor\u2019s trust holding\n\nDolly\u2019s separate property and one-half interest in the community property; Trust M, an irrevocable\n\ntrust holding property for the purpose of the payment of taxes; and Trust B, an irrevocable bypass\n\ntrust holding the balance of the assets. At the time of Elbert\u2019s death, under the terms of the 1995\n\nWill and Trusts A and B as amended, Donald and Donnie Bonham were to receive the entire 292-\n\nacre ranch together with half of the residuary and composed half of the four successor trustees.\n\n               After Elbert\u2019s death, Dolly Bonham executed documents that had the effect of\n\nreducing the property to be received by Donald and Donnie. On November 13, 2003, Dolly executed\n\na \u201cThird Amendment\u201d to Trust A, appointing Dolly or Mary as trustees, and Mary\u2019s husband\n\nCharles Dildine and their daughter Rhonda as the successor trustees. Contemporaneously with this\n\namendment, Mary executed a new will (the \u201c2003 Will\u201d) leaving her personal and household effects\n\nand the residuary of Trust A to Mary, Rhonda, and Michelle. In early 2004, Dolly initiated partition\n\nof the 292-acre ranch into five tracts, identified in this lawsuit as Tracts A, B, C, D, and E. Having\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fencountered surveyors on the ranch and learning of the planned partition, Donald and Donnie filed\n\nsuit against Dolly and Mary in March 2004 to enjoin any partitioning or gifting of the ranch, alleging\n\nthat Dolly was incompetent to do so. On October 5, 2004, Dolly executed a \u201cFourth Amendment\u201d\n\nto Trust A, whereby 50% of the 292-acre property would be divided equally between Michelle\n\nand Rhonda (Donald and Donnie remained entitled to a portion of the property as a result of the\n\nirrevocable Trust B), and the remainder of the trust estate would pass 60% to Mary, 20% to Michelle,\n\nand 20% to Rhonda. On January 25, 2005, Dolly executed Special Warranty Deeds (the \u201c2005\n\nDeeds\u201d) conveying Tract A to Rhonda, Tract D to Michelle, Tracts B and C to Trust B (for the\n\nbenefit of Donald and Donnie), and Tract E to Trust A (by which, according to testimony at trial,\n\nDolly could obtain additional income if necessary). On May 16, 2005, while Donald and Donnie\u2019s\n\nlawsuit was pending, Dolly died.\n\n               Mary Dildine filed an application for appointment as independent executor of the\n\nEstate of Dolly Bonham. Donald and Donnie Bonham filed a will contest, and sought declaratory\n\nrelief that the 2003 Will, the Third and Fourth Amendments, and the 2005 Deeds were invalid. The\n\nBonham brothers alleged that Dolly lacked capacity to enter into the transactions, that Dolly was\n\nunduly influenced by Mary, and that Dolly was suffering from a delusional state at the times\n\nthe instruments were executed. Mary asserted a counterclaim for declaratory relief that the 2005\n\nDeeds were valid distributions and sought attorneys\u2019 fees for defending the 2003 Will. Following\n\na bench trial, the probate court found that Dolly lacked testamentary capacity, contractual capacity,\n\nand capacity to formulate an intent to make a gift \u201cat all times from the year 2002 until her death\n\non May 16, 2005.\u201d The court declared the 2003 Will, the Third and Fourth Amendments to the\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fBonham Family Trust, and the 2005 Deeds invalid and of no force or effect, and denied Mary\u2019s\n\napplication to probate the 2003 Will. The probate court also removed Mary and Rhonda as trustees\n\nof the Bonham Family Trust and denied Mary\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. Mary Dildine and her\n\ndaughters Michelle and Rhonda appeal the judgment.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n                Appellants present three points on appeal: (1) the evidence is legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Dolly Bonham lacked capacity; (2) the evidence\n\nis legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding of good cause for removal of\n\nMary and Rhonda as trustees; and (3) there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that\n\nMary failed to prosecute her application to probate the will in good faith or with just cause, on which\n\nfinding the court based its denial of Mary\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees out of the estate.\n\n\n        Dolly Bonham\u2019s Capacity\n\n                In their first point on appeal, appellants assert that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Dolly Bonham lacked testamentary,\n\ncontractual, and intent-to-gift capacity from the year 2002 until her death in 2005. Testamentary\n\ncapacity requires that the testatrix, at the time of execution of the will, have sufficient mental ability\n\nto understand she is making a will, the effect of making the will, and the general nature and extent\n\nof her property, know her next of kin and the natural objects of her bounty, and have sufficient\n\nmemory to collect in her mind the elements of the business transacted and hold them long enough\n\nto perceive their obvious relation to each other and form a reasonable judgment about them. See\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fLong v. Long, 196 S.W.3d 460, 464 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2006, no pet.); In re Estate of Grimm,\n\n180 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2005, no pet.). Appellants, as proponents of the\n\n2003 Will, have the burden of proving Dolly\u2019s testamentary capacity. See Croucher v. Croucher,\n\n660 S.W.2d 55, 57 (Tex. 1983); Long, 196 S.W.3d at 464. To establish mental capacity to execute\n\na deed or contract, the grantor at the time of execution must have had sufficient mind and memory\n\nto understand the nature and effect of her act. See Decker v. Decker, 192 S.W.3d 648, 652\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2006, no pet.). With respect to Dolly\u2019s contractual capacity, the burden of\n\nproof rests on the Bonham brothers, as the parties seeking to set aside the deeds and trust\n\namendments based on the grantor Dolly\u2019s lack of mental capacity. See id. at 652.\n\n               For a legal sufficiency challenge, we review the evidence in the light favorable to the\n\nverdict, crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could and disregarding contrary evidence\n\nunless reasonable jurors could not. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807 (Tex. 2005). In\n\nreviewing appellants\u2019 legal sufficiency challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding of lack of capacity to\n\nexecute the 2003 Will\u2014an issue for which appellants had the burden of proof\u2014we will sustain their\n\npoint on appeal based on the legal sufficiency of the evidence only if the evidence conclusively\n\nestablishes, as a matter of law, that Dolly had capacity. See Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d\n\n237, 241 (Tex. 2001). The test is whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-\n\nminded people to reach the verdict under review. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827. In reviewing\n\nappellants\u2019 legal sufficiency challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding of lack of capacity to execute the\n\nThird and Fourth Amendments and the 2005 Deeds\u2014an issue for which the Bonham brothers had\n\nthe burden of proof\u2014we will sustain appellants\u2019 complaint if the record reveals (1) the complete\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fabsence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight to\n\nthe only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no\n\nmore than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact.\n\nSee id. at 810. More than a scintilla of evidence exists if the evidence rises to a level that would\n\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions. Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway,\n\n135 S.W.3d 598, 601 (Tex. 2004).\n\n                For a factual sufficiency challenge, we must consider and weigh all the evidence\n\nin the record, both supporting and against the finding, to decide whether the verdict should be set\n\naside. Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 242. In reviewing appellants\u2019 factual sufficiency challenge\n\nto the trial court\u2019s finding of lack of capacity, we will set aside the judgment only if the finding is\n\nso against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Id.;\n\nCain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).\n\n                The Bonham brothers introduced into evidence Dolly\u2019s medical records from the time\n\nof her stays at Carestone and Hill Country Care, and their expert witness Dr. Jaron Winston\u2014board\n\ncertified in general psychiatry and geriatric psychiatry\u2014testified concerning his assessment of\n\nthose medical records. Dr. Winston\u2019s testimony addressed the records of Dr. Gordon Sixty, a\n\nclinical psychologist who met regularly with Dolly at Hill Country Care, and Dr. Mark Dawson,\n\nDolly\u2019s attending physician. According to Dr. Winston, Dr. Sixty\u2019s notation following his initial\n\nconsultation with Dolly in December 2002 of \u201cprobable frontal lobe impairment\u201d with decreased\n\ndecision-making, reasoning, and judgment, his progress notes from December 2002 through\n\nApril 2005, the \u201cMini-Mental State Examination\u201d results administered by Dr. Sixty in 2002 and\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\f2004, and his recommended prescriptions together showed that Dolly experienced a decrease in\n\nmental functioning and cognitive reasoning abilities resulting from her stroke in 2000. Dr. Winston\n\nfound Dr. Sixty\u2019s initial diagnosis in 2002 of Dolly\u2019s conditions that included \u201cVascular\n\nDementia\u201d\u2014and Dr. Dawson\u2019s prescription for medication based on that diagnosis\u2014to be consistent\n\nwith this finding. The \u201cphysician\u2019s orders,\u201d which were signed by Dr. Dawson, beginning in\n\nOctober 2002 stated that Dolly was \u201cincapable of understanding/exercising rights\u201d and, therefore,\n\nher daughter Mary Dildine would be required to give consent for medical procedures. Dr. Winston\n\nidentified further evidence of Dolly\u2019s decreased cognitive abilities in the Hill Country Care nurses\u2019\n\nnotes, Dolly\u2019s treatment care plan for therapy staff from 2003, her rehabilitation therapy notes\n\nfrom late 2004, and monthly nursing summaries from late 2003 through early 2005. Based on\n\nthese medical records, Dr. Winston concluded that from 2002 through 2005 Dolly did not have\n\ntestamentary or contractual capacity.1\n\n                In response, appellants rely on multiple witnesses who testified to Dolly\u2019s capacity\n\nbased on their personal experiences and observations, including appellants Mary and Rhonda;\n\nDr. Dawson; Jim Dunlap and his daughter Michele Dunlap,2 the estate planning attorneys who\n\n\n\n       1\n            Appellants argue that Dr. Winston\u2019s testimony does not support the trial court\u2019s\nfinding of a lack of testamentary capacity because he did not testify as to the specific date at\nissue\u2014November 13, 2003. See Lee v. Lee, 424 S.W.2d 609, 611 (Tex. 1968) (proper inquiry on\nissue of testamentary capacity is the condition of the testator\u2019s mind on the day will was executed).\nHowever, a testatrix\u2019s conduct on dates prior or subsequent to a will\u2019s execution has \u201cprobative\nforce\u201d if the evidence demonstrates the condition persists and has some probability of being the\nsame condition that existed at the time of the will\u2019s execution. See id. Dr. Winston testified that\nthe medical records were evidence that Dolly\u2019s incapacity was continuous through the time of the\n2003 Will\u2019s execution.\n       2\n           The Dunlap witnesses are not related to appellant Michelle Dunlap.\n\n                                                 8\n\fprepared the 2003 Will and Third and Fourth Amendments; Allen Herrington, the attorney who\n\nprepared the 2005 Deeds and represented Dolly and Mary in the 2004 lawsuit filed by the Bonham\n\nbrothers; Nelson Davidson, a family friend and attorney who prepared a tax form for Dolly in\n\nApril 2004; Laura Booth, an employee of Hill Country Care who interacted socially with Dolly;\n\nand Reverend John McCullough, Dolly\u2019s pastor, who made social visits to her once or twice a\n\nmonth after Elbert died. Appellants argue that these witnesses\u2019 \u201ccopious testimony\u201d overcomes\n\nDr. Winston\u2019s reliance on \u201cselected examples\u201d from Dolly\u2019s medical records.\n\n               However, Dr. Winston testified that evidence of Dolly\u2019s social functioning was not\n\ninconsistent with his conclusions of cognitive deterioration and incapacity, as some functions that\n\nhad been engrained would take a longer time to be lost. He noted that while Dolly\u2019s speech and daily\n\nactivities might have improved from her initial condition following her stroke, the medical records\n\nindicated that her cognitive skills continued to deteriorate. Moreover, Donald, his wife Teresa, and\n\nDonnie each testified regarding their own observations that indicated Dolly lacked capacity,\n\nincluding her forgetting Donald\u2019s relationship to the 292-acre ranch property in 2002 and her failure\n\nto recognize Donnie toward the end of her life.3\n\n\n       3\n          In addition, there was evidence suggesting that some of appellants\u2019 witnesses\u2019 recollections\nwere not entirely reliable. For instance, after repeatedly affirming Dolly\u2019s capacity as of the date\nDolly executed the 2003 Will and Third Amendment, on cross examination Michele Dunlap\nadmitted that her testimony was based not on her actual recollection of events, but on her standard\noffice practices. Jim Dunlap denied ever having met or spoken with the Bonham brothers,\nbut Donald testified to a meeting between them in Dunlap\u2019s office and introduced into evidence\na cancelled check representing payment for legal advice received. Although Dr. Dawson testified\nthat he never had any reason to think Dolly was disoriented, he also admitted approving medications\nbased on Dr. Sixty\u2019s diagnoses and that he would have no reason to disagree with the medical record\nin the event it demonstrated a deterioration of Dolly\u2019s cognitive function and reasoning ability.\nMary Dildine denied any knowledge of her mother\u2019s sleeping difficulty, anxiety, and depression\n\n                                                   9\n\f                The testimony as to Dolly Bonham\u2019s capacity is conflicting and disputed. The\n\ntrial court heard the witnesses and had the opportunity to observe their appearance and demeanor,\n\nand concluded that Dolly lacked capacity. The trial court, sitting as the finder of fact in this case,\n\nis the sole judge of the witnesses\u2019 credibility and the weight to be given their testimony. Schindler\n\nv. Schindler, 119 S.W.3d 923, 930 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2003, pet. denied). The trial court\u2019s finding\n\nof incapacity is not so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly\n\nwrong and unjust, and the evidence to support the finding is more than a scintilla. We conclude\n\nthat the evidence at trial was legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that\n\nDolly Bonham did not have testamentary capacity at the time of execution of the 2003 Will, and did\n\nnot have the requisite mental capacity to contract at the time of execution of the Third and Fourth\n\nAmendments of the trust instruments as well as the 2005 Deeds.\n\n\n        Removal of Trustees\n\n                In their second point on appeal, appellants assert that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding good cause for removing Mary Dildine and\n\nRhonda Adrian as trustees of the Bonham Family Trust. A court may, in its discretion, remove a\n\ntrustee for any of the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\ndiagnoses, despite the medical records to the contrary and her obligation to provide consent for\nDolly\u2019s medical care. Mary also denied any knowledge of Dolly making a 911 call in March 2004\nregarding a possible burglary at her ranch home several months after the date the incident actually\ntook place. However, the nurses\u2019 reports described a conversation about the subject between the\nnurses and Mary, including a note that Mary \u201cstated we could call her if we need to talk when the\npolice come.\u201d\n\n                                                   10\n\f       (1)     the trustee materially violated or attempted to violate the terms of the trust\n               and the violation or attempted violation results in a material financial loss to\n               the trust;\n\n       (2)     the trustee becomes incapacitated or insolvent;\n\n       (3)     the trustee fails to make an accounting that is required by law or by the terms\n               of the trust; or\n\n       (4)     the court finds other cause for removal.\n\n\nTex. Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 113.082(a) (West 2007). The trial court found \u201cgood cause\u201d for removing\n\nMary and Rhonda as trustees.\n\n               Appellants argue that the evidence does not establish any mismanagement or\n\nimproper conduct on the part of either Mary or Rhonda. However, there were actions taken by\n\nMary and Rhonda that, taken together, could constitute sufficient evidence for their removal as\n\ntrustees by the trial court. Mary spent trust funds, with Rhonda\u2019s approval, on blading work to build\n\na road accessing the partitioned tracts of the 292-acre ranch even though it caused the destruction\n\nof several large oak trees and Donald objected to the work. Mary also spent trust funds to pay\n\nher lawyers to litigate her claims against Donald and Donnie, and during the month prior to Dolly\u2019s\n\ndeath, disbursed trust funds of $10,000 each to Rhonda and Michelle, with no amounts disbursed\n\nto Donald or Donnie. When Donald and Donnie contacted Rhonda in an attempt to set a trustee\n\nmeeting in August 2005, Rhonda refused, calling it a \u201ccomplete waste of time.\u201d Moreover, in\n\nAugust 2006, Rhonda had a locked gate installed at the only entrance to the ranch so as to keep\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fDonald from accessing any of the trust property.4 We conclude that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s removal of Mary Dildine and Rhonda Adrian\n\nas trustees.\n\n\n        Attorneys\u2019 Fees\n\n               The probate court denied all parties\u2019 requests for attorneys\u2019 fees. Appellants in their\n\nthird point on appeal assert that the court erred in finding Mary Dildine was not entitled to recover\n\nher attorneys\u2019 fees out of the estate. For Mary to be so entitled, the probate code requires that her\n\nattempt to probate the 2003 Will have been made in good faith, regardless whether the probate was\n\nsuccessful or not:\n\n\n        When any person designated as executor in a will or an alleged will, or as\n        administrator with the will or alleged will annexed, defends it or prosecutes any\n        proceeding in good faith, and with just cause, for the purpose of having the will or\n        alleged will admitted to probate, whether successful or not, he shall be allowed out\n        of the estate his necessary expenses and disbursements, including reasonable\n        attorney\u2019s fees, in such proceedings.\n\n\nTex. Prob. Code Ann. \u00a7 243 (West 2003). Appellants contend that even if we affirm the\n\nprobate court\u2019s finding that Dolly lacked testamentary capacity to execute the 2003 Will, there is no\n\nevidence that Mary did not pursue the probate proceedings in good faith.\n\n               There was, however, some evidence from which the probate court could have\n\nconcluded that Mary and Rhonda were the parties actually responsible for the alterations to Dolly\u2019s\n\n\n        4\n         There was also evidence that, in December 2006, Mary or Rhonda had a trench dug across\nthe gravel road on the ranch, which was the only road available for Donald and Teresa to access\nTract E, where the memorial site for their deceased son is located.\n\n                                                 12\n\fdisposition of property made by the 2003 Will. For instance, many of the concerns about Donald\n\nand Donnie\u2019s relationship with the 292-acre ranch property, which according to Mary and Rhonda\u2019s\n\ntestimony at trial had caused Dolly to reduce the Bonham brothers\u2019 share of the inheritance, initially\n\nappeared in an April 2001 letter that Mary wrote to her parents, complaining that the split in property\n\nunder the 1995 Will was unfair. Appellants introduced into evidence a letter to Donald\u2014consisting\n\nof two typewritten pages, dated April 13, 2004, and signed by Dolly\u2014making a number of\n\nallegations against Donald and \u201cterminating all business and personal agreements\u201d with him.\n\nRhonda testified that she merely typed up what Dolly had dictated. However, the medical record\n\nincluded a Mini-Mental State Examination taken by Dolly on April 14, 2004, only one day later, and\n\nin connection with the exam, Dr. Sixty noted that Dolly, after attempting to write a three-word\n\nsentence, \u201cwasn\u2019t sure what she tried to write,\u201d and said she \u201chas ideas in head, but words won\u2019t\n\ncome.\u201d5 Also, the 2004 eviction lawsuit against Donald, which Mary alleged was on her mother\n\nDolly\u2019s behalf, was signed only by Mary. There is some evidence to support a determination that\n\nMary did not tender the 2003 Will for probate in good faith.\n\n               Given our affirmance of the trial court\u2019s finding that Dolly did not have testamentary\n\nor contractual capacity at relevant times, and the evidence from which the trial court could\n\nhave concluded that Mary and Rhonda were the parties actually responsible for the 2003 Will\u2019s\n\ndistribution of property in their favor, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Mary\u2019s\n\nrequest for attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Dr. Winston testified that the April 13, 2004 letter was \u201camazingly detailed and there is no\nway that [Dolly] could have done this.\u201d\n\n                                                  13\n\fConclusion\n\n              Finding no reversible error, we affirm the judgment of the probate court.\n\n\n\n\n                                            __________________________________________\n\n                                            G.
