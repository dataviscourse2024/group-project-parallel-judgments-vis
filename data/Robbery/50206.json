This is a companion case to Commonwealth v.\n\nLeiva, 484 Mass. 766 (2020).    There, we affirmed the convictions\n\nof Julio Brian Leiva, who was tried together with the defendant\n\nfor the shooting death of William Serrano during an attempted\n\nrobbery.   Id. at 767, 769, 770 n.2.    A Hampden County jury\n\nconvicted the defendant of murder in the first degree on\n\ntheories of deliberate premeditation and felony-murder, as well\n\nas armed assault with the intent to rob and unlawful possession\n\nof ammunition.     Before us are the defendant&#x27;s consolidated\n\nappeals from his convictions and from the denial of his motion\n\nfor a new trial.\n\n    The defendant has asserted numerous errors.      He contends\n\nthat the trial judge erred by (1) denying the defendant&#x27;s motion\n\nfor relief from prejudicial joinder, or otherwise failing to\n\nsever his trial from that of his codefendant, Leiva; (2)\n\nallowing the prosecutor to use an unauthenticated video\n\nrecording during the course of trial; (3) denying the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the\n\ncharge of murder in the first degree; (4) failing to instruct\n\nthe jury on an essential element of the charge of unlawful\n\npossession of ammunition; and (5) failing to instruct the jury\n\non involuntary manslaughter.    The defendant further contends,\n\nwith respect to his motion for a new trial, that the motion\n\njudge erred both in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing and\n\f                                                                      3\n\n\nin denying the defendant&#x27;s motion.      Finally, the defendant\n\nrequests relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.\n\n    We discern no reversible error with respect to the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s convictions of murder in the first degree and armed\n\nassault with the intent to rob.      Additionally, after a thorough\n\nreview of the record, we decline to exercise our authority under\n\nG. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.   Accordingly, we affirm the defendant&#x27;s\n\nconvictions of murder in the first degree and armed assault with\n\nthe intent to rob.    We also affirm the denial of the defendant&#x27;s\n\nmotion for a new trial.     However, because of an error in the\n\njury instructions, the defendant&#x27;s conviction of unlawful\n\npossession of ammunition must be vacated.\n\n    1.   Background.   a.   Facts.    We summarize the facts the\n\njury could have found, reserving further discussion of the facts\n\nfor our analysis infra.\n\n    On November 10, 2013, the day of the shooting, the victim\n\njoined his girlfriend for dinner at her sister&#x27;s residence in\n\nSpringfield.   About twenty minutes after the couple arrived,\n\nLeiva joined them, uninvited.    Leiva and the victim&#x27;s girlfriend\n\nhad previously dated, ending their relationship about six months\n\nprior to the shooting; they remained friendly after their\n\nrelationship ended.\n\n    Leiva stayed in the kitchen for about thirty minutes,\n\neating and sending text messages on his cell phone before\n\f                                                                     4\n\n\nabruptly leaving and returning about fifteen minutes later.\n\nAfter another ten to fifteen minutes had passed, Leiva departed\n\nagain.    He left through the back door of the house onto a small\n\nporch where he passed by the victim, who was seated in a chair\n\nwith the girlfriend on his lap.     Leiva, the victim, and the\n\ngirlfriend were the only people on the porch.\n\n     The girlfriend observed the defendant walk down the porch\n\nstairs, then around to the right, where he disappeared behind\n\nthe porch.    A few minutes later, Leiva reemerged from behind the\n\nporch, followed closely by two men in dark sweatshirts with\n\nraised hoods.    The girlfriend recognized one of the men as the\n\ndefendant, a friend of Leiva, whom she had known for over six\n\nmonths and with whom she frequently socialized.     As the three\n\nmen approached the porch steps, the girlfriend could see that\n\nLeiva was carrying what appeared to be a shotgun or rifle with a\n\nsawed-off barrel.1    She had previously seen this same gun at the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s residence.\n\n     Coming onto the porch, Leiva first pointed the barrel of\n\nthe gun at the girlfriend, who was attempting to block the top\n\nof the stairway.     The three men pushed past her and surrounded\n\nthe victim, with Leiva now aiming the gun at the victim&#x27;s chest.\n\nLeiva then instructed the other two men to &quot;run his pockets,&quot; at\n\n\n\n\n     1   Police never recovered the gun used by Leiva.\n\f                                                                      5\n\n\nwhich point the two men bent over to reach into the victim&#x27;s\n\npockets.   Although the girlfriend did not see what, if anything,\n\nthey retrieved, the victim was in possession of two cell phones\n\nearlier that evening, and only one was discovered among the\n\nvictim&#x27;s belongings.\n\n    When the victim, who was still seated in the chair, pleaded\n\nto be left alone, Leiva shot the victim seven times.       The\n\ndefendant and the other man stood on either side of Leiva,\n\nlooking on while facing the victim as the shots rang out.\n\nHearing the gunshots, the girlfriend&#x27;s sister called 911.\n\nSeveral minutes later, a responding officer entered the sister&#x27;s\n\nliving room and found the victim, who, while screaming and\n\nbleeding, had managed to crawl inside.    The victim was\n\ntransported to the hospital, where he later died in surgery.\n\nAfter leaving the area, Leiva explained to a friend that he\n\n&quot;went to go rob somebody&quot; while he was with two associates but\n\nthat things went wrong.\n\n    b.     Procedural history.   In February 2014, a Hampden County\n\ngrand jury indicted the defendant for murder in the first\n\ndegree, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1; armed assault with intent to murder,\n\nG. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18 (b); armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17; armed\n\nassault with intent to rob, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18 (b); and unlawful\n\npossession of ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (h).\n\f                                                                        6\n\n\n    The defendant&#x27;s joint trial with his codefendant, Leiva,\n\ncommenced in January 2016.    Before trial, defendant&#x27;s counsel\n\nfiled a motion for relief from prejudicial joinder, seeking to\n\nsever the two cases on the grounds that the defenses would be\n\nantagonistic.     The trial judge denied this motion.   At the close\n\nof the Commonwealth&#x27;s case, the trial judge allowed the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s motion for required findings of not guilty as to the\n\ncharge of armed assault with intent to murder but otherwise\n\ndenied the motion with respect to the remaining charges.\n\n    The jury acquitted the defendant of armed robbery but found\n\nhim guilty of murder in the first degree on theories of\n\ndeliberate premeditation and felony-murder with attempted\n\ncommission of armed robbery as the predicate felony, guilty of\n\narmed assault with the intent to rob, and guilty of unlawful\n\npossession of ammunition.\n\n    The defendant timely appealed.     While his direct appeal was\n\npending, the defendant filed a motion in this court for a new\n\ntrial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435\n\nMass. 1501 (2001).     We remanded the defendant&#x27;s motion to the\n\nSuperior Court.     After an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge,\n\nwho was not the trial judge, denied the defendant&#x27;s motion.       The\n\ndefendant&#x27;s motion to reconsider was likewise denied.\n\nThereafter, the defendant appealed from the denial of his motion\n\nfor a new trial, which we consolidated with his direct appeal.\n\f                                                                          7\n\n\n       c.    The trial.   At trial, the Commonwealth proceeded\n\nagainst the defendant as a joint venturer with Leiva in the\n\narmed robbery and murder of the victim.       In support of its\n\ntheory, the Commonwealth primarily relied upon the girlfriend&#x27;s\n\ntestimony concerning the events that evening, including\n\nidentifying the defendant as one of the other two men involved\n\nin the shooting.       See Leiva, 484 Mass. at 769-770.    The\n\ngirlfriend&#x27;s timeline of events was corroborated by surveillance\n\nfootage that was recorded at an apartment building where Leiva\n\nwould frequently stay while visiting Springfield, which depicted\n\nLeiva at various points on the evening of the shooting.2         Id. at\n\n768, 770.\n\n       Additionally, the Commonwealth&#x27;s ballistics expert opined\n\nthat seven shell casings recovered from the crime scene had been\n\nfired from the same weapon, as were five bullets recovered from\n\nthe scene of the shooting and the victim&#x27;s body.          Id. at 770-\n\n771.       The police seized from the defendant&#x27;s residence live\n\nrounds of ammunition of the same caliber and bearing the same\n\nmanufacturer&#x27;s markings as the shells recovered from the crime\n\nscene.      Id.\n\n       The defendant&#x27;s primary defense was that he had been\n\nmisidentified.       In support of this theory, counsel for the\n\n\n\n       The apartment building was approximately a two-minute walk\n       2\n\nfrom the sister&#x27;s residence.\n\f                                                                    8\n\n\ndefendant pointed to numerous factors in his closing, including\n\nthe girlfriend&#x27;s mistaken identification of the defendant due to\n\nher focus on the gun, the darkness of the setting, and the\n\npresence of hoods on Leiva&#x27;s associates, as well as the\n\ngirlfriend&#x27;s mistaken identification of another of Leiva&#x27;s\n\nassociates.\n\n    The defendant himself did not testify; Leiva, however,\n\ndid -- in narrative form -- which the judge permitted him to do\n\npursuant to Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.3 (e), as appearing at 471 Mass.\n\n1416 (2015) (rule 3.3 [e]).     See Leiva, 484 Mass. at 771\u2013773.\n\nThe judge also prohibited counsel from referencing the\n\ninvocation of rule 3.3 (e) and strongly cautioned them against\n\nexamining Leiva on this topic.     Leiva testified that, while he\n\nhad visited the sister&#x27;s residence on the day of the shooting,\n\nhe left to purchase some marijuana, did not see the defendant,\n\nand did not shoot the victim.      Id. at 771.\n\n    2.   Discussion.     a.   Standard of review.   &quot;Where we\n\nconsider, as we do here, a defendant&#x27;s direct appeal from a\n\nconviction of murder in the first degree together with an appeal\n\nfrom the denial of a motion for a new trial, we review the whole\n\ncase under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.&quot;      Commonwealth v. Goitia, 480\n\nMass. 763, 768 (2018).    &quot;Where the claims are preserved, we\n\nreview for prejudicial error&quot; (quotation and citation omitted).\n\nCommonwealth v. Gamboa, 490 Mass. 294, 299 n.8 (2022).      For\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nclaims that are unpreserved, and for &quot;other errors we discover\n\nafter a comprehensive review of the entire record, [we review]\n\nfor a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Upton, 484 Mass. 155, 160 (2020).\n\n     b.    Severance of the codefendants&#x27; trials.   The defendant\n\nfirst argues that severing his trial from the trial of his\n\ncodefendant, Leiva, was constitutionally required to protect his\n\ndue process rights and his right to confrontation,3 and that the\n\ntrial judge&#x27;s denial of his motion for relief from prejudicial\n\njoinder was otherwise an abuse of discretion.   These arguments\n\ncenter on Leiva&#x27;s testimony pursuant to rule 3.3 (e).\n\n     We have previously concluded that &quot;[t]he procedures used to\n\nimplement rule 3.3 (e) at the . . . trial were proper&quot; and that\n\nthe trial judge&#x27;s &quot;rulings relative to the form of [Leiva]&#x27;s\n\ntestimony . . . did not constitute error.&quot;    Leiva, 484 Mass. at\n\n784\u2013785.   Nonetheless, we reexamine the propriety of this\n\nprocedure and testimony in the context of the nontestifying\n\ndefendant&#x27;s severance arguments.4\n\n\n\n\n     3 Because, as we conclude infra, there was no error, we need\nnot reach the defendant&#x27;s argument that the alleged errors were\nstructural. See Commonwealth v. Scott, 470 Mass. 320, 337 n.15\n(2014).\n\n     4 We decline to hold, as the defendant insists, that\nrule 3.3 (e) is &quot;designed solely for use in single-defendant\ntrials.&quot; Because the defendant cites no legal authority in\nsupport of this proposition and presents it in cursory fashion,\n\f                                                                     10\n\n\n    i.    Due process.   The defendant asserts that severance was\n\nconstitutionally required because the Commonwealth knowingly\n\nused Leiva&#x27;s false testimony to secure the defendant&#x27;s\n\nconviction, or allowed for Leiva&#x27;s false testimony to go\n\nuncorrected, thereby violating the defendant&#x27;s due process\n\nrights.   As the defendant did not raise this issue at trial,5 we\n\nreview for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Ware, 482 Mass. 717, 721\u2013722 (2019).     We\n\nconclude that there was no error.\n\n    It is true that &quot;[t]he Commonwealth may not present\n\ntestimony at trial which [it] knows or should know is false&quot;\n\n(quotation omitted).     Ware, 482 Mass. at 721, quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Forte, 469 Mass. 469, 490 (2014).    &quot;Nor may the\n\nCommonwealth, &#x27;although not soliciting false evidence, allow[]\n\nit to go uncorrected when it appears.&#x27;&quot;     Ware, supra, quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Hurst, 364 Mass. 604, 608 (1974).     A conviction\n\nobtained in either scenario &quot;must fall under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment&quot; to the United States Constitution.     Napue v.\n\nIllinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959).     Here, it is clear that the\n\n\n\n&quot;we are not obligated to consider it here.&quot;     Halstrom v. Dube,\n481 Mass. 480, 483 n.8 (2019).\n\n    5  Although the defendant&#x27;s motion for relief from\nprejudicial joinder does not appear in the record, there is no\nindication that defense counsel ever argued, in writing or\norally, that the motion should be granted because of Leiva&#x27;s\nfalse testimony.\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\nCommonwealth did not affirmatively present false testimony,\n\ngiven that Leiva was not the Commonwealth&#x27;s witness, so the\n\nquestion is whether the Commonwealth allowed Leiva&#x27;s testimony\n\nto go uncorrected when it knew or should have known that his\n\ntestimony was false.\n\n    In order to correct testimony that is known to be false, a\n\nprosecutor must &quot;take such remedial measures before the jury\n\nretire[] as are necessary to ensure that [they are] not\n\ndeceived.&quot;    Gomez v. Commissioner of Correction, 336 Conn. 168,\n\n189 (2020).   Although the precise remedial measures employed may\n\nvary depending on the circumstances of a case, one such means of\n\ncorrecting false testimony is, of course, cross-examination.\n\nSee Leiva, 484 Mass. at 784 n.19 (&quot;Our system[] . . . hedges\n\nagainst the risk that judgment will be rendered on false\n\npremises by providing for rigorous cross-examination . . .&quot;).\n\nSee also Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 311 (1966) (&quot;The\n\nestablished safeguards of the Anglo-American legal system leave\n\nthe veracity of a witness to be tested by cross-examination, and\n\nthe credibility of his testimony to be determined by a properly\n\ninstructed jury&quot;).\n\n    Here, the prosecutor challenged the veracity of much of\n\nLeiva&#x27;s narrative testimony by conducting a vigorous and\n\nthorough cross-examination.    For example, the prosecutor showed\n\nsurveillance footage, depicting an individual running shortly\n\f                                                                    12\n\n\nafter the murder.   Although Leiva disputed that he was this\n\nindividual, he conceded -- in response to the prosecutor&#x27;s\n\nquestions -- that he is depicted in the footage at times before\n\nand after the running individual can be seen.    The implication\n\nwas clear:    the prosecutor sought for the jury to infer,\n\ncontrary to Leiva&#x27;s testimony, that the running individual was\n\nin fact Leiva.    Indeed, the prosecutor explicitly stated during\n\nclosing arguments that the jury &quot;would have every right to draw\n\nthe inference&quot; that this individual was Leiva.\n\n    With the prosecutor having rigorously cross-examined Leiva,\n\nit was for the jury to determine whether he was telling the\n\ntruth.    See Forte, 469 Mass. at 490.   Indeed, there can be no\n\ndoubt that the jury were not deceived by Leiva; in order to\n\nconvict him, the jury needed to reject Leiva&#x27;s version of\n\nevents.\n\n    Nonetheless, the defendant points out that the prosecutor\n\nasked Leiva on cross-examination whether he was trying &quot;to help\n\n[his] friend Amadi out,&quot; and further asked Leiva why he decided\n\nto testify.    By doing so, the defendant argues, the prosecutor\n\nwas insinuating that Leiva was &quot;Sosa&#x27;s witness.&quot;     As improper as\n\nthese questions may have been, the defendant&#x27;s theory has a\n\nfatal flaw:    Leiva never answered, as the trial judge sustained\n\nobjections to these questions before Leiva could do so.      The\n\njury had been previously instructed that, if an objection was\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\nsustained, they were to disregard the question and not speculate\n\nas to what the answer might have been.     See Commonwealth v.\n\nAndrade, 488 Mass. 522, 535 (2021) (&quot;Jurors are presumed to\n\nfollow the instructions given&quot;).      Accordingly, because the\n\nprosecutor did not knowingly use, or knowingly fail to correct,\n\nfalse testimony from Leiva, the defendant&#x27;s due process rights\n\nwere not violated.6\n\n     ii.    Right to confrontation.   The defendant next claims\n\nthat severance was required because he was deprived of a\n\nconstitutional right to cross-examine Leiva on a &quot;critical issue\n\nof bias&quot;:    that Leiva was testifying falsely pursuant to rule\n\n3.3 (e).    We review for abuse of discretion and conclude that\n\nthe trial judge did not abuse his discretion by restricting\n\ncross-examination of Leiva&#x27;s invocation of rule 3.3 (e).     See\n\nCommonwealth v. Miles, 420 Mass. 67, 71-72 (1995).\n\n     &quot;Both the Sixth Amendment [to the United States\n\nConstitution] and art. 12 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of\n\nRights] guarantee a criminal defendant&#x27;s right to confront the\n\n\n     6 We also reject the defendant&#x27;s claim that the trial judge\nmisled the jury by placing Leiva under oath, as if to suggest\nthat Leiva&#x27;s testimony was true. Swearing or affirming one&#x27;s\nduty to testify truthfully is a prerequisite to testifying. See\nCommonwealth v. Stewart, 454 Mass. 527, 531 (2009). If placing\na witness under oath could somehow be construed as an\nendorsement of the veracity of his or her testimony, it would be\nimpossible for the jury to ever engage in their role of\ndetermining witness credibility. See Commonwealth v. Casey (No.\n1), 442 Mass. 1, 8 (2004).\n\f                                                                    14\n\n\nwitnesses against him through cross-examination.&quot;      Miles, 420\n\nMass. at 71.   &quot;In determining whether a defendant&#x27;s\n\nconstitutional right to cross-examine and thus to confront a\n\nwitness against him has been denied because of an unreasonable\n\nlimitation of cross-examination, we weigh the materiality of the\n\nwitness&#x27;s direct testimony and the degree of the restriction on\n\ncross-examination.&quot;    Id. at 72, citing Commonwealth v. Kirouac,\n\n405 Mass. 557, 561 (1989).\n\n    While criminal defendants have a right to cross-examine\n\nprosecution witnesses concerning their bias, a judge may\n\nproperly foreclose such examination where the theory of bias is\n\n&quot;too tenuous&quot; or &quot;too speculative.&quot;    Commonwealth v. Bui, 419\n\nMass. 392, 401-402, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 861 (1995).      Here,\n\nthe connection between the invocation of rule 3.3 (e) and any\n\nconceivable bias on Leiva&#x27;s part is simply too tenuous.     The\n\ndefendant does not adequately explain how the invocation of rule\n\n3.3 (e) would motivate Leiva to testify falsely.    At best, he\n\nseems to vaguely suggest that preventing cross-examination on\n\nthis topic would somehow incentivize Leiva to perjure himself\n\nbecause the falsity of his testimony would be shielded from\n\ndisclosure.    But the judge did not prevent counsel from\n\nattacking the actual substance of Leiva&#x27;s testimony; indeed, as\n\nwe explained supra, the prosecutor did so to great effect.\n\f                                                                     15\n\n\n    Moreover, we do not accept the notion that Leiva would have\n\nbeen encouraged to perjure himself through the invocation of\n\nrule 3.3 (e), particularly where the record demonstrates that\n\nLeiva&#x27;s attorney confirmed at sidebar that he had advised Leiva\n\nin accordance with the rule.    The advice required of counsel\n\nunder rule 3.3 (e) is designed to dissuade false testimony, not\n\nencourage it.    See Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.3 (e) (&quot;In a criminal\n\ncase, defense counsel . . . has a duty strongly to discourage\n\nthe client from testifying falsely, advising that such a course\n\nis unlawful, will have substantial adverse consequences, and\n\nshould not be followed&quot;).    Given the attenuation between rule\n\n3.3 (e) and Leiva&#x27;s motive for testifying, the judge did not\n\nabuse his discretion.\n\n    iii.   Prejudicial joinder.     The defendant&#x27;s final argument\n\nconcerning severance is that the judge abused his discretion in\n\ndenying the defendant&#x27;s motion for relief from prejudicial\n\njoinder.   &quot;Absent a constitutional requirement for severance,\n\njoinder and severance are matters committed to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial judge.&quot;     Commonwealth v. McAfee, 430\n\nMass. 483, 485 (1999).    Accordingly, we review the judge&#x27;s\n\ndenial of the motion for relief from prejudicial joinder for\n\nabuse of discretion.     See Commonwealth v. Akara, 465 Mass. 245,\n\n256 (2013).     We conclude there was no error.\n\f                                                                 16\n\n\n    &quot;A judge should sever trials if a defendant meets the\n\nburden of proving that (1) the defenses are &#x27;antagonistic to the\n\npoint of being mutually exclusive,&#x27; or (2) &#x27;the prejudice\n\nresulting from a joint trial is so compelling that it prevents a\n\ndefendant from obtaining a fair trial&#x27;&quot; (citations omitted).\n\nCommonwealth v. Siny Van Tran, 460 Mass. 535, 542 (2011).\n\nRegarding the first basis, &quot;defenses are mutually antagonistic\n\nand irreconcilable where the &#x27;sole defense of each [is] the\n\nguilt of the other.&#x27;&quot;    Id., quoting Commonwealth v. Stewart, 450\n\nMass. 25, 31 (2007).     It is not enough to require severance\n\nsimply because the defendants &quot;assert inconsistent trial\n\nstrategies,&quot; Siny Van Tran, supra, or because &quot;a defendant would\n\nstand a better chance of acquittal if tried alone.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. DePina, 476 Mass. 614, 629 (2017).\n\n    Here, the defenses of Leiva and the defendant were not\n\nmutually antagonistic.    Indeed, we previously noted that the\n\ndefendant and Leiva &quot;advanced entirely consistent trial\n\ndefenses.&quot;   Leiva, 484 Mass. at 793 n.35.    The defendant\n\nasserted he was misidentified as one of the participants, and\n\nLeiva similarly denied that he shot the victim.     Under the facts\n\nof this case, the jury were free to conclude both that the\n\ndefendant was misidentified and that Leiva did not shoot the\n\nvictim.   See Commonwealth v. Watson, 487 Mass. 156, 168\u2013169\n\n(2021) (defenses not so mutually antagonistic requiring\n\f                                                                     17\n\n\nseverance where codefendants argued misidentification and lack\n\nof involvement).   Thus, &quot;as the jury could have accepted either\n\ncodefendant&#x27;s argument while at the same time acquitting the\n\nother,&quot; the defenses presented were not mutually antagonistic.\n\nCommonwealth v. Fan, 490 Mass. 433, 440 (2022).\n\n    Likewise, Leiva&#x27;s testimony, which in no way implicated the\n\ndefendant, did not prevent the defendant from receiving a fair\n\ntrial.   Rather than pointing the finger at the defendant, Leiva\n\ntestified that he had not seen the defendant on the day of the\n\nmurder, and he denied having referred to the defendant in\n\nconnection with the shooting.     Among his scant testimony that\n\neven related to the defendant, Leiva acknowledged that he had\n\ninitially asked a friend to pick him up at the defendant&#x27;s\n\naddress on the night of the shooting, before changing his\n\nrequest to a different address.    But this same information had\n\nalready been introduced in evidence independently through the\n\nfriend&#x27;s testimony, as well as through a printout of text\n\nmessages exchanged between Leiva and the friend.     Thus, Leiva&#x27;s\n\ntestimony on this point &quot;was at best cumulative&quot; of other\n\nevidence in the record.   Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 462 Mass. 827,\n\n837 (2012).   Accordingly, the judge did not abuse his discretion\n\nin denying the defendant&#x27;s motion.\n\n    c.   Use of compilation video recording.     A Springfield\n\npolice officer testified at trial that, shortly after the night\n\f                                                                  18\n\n\nof the shooting, he extracted surveillance footage from a\n\ndigital video recorder that was provided by the property\n\nmanagement office at the apartment building where Leiva went on\n\nthe night of the shooting.   The complete video footage contained\n\nseveral camera angles of the property, spanning multiple hours\n\naround the time of the shooting.   From this longer, multiple-\n\nhour video footage, a condensed video recording (compilation\n\nvideo) was created, culled to what was relevant to the shooting.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial judge erred in allowing the\n\nprosecutor to use this compilation video because it was never\n\nauthenticated, marked for identification, or admitted in\n\nevidence.7   In response, the Commonwealth emphasizes that the\n\ncomplete footage, from which the compilation was derived, was\n\nadmitted in evidence.\n\n     As defendant&#x27;s counsel objected to the use of the\n\ncompilation video, &quot;we review to determine whether the judge\n\nabused [his] discretion and, if so, whether the error resulted\n\nin prejudice to the defendant&quot; (quotation and citation omitted).\n\nCommonwealth v. Davis, 487 Mass. 448, 465 (2021), S.C., 491\n\nMass. 1011 (2023).   &quot;An error is not prejudicial if it did not\n\ninfluence the jury, or had but very slight effect&quot; (quotation\n\n\n     7 The prosecutor used the compilation video at several\npoints during his cross-examination of Leiva. The prosecutor\nalso showed various clips from the compilation video to the jury\nduring closing arguments.\n\f                                                                    19\n\n\nand citation omitted).   Commonwealth v. Irene, 462 Mass. 600,\n\n618, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 968 (2012).    We conclude that,\n\nassuming error, the defendant was not prejudiced by the\n\nprosecutor&#x27;s use of the compilation video.\n\n    The defendant does not argue that the complete footage\n\nitself was erroneously admitted, where testimony was offered to\n\nauthenticate that footage.   In particular, an officer described\n\nat trial how the complete surveillance footage was transported\n\nand copied.   Additionally, an employee from the property\n\nmanagement office testified as to how this footage was provided\n\nto the police, and offered various details concerning the\n\ncameras that recorded this footage.\n\n    Further, it is undisputed that the compilation video was a\n\nsubset of this longer surveillance footage that had already been\n\nadmitted in evidence.    There is no indication that, for example,\n\nthe visuals contained within the compilation video were somehow\n\ndigitally altered to depict events    that were different from\n\nthose depicted in the complete footage.    We have reviewed the\n\ncompilation video and compared it to the corresponding times\n\nfrom the original surveillance footage.    Based upon our review,\n\nwe conclude that the sequencing of certain events from the\n\nlonger video footage into the compilation video &quot;added little to\n\nthe Commonwealth&#x27;s case and detracted little from the\n\f                                                                  20\n\n\ndefendant&#x27;s theory at trial.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Wood, 90 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 271, 282 (2016).\n\n    Therefore, under these circumstances, we are convinced that\n\nthe defendant suffered no prejudice.   See Commonwealth v.\n\nKozubal, 488 Mass. 575, 588 (2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct.\n\n2723 (2022) (even if admission of isolated text messages between\n\ndefendant and victim was error, defendant was not prejudiced,\n\n&quot;given the cumulative nature of the evidence, including the\n\nadmission of the many text messages between the defendant and\n\nthe victim that the defendant does not contest&quot;).\n\n    Finally, we note that while the defendant suffered no\n\nprejudice here, the better practice is to authenticate excerpts\n\nthat have been copied from an exhibit, even when the complete\n\nexhibit itself has already been authenticated and admitted in\n\nevidence, to ensure that those excerpts are accurate copies.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Leneski, 66 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 294 (2006)\n\n(&quot;properly authenticated&quot; copy of videotape is admissible if\n\notherwise relevant).   Additionally, although the Commonwealth\n\ndid not do so here, parties should explore the viability of\n\nadmitting excerpts of voluminous video recordings pursuant to\n\nMass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1006 (2023), particularly where a jury may find\n\nit &quot;difficult to master the technology necessary to find and\n\nview the relevant parts of the [complete] videos in the jury\n\nroom.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Suarez, 95 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 571-572\n\f                                                                   21\n\n\n(2019) (no abuse of discretion in admitting compilation of\n\nsurveillance videos pursuant to Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1006).\n\n    d.     Deliberate premeditation.   The defendant also contends\n\nthat the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required\n\nfinding of not guilty on the charge of murder in the first\n\ndegree based upon the theory of deliberate premeditation.    He\n\nclaims the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find that\n\nhe intended to kill the victim, reasoning that because Leiva&#x27;s\n\nintent to kill is not attributable to the defendant, the\n\nevidence at best supported an inference that the defendant\n\nintended to rob or intimidate the victim.    Additionally, the\n\ndefendant maintains that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nestablish deliberate premeditation, reasoning that, since &quot;the\n\nabrupt shooting&quot; was a &quot;surprise&quot; to him, the defendant&#x27;s intent\n\nwas not &quot;the product of cool reflection.&quot;    See Commonwealth v.\n\nColas, 486 Mass. 831, 836 (2021), quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nTavares, 471 Mass. 430, 435 (2015).    Although we acknowledge\n\nthat the issue is close, we conclude that the trial judge did\n\nnot err.\n\n    In reviewing the denial of such a motion, we ask whether\n\n&quot;the Commonwealth&#x27;s evidence, together with reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom, when viewed in its light most favorable to\n\nthe Commonwealth, is sufficient to persuade a rational jury of\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; (quotation and\n\f                                                                     22\n\n\ncitation omitted).    Commonwealth v. Gibson, 488 Mass. 854, 857\n\n(2022).   &quot;The relevant question is whether the evidence would\n\npermit a jury to find guilt, not whether the evidence requires\n\nsuch a finding.&quot;     Commonwealth v. Brown, 401 Mass. 745, 747\n\n(1988).\n\n    For the defendant to be convicted on a theory of deliberate\n\npremeditation, the Commonwealth had to prove that he &quot;had or\n\nshared an intent to kill or cause death&quot; (quotation and citation\n\nomitted).   Tavares, 471 Mass. at 435.    Additionally, the\n\nCommonwealth had to prove that the decision to kill &quot;was the\n\nproduct of cool reflection&quot; (citation omitted).     Colas, 486\n\nMass. at 836.     &quot;Circumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient\n\nto prove deliberate premeditation.&quot;     Commonwealth v. Salazar,\n\n481 Mass. 105, 111 (2018).    &quot;No particular period of reflection\n\nis required for deliberate premeditation to be found.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Chipman, 418 Mass. 262, 269 (1994).     &quot;Thus, if\n\nthere was evidence presented from which the jury could infer\n\nthat the defendant intended to kill [the victim], and the\n\ndecision was the result of some period of reflection, however\n\nshort, then the defendant&#x27;s motion . . . was properly denied.&quot;\n\nTavares, supra.\n\n    Here, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nCommonwealth, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury\n\ncould infer that the defendant shared Leiva&#x27;s intent to kill the\n\f                                                                   23\n\n\nvictim, and that this shared intent was the product of a period\n\nof reflection.     Although Leiva&#x27;s intent is not imputed to the\n\ndefendant, &quot;[t]he jury may infer the requisite mental state [for\n\na joint venturer] from [his] knowledge of the circumstances and\n\nsubsequent participation in the offense&quot; (citation omitted).\n\nCommonwealth v. Freeman, 442 Mass. 779, 782\u2013783 (2004), S.C.,\n\n451 Mass. 1006 (2008).    Thus, the defendant&#x27;s intent can be\n\n&quot;inferred from evidence that [the] defendant (a) observed\n\n[Leiva] demonstrate or express lethal intent (e.g., by producing\n\na gun) and (b) thereafter took some step to help carry out that\n\nintent.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Gonzalez, 475 Mass. 396, 416\u2013417\n\n(2016).\n\n    As defense counsel conceded at oral argument before this\n\ncourt, there was sufficient evidence that the defendant knew\n\nthat Leiva possessed a gun.   Indeed, the defendant had ample\n\nopportunity to observe the gun, given that the defendant was\n\nstanding next to Leiva, the encounter took several minutes, and\n\nLeiva pointed the gun at the girlfriend before aiming it at the\n\nvictim.    See Commonwealth v. Norris, 462 Mass. 131, 140 (2012).\n\nAlthough the Commonwealth was not obligated to prove that the\n\ndefendant knew Leiva was armed, the defendant&#x27;s knowledge is\n\nprobative as to his intent.    See Commonwealth v. Rosa, 468 Mass.\n\n231, 245 (2014) (proof of defendant&#x27;s knowledge that coventurer\n\nis armed is not required).\n\f                                                                  24\n\n\n     Additionally, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to\n\nconclude that the defendant supplied both the gun and the\n\nammunition, including (1) the girlfriend&#x27;s testimony that she\n\nhad previously seen the murder weapon at the defendant&#x27;s\n\nresidence and that the defendant was friends with Leiva; (2) the\n\ngirlfriend&#x27;s testimony that she witnessed Leiva disappear behind\n\nthe porch and re-emerge with the defendant while holding a gun;\n\nand (3) expert testimony that the caliber and manufacturer\n\nmarkings of the ammunition found in the defendant&#x27;s basement\n\nmatched the caliber of the bullets recovered from the victim&#x27;s\n\nbody and the markings on the casings found at the crime scene.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Beliard, 443 Mass. 79, 81-82, 86 (2004).\n\nSee also Gonzalez, 475 Mass. at 416 (&quot;knowledge and intent [may\n\nbe] inferred . . . when a defendant brings a gun to the scene of\n\nthe killing, but does not [himself] fire the fatal shot&quot;).\n\n     We also look to the defendant&#x27;s conduct at the time of the\n\nshooting to infer intent.   See Freeman, 442 Mass. at 782\u2013783.\n\nFirst, the defendant complied with Leiva&#x27;s instruction to &quot;run&quot;\n\nthe victim&#x27;s pockets.8   Second, as Leiva shot the victim seven\n\n\n     8 To be sure, an intent to rob cannot be conflated with an\nintent to kill. See Commonwealth v. Mandile, 403 Mass. 93, 100\nn.11 (1988). However, conduct that could support an inference\nthat a defendant intended to rob a victim may, under the right\ncircumstances, also support an inference that a defendant\nintended to kill a victim. See, e.g., Freeman, 442 Mass. at\n783. Here, even if this conduct is more probative as to the\ndefendant&#x27;s intent to rob the victim, it nonetheless has some\n\f                                                                   25\n\n\ntimes, the defendant stood by Leiva&#x27;s side facing the victim.\n\nWhile mere presence at a crime scene is not sufficient to\n\nestablish intent, when viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the Commonwealth, the jury did not have to infer\n\nthat the defendant&#x27;s intent was merely to rob or intimidate the\n\nvictim as he suggests.     See Gonzalez, 475 Mass. at 414.    To the\n\ncontrary, the evidence at trial demonstrated that the three men\n\nwere positioned in such a way as to effectively block the victim\n\nfrom the kitchen door and the porch stairs -- his only two means\n\nof escape.   In other words, the victim was &quot;[t]rapped in his\n\nchair&quot; on the small porch, while the three men stood over him.\n\nLeiva, 484 Mass. at 767.    Thus, the jury could have reasonably\n\ninferred that the defendant flanked Leiva, towering over the\n\nvictim with the intent of making the crime succeed.     See\n\nCommonwealth v. Bonner, 489 Mass. 268, 279 (2022) (defendant\n\nstanding next to shooter, who continued to aim gun at victim\n\nafter shooting, was probative as to defendant&#x27;s shared intent to\n\nkill victim); Watson, 487 Mass. at 163 (reasonable for jury to\n\ninfer defendant&#x27;s role was to block street so others could not\n\ninterfere while coventurer shot victim).    That is, a rational\n\njury could reasonably infer that the defendant helped block the\n\n\n\n\nweight as to the defendant&#x27;s intent to kill the victim,\nparticularly given that the defendant knew that Leiva was armed.\n\f                                                                    26\n\n\nvictim from escaping to ensure that Leiva could accomplish his\n\ngoal:   shooting and killing the victim.\n\n    While the inference that the defendant intended to block\n\nthe victim from escaping is not itself inescapable, &quot;reasonable\n\ninferences . . . need not be necessary or inescapable, only\n\nreasonable and possible&quot; (quotations and citation omitted).\n\nCommonwealth v. Schoener, 491 Mass. 706, 714 (2023).   Moreover,\n\n&quot;[t]he line that separates mere knowledge of unlawful conduct\n\nand participation in it, is &#x27;often vague and uncertain.     It is\n\nwithin the province of the jury to determine from the evidence\n\nwhether a particular defendant [has] crossed that line.&#x27;&quot;\n\nNorris, 462 Mass. at 140, quoting Commonwealth v. Longo, 402\n\nMass. 482, 487 (1988).   Therefore, there was sufficient evidence\n\nfor a rational jury to conclude that the defendant intended to\n\nkill the victim.\n\n    There was likewise sufficient evidence for a rational jury\n\nto conclude that the defendant&#x27;s intent was a product of\n\ndeliberate premeditation.   Given the abrupt comings and goings\n\nof Leiva over the course of the evening, and the defendant&#x27;s\n\nsudden appearance from behind the porch alongside Leiva, who was\n\nat that point wielding a firearm, a jury could reasonably infer\n\nthat the defendant was &quot;lying in wait&quot; with the murder weapon\n\nuntil the right time to provide the weapon to Leiva and join him\n\nin a confrontation with the victim.   Tavares, 471 Mass. at 435\u2013\n\f                                                                    27\n\n\n436.    See Commonwealth v. Robinson, 482 Mass. 741, 746 (2019)\n\n(&quot;Deliberate premeditation can be inferred from the bringing of\n\na firearm to the scene of the killing . . .&quot;).\n\n       Further, there is no evidence that the defendant was\n\n&quot;surprise[d],&quot; as he claims; rather, the evidence was that he\n\nfreely stood by Leiva&#x27;s side as the victim was shot seven times.\n\nAccordingly, &quot;[t]his case . . . does not suggest plain\n\nspontaneity or tainted premeditation.&quot;      Commonwealth v. Rivera,\n\n482 Mass. 259, 272 (2019).     In short, while any one fact in this\n\ncase would have been insufficient on its own, &quot;the entirety of\n\nthe facts presented &#x27;form[ed] a fabric of proof that was\n\nsufficient to warrant the jury&#x27;s finding beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the defendant&#x27; was guilty of murder in the first\n\ndegree on a theory of deliberate premeditation as a joint\n\nventurer.&quot;    Commonwealth v. Javier, 481 Mass. 268, 285 (2019),\n\nquoting Commonwealth v. Rojas, 388 Mass. 626, 630 (1983).\n\n       e.   Felony-murder.   The defendant also argues that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to support his conviction of felony-\n\nmurder in the first degree with the attempted commission of\n\narmed robbery as the predicate felony.      Although not clearly\n\narticulated in the defendant&#x27;s briefing, the defendant&#x27;s\n\nargument appears to suggest that the trial judge was required to\n\ninstruct the jury that they had to find, as an essential\n\n&quot;factual&quot; element of felony-murder, that the maximum sentence\n\f                                                                    28\n\n\nfor the predicate felony -- armed robbery -- is &quot;punishable by a\n\nmaximum sentence of life imprisonment.&quot;    Because the jury were\n\nnot so instructed and no &quot;evidence&quot; of this &quot;fact&quot; was\n\npresented, the defendant contends, his conviction of felony-\n\nmurder &quot;is invalid.&quot;\n\n     We disagree.   The penalty for armed robbery, as with other\n\ncriminal offenses, is set by statute; thus, the maximum sentence\n\nallowable for armed robbery is a matter of statutory\n\ninterpretation -- &quot;a pure question of law.&quot;    Commonwealth v.\n\nCintolo, 415 Mass. 358, 359 (1993).    Accordingly, this question\n\nis &quot;for the judge, not the jury.&quot;     Commonwealth v. Trotto, 487\n\nMass. 708, 735 (2021).   Here, as the defendant concedes, the\n\ntrial judge correctly instructed the jury that armed robbery is,\n\nas a matter of law, a felony with a maximum sentence of life\n\nimprisonment.   See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17.   Accordingly, the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s argument fails.\n\n     f.   Unlawful possession of ammunition.   In his brief, the\n\ndefendant argues, with respect to his conviction of unlawful\n\npossession of ammunition under G.     L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (h), that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence that he knew that Leiva&#x27;s\n\nfirearm was loaded.9   Subsequently, in light of the United States\n\n\n     9 The Commonwealth proceeded on a theory that the defendant\nconstructively possessed the ammunition found at the crime\nscene; he was not charged in connection with the ammunition\nseized from his residence.\n\f                                                                    29\n\n\nSupreme Court&#x27;s holding in New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Ass&#x27;n\n\nv. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2122 (2022), that the Second\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution protects an\n\nindividual&#x27;s right to carry a firearm outside the home, this\n\ncourt concluded that &quot;licensure is . . . an essential element of\n\nthe crime of unlawful possession of ammunition under G. L.\n\nc. 269, \u00a7 10 (h).&quot;    Commonwealth v. Guardado, 491 Mass. 666, 692\n\n(2023) (Guardado I), vacated in part, 493 Mass. 1, 12 (2023)\n\n(Guardado II).   The defendant thereafter filed a supplemental\n\nbrief in which he argues that our holding in Guardado I\n\nnecessitates that his unlawful possession conviction be vacated\n\nand remanded for entry of a judgment of acquittal.\n\n       We agree that the defendant&#x27;s conviction must be vacated.\n\nIt is a violation of a defendant&#x27;s Second Amendment and due\n\nprocess rights &quot;when he [i]s convicted of unlawfully possessing\n\nammunition although the jury were not instructed that licensure\n\nis an essential element of the crime.&quot;    Guardado I, 491 Mass. at\n\n693.   &quot;[T]he Commonwealth carries the burden of proving each\n\nelement of a charged crime.&quot;    Id. at 682.   Here, the jury were\n\nnot instructed that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s lack of licensure as an element of the crime.\n\nThus, the defendant&#x27;s unlawful possession conviction must be\n\nvacated.\n\f                                                                    30\n\n\n    However, we disagree with the defendant&#x27;s proposal to\n\nremand for entry of a judgment of acquittal.    The proper remedy\n\nunder these circumstances is to remand for a new trial.     See\n\nGuardado II, 493 Mass. at 6-7, 12.    Accordingly, the\n\nCommonwealth shall have an opportunity to prove that the\n\ndefendant unlawfully possessed ammunition.     Id. at 2-3, 12.\n\n    g.    Manslaughter instruction.   The defendant next argues\n\nthat the judge erred in denying his request for an involuntary\n\nmanslaughter instruction.   The defendant reasons that the jury\n\ncould have found that the defendant acted &quot;wanton[ly]&quot; or\n\n&quot;reckless[ly]&quot; in accompanying Leiva to merely frighten or\n\nintimidate the victim, rather than to kill or rob him.     As the\n\ndefendant requested an involuntary manslaughter instruction at\n\ntrial, we review for prejudicial error.   See Commonwealth v.\n\nPina, 481 Mass. 413, 422 (2019).   We conclude that, even\n\nassuming that the judge erred, there was no prejudice.\n\n    Ordinarily, in the case of felony-murder, &quot;the defendant is\n\nnot entitled to an instruction on manslaughter&quot; (citation\n\nomitted).   Commonwealth v. Carter, 475 Mass. 512, 523 (2016).\n\nNonetheless, &quot;[a]n instruction on involuntary manslaughter is\n\nappropriate in a felony-murder case . . . if there is evidence\n\nthat the defendant was merely engaged in wanton [or] reckless\n\nconduct . . . .&quot;   Commonwealth v. Donovan, 422 Mass. 349, 353\n\n(1996).   Here, while the jury were not instructed on involuntary\n\f                                                                    31\n\n\nmanslaughter, the trial judge did instruct the jury on murder in\n\nthe second degree, based on theories of both malice and felony-\n\nmurder.    Because the jury found the defendant guilty of murder\n\nin the first degree based on both theories, the judge&#x27;s\n\ninstruction on murder in the second degree precludes any\n\nconclusion of prejudice.     See Commonwealth v. Chase, 433 Mass.\n\n293, 300 (2001) (&quot;This is not a case where the failure to\n\ninstruct on a lesser included offense left the jury with no\n\nalternative between a murder conviction and an acquittal&quot;).     See\n\nalso Donovan, supra at 354 (&quot;If the jury believed that the\n\ndefendant shared some lesser intent than that required for [the\n\nunderlying felony for felony-murder in the first degree], they\n\nhad the option of returning a verdict of murder in the second\n\ndegree.    They did not&quot;).\n\n    h.     Motion for a new trial.   i.   Ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.   In his motion for a new trial, the defendant asserted\n\nthat his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to\n\ntimely file a motion to suppress the ballistics evidence seized\n\nfrom the basement of the apartment building where the defendant\n\nresided.    The defendant maintained that the search warrant\n\naffidavit of Springfield police Detective Timothy Kenney failed\n\nto establish probable cause to search the basement for firearms,\n\nammunition, and related evidence.     In denying the defendant&#x27;s\n\f                                                                    32\n\n\nmotion for a new trial, the motion judge concluded that there\n\nwas probable cause to search the basement common area.\n\n    On appeal, the defendant reiterates his argument that there\n\nwas no probable cause to search the basement for ammunition or\n\nfirearms, and therefore, the motion judge erred in concluding\n\notherwise.   The Commonwealth counters that the defendant lacked\n\na reasonable expectation of privacy in the basement, and\n\ntherefore no search occurred in the constitutional sense.     The\n\ndefendant asserts that the Commonwealth&#x27;s argument must be\n\ndisregarded because the record is incomplete as to whether the\n\nbasement is a common area.    The defendant&#x27;s argument misses the\n\nmark.\n\n    Where, as here, a defendant&#x27;s motion for a new trial based\n\non ineffective assistance of counsel has been denied and we are\n\nreviewing it alongside his direct appeal pursuant to G. L.\n\nc. 278, \u00a7 33E, our task is to determine whether counsel erred\n\nand, if he did, whether that error &quot;was likely to have\n\ninfluenced the jury&#x27;s conclusion&quot; (citation omitted).\n\nCommonwealth v. Montez, 450 Mass. 736, 754 (2008).     More\n\nspecifically, &quot;the defendant must show that the motion to\n\nsuppress would have been successful, and that failing to bring\n\nsuch a motion . . . created a substantial likelihood of a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.&quot;     Commonwealth v. Banville, 457 Mass.\n\n530, 534 (2010).\n\f                                                                   33\n\n\n     Here, the evidence presented in connection with the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s motion for a new trial implicates, at minimum, a\n\nlikelihood that the basement is a common area.10   The basement\n\nwas part of a three-family residence.   In general, occupants of\n\na multiunit residence lack a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nin its common areas.   See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Montanez, 410\n\nMass. 290, 302 (1991).   That said, the question whether such an\n\noccupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a\n\npurportedly common area &quot;cannot be answered categorically.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Dora, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144\u2013145 (2003).      If\n\nthat question were to be answered in the negative, then &quot;the\n\npolice [were] free to search [the basement] without a warrant\n\nand without probable cause.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Porter P., 456\n\nMass. 254, 259 (2010).\n\n     However, we need not answer that question.    It is true that\n\nsome details regarding the basement are unclear.11   But this is\n\n\n     10For example, at an evidentiary hearing on the defendant&#x27;s\nmotion for a new trial, Detective Kenney testified that the\nbasement could be accessed through a staircase that connects to\neach apartment. Additionally, there were no clearly marked\nareas in the basement that could be used to attribute ownership\nto particular individuals. However, Detective Kenney could not\nrecall whether the basement had a door or whether he forced\nentry to gain access to the basement.\n\n     11For example, it is unclear whether, assuming that the\nbasement had a door, it was locked at the time of the search.\nIt is likewise unclear who actually used the basement and\nwhether any residents were excluded from using the basement. We\nexpress no opinion as to the precise facts that would have been\n\f                                                                     34\n\n\nprecisely why a motion to suppress would have failed -- because\n\nit is the defendant&#x27;s burden to demonstrate that he had a\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the basement and its\n\ncontents at the time of the search, rather than the\n\nCommonwealth&#x27;s burden to show that he had no reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy.   See Commonwealth v. Netto, 438 Mass.\n\n686, 697 (2003).   Therefore, &quot;if the record is unclear,&quot; the\n\ndefendant has failed to meet his burden.    Id.   In this context,\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s burden on his motion for a new trial is the same\n\nas the burden he would have had if his trial counsel had filed a\n\nmotion to suppress; that is, in order to meet his burden of\n\ndemonstrating that a motion to suppress would have been\n\nsuccessful for purposes of his motion for a new trial, the\n\ndefendant was obligated to present sufficient evidence that\n\ndemonstrated he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the\n\nbasement.   See Commonwealth v. Druce, 453 Mass. 686, 703 (2009)\n\n(&quot;A defendant who seeks a new trial based on ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel bears the burden of proving the\n\nineffectiveness&quot;).\n\n    Here, nothing that the defendant submitted in support of\n\nhis motion for a new trial resolves whether he had a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy in the basement.    Without even, for\n\n\n\nrequired for the defendant to demonstrate a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in this case.\n\f                                                                   35\n\n\nexample, a signed affidavit from the defendant providing\n\nadditional details concerning the basement, the defendant did\n\nnot satisfy his threshold burden of demonstrating that a search\n\nin the constitutional sense had occurred at all.   See\n\nCommonwealth v. D&#x27;Onofrio, 396 Mass. 711, 714 (1986).\n\n    While the motion judge did not address whether the\n\ndefendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy, &quot;[a]n\n\nappellate court is free to affirm a ruling on grounds different\n\nfrom those relied on by the motion judge if the correct or\n\npreferred basis for affirmance is supported by the record and\n\nthe findings.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe, 425 Mass. 99, 102\n\n(1997).   The record clearly supports the conclusion that the\n\ndefendant did not meet his threshold burden of demonstrating\n\nthat he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the basement.\n\nAccordingly, the motion judge did not err in denying the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s motion for a new trial.\n\n    ii.   Evidentiary hearing.   The defendant also argues, with\n\nrespect to his motion for a new trial, that the motion judge\n\nerred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing.   However, the\n\nmotion judge did hold an evidentiary hearing.   After this\n\nevidentiary hearing, the defendant did not request another\n\nhearing in his motion for reconsideration.   Thus, the motion\n\njudge concluded that another hearing was unnecessary and adopted\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s version of the facts.\n\f                                                                  36\n\n\n     Where the trial court had already conducted an evidentiary\n\nhearing, and where the defendant made no request for another, it\n\nwould have been &quot;fair to conclude that the defendant was\n\nproceeding on the facts from the existing . . . record.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Pimental, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 333 (2002).      In\n\nany event, the motion judge properly exercised his discretion in\n\ndetermining that another hearing was unwarranted, as he could\n\nhave reasonably concluded that the briefing and documents before\n\nhim &quot;were sufficient to allow him to reach an informed\n\ndecision.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Barry, 481 Mass. 388, 401 (2019).\n\n     i.   Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.   Finally, we have\n\nreviewed the entire record and discern no basis upon which to\n\nexercise our extraordinary authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.12\n\n     3.   Conclusion.   For the reasons stated, the defendant&#x27;s\n\nconvictions of murder in the first degree and armed assault with\n\nintent to rob are affirmed.   The trial court&#x27;s orders denying\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s motion for a new trial and the defendant&#x27;s\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the same are likewise affirmed.\n\n\n     12To the extent we do not discuss other arguments made by\nthe defendant (including arguments on duplicative convictions,\nan alleged error in the jury instruction on felony-murder in the\nsecond degree, alleged ambiguities between the attempted\ncommission of armed robbery and the commission of armed assault\nwith intent to rob, the alleged irrelevance of certain\nphotographic evidence, and omissions from Detective Kenney&#x27;s\nsearch warrant affidavit), they &quot;have not been overlooked. We\nfind nothing in them that requires discussion.&quot; See\nCommonwealth v. Domanski, 332 Mass. 66, 78 (1954).\n\f                                                                 37\n\n\nWe vacate and set aside the conviction of unlawful possession of\n\nammunition and remand to the Superior Court for a new trial on\n\nthe unlawful possession indictment.\n\n                                   So ordered.\n\f",
