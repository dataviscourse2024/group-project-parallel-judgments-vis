WRIT ANNULLED; AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n       Mark C. Smith, State Appellate Defender, and Robert P Ranschau,\n\nAssistant Appellate Defender, for appellant.\n\n       Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, Alexandra Link, Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, Carlyle Dalen, County Attorney, and R. Blake Norman, Assistant\n\nCounty Attorney, for appellee.\n\n\n\n       Considered by Vaitheswaran, P.J., Mullins, J., and Mahan, S.J.*\n\n       *Senior judge assigned by order pursuant to Iowa Code section 602.9206 (2015).\n\f                                           2\n\n\nMAHAN, S.J.\n\n       Bernard Jamal Ware appeals the judgment imposed on his criminal\n\nconvictions and contempt findings.1 Because appeal cannot be taken from a\n\ncontempt punishment, Ware requests we consider the portion of this appeal\n\nconcerning the contempt findings a certiorari action. See Iowa Code \u00a7 665.11\n\n(2013).\n\n       Ware contends the district court abused its discretion by imposing\n\nconsecutive prison and jail terms rather than suspending judgment as the\n\nprosecutor and presentence investigation report recommended.               In imposing\n\njudgment, the district court must determine how to best provide for the\n\ndefendant\u2019s rehabilitation and the community\u2019s protection. State v. Knight, 701\n\nN.W.2d 83, 86 (Iowa 2005). In making this determination, it considers the nature\n\nof the offense; attending circumstances; and defendant\u2019s age, character,\n\npropensities, and chances of reform. State v. Leckington, 713 N.W.2d 208, 216\n\n(Iowa 2006). The court must state its reasoning on the record to demonstrate it\n\nexercised discretion. State v. Thomas, 547 N.W.2d 223, 225 (Iowa 1996). The\n\ncourt abuses its discretion only when it acts on grounds clearly untenable or to\n\nan extent clearly unreasonable. Id.\n\n       In imposing judgment, the court listed the factors it considered, including\n\nWare\u2019s age, prior criminal history, family, and employment. It cited the \u201cvery\n\n\n\n1\n  Ware pled guilty to willful injury, solicitation of an aggravated misdemeanor, and\ndomestic abuse assault, second offense. He was sentenced to consecutive prison\nterms of five years, two years, and one year, respectively. Ware also stipulated to eight\nalleged violations of a no-contact order issued in the domestic abuse assault case and\nwas found in contempt. He was ordered to serve 180 days in jail for each violation, with\nthe jail terms to run consecutively to each other and to the prison sentences.\n\f                                         3\n\n\nserious\u201d nature of the offenses Ware had committed, two of which involved acts\n\nof violence, and found the eight violations of the no-contact order \u201cshow a\n\ndemonstrated inability to follow the simplest of rules.\u201d The court also noted the\n\nsolicitation charge involved \u201ctry[ing] to tamper with the witness in one of [the]\n\ncases, which . . . not only demonstrates [Ware\u2019s] lack of respect for [the] system,\n\nbut also for the victim of that case and for the process.\u201d The court then referred\n\nto Ware\u2019s numerous convictions for interference with official acts, three prior\n\ncontempt findings, and domestic-abuse-assault and theft convictions before\n\nexercising its discretion to impose the sentences and punishment for contempt.\n\n       Ware also contends there is insufficient evidence to support the finding\n\nbecause although he stipulated to eight violations of the no-contact order, there\n\nis no evidence to show he willfully violated it. See Opat v. Ludeking, 666 N.W.2d\n\n597, 607 (Iowa 2003) (noting a contempt finding requires proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that an individual willfully violated a court order or decree).\n\nWillfulness is established if there is proof of intentional and deliberate conduct\n\nundertaken contrary to a known duty. Id. at 607-08.\n\n       Substantial evidence shows Ware willfully violated the no-contact order.\n\nThe order states it \u201cshall remain in effect until modified or terminated by further\n\nwritten order of the court, until the case is dismissed, or until sentencing.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ware claims the protected party told him the no-contact order was\n\n\u201cover,\u201d he admitted he failed to investigate its status, evidencing a disregard for a\n\nknown duty. Accordingly, we affirm Ware\u2019s sentence and the punishment for\n\ncontempt, and annul the writ challenging the contempt findings.\n\n       WRIT ANNULLED; AFFIRMED.\n\f",
