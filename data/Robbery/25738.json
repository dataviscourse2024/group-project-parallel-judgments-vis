Finding that the sentence is not inappropriate, we affirm.\n\n\n[2]   On December 2, 2015, a confidential informant working with law enforcement\n\n      in Vigo County conducted a controlled buy of methamphetamine from Allen at\n\n      his home. On December 10, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Allen\u2019s\n\n      home, during which they found methamphetamine, marijuana, alprazolam, a\n\n      glass smoking pipe, and several firearms. Allen\u2019s toddler son was home at the\n\n      time.\n\n\n[3]   On December 14, 2015, the State charged Allen under cause number 84D01-\n\n      1512-F2-3063 (F2-3063)2 with the following: Level 2 felony dealing in\n\n      methamphetamine, Level 3 felony possession of methamphetamine, Level 4\n\n      felony dealing in a controlled substance, Level 5 felony neglect of a dependent,\n\n      two counts of Level 6 felony maintaining a common nuisance, two counts of\n\n      Level 6 felony theft of a firearm, Level 6 felony dealing in marijuana, Class B\n\n      misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and Class A misdemeanor possession of\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        In Allen\u2019s plea agreement, he agreed to waive the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this matter. At\n      the sentencing hearing, however, the trial court advised Allen that he had a right to appeal his sentence\n      because there was no agreement as to the sentence. Tr. p. 13. Neither Allen\u2019s counsel nor the State objected\n      to the trial court\u2019s statement. The State is not challenging Allen\u2019s right to appeal his sentence.\n      2\n          These offenses stem from the December 10, 2015, search of Allen\u2019s residence.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 84A04-1702-CR-406 | July 31, 2017               Page 2 of 5\n\f      paraphernalia. The State filed a notice of intent to seek two firearm\n\n      enhancements for the charge of Level 4 felony dealing in a controlled\n\n      substance.\n\n\n[4]   On January 27, 2016, the State charged Allen under cause number 84D01-1601-\n\n      F4-218 (F4-218)3 with the following: Level 4 felony dealing in\n\n      methamphetamine, Level 6 felony possession of methamphetamine, and Level\n\n      6 felony maintaining a common nuisance.\n\n\n[5]   On January 25, 2017, Allen pleaded guilty to Level 2 felony dealing in\n\n      methamphetamine, Level 3 felony possession of methamphetamine, and Level\n\n      6 felony theft of a firearm under cause F2-3063, and to Level 4 felony dealing in\n\n      methamphetamine under cause F4-218. Under the plea agreement, the State\n\n      agreed to dismiss all remaining charges. The plea agreement provided that all\n\n      sentences would run concurrently, and it capped the aggregate sentence at\n\n      twenty years. At the January 25, 2017, sentencing hearing, the trial court\n\n      merged Allen\u2019s Level 3 felony possession of methamphetamine conviction into\n\n      the Level 2 felony dealing in methamphetamine to prevent double jeopardy\n\n      concerns. The trial court imposed a twenty-year sentence for his Level 2\n\n      conviction, an eight-year sentence for his Level 4 conviction, and a two-year\n\n      sentence for his Level 6 conviction, all to run concurrently, for an aggregate\n\n      sentence of twenty years.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          These offenses stem from the December 2, 2015, controlled buy.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 84A04-1702-CR-406 | July 31, 2017   Page 3 of 5\n\f[6]   Allen\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the sentence is inappropriate in light of\n\n      the nature of the offenses and his character. Indiana Appellate Rule 7(B)\n\n      provides that this Court may revise a sentence if it is inappropriate in light of\n\n      the nature of the offense and the character of the offender. We must \u201cconduct\n\n      [this] review with substantial deference and give \u2018due consideration\u2019 to the trial\n\n      court's decision\u2014since the \u2018principal role of [our] review is to attempt to leaven\n\n      the outliers,\u2019 and not to achieve a perceived \u2018correct\u2019 sentence . . . . \u201d Knapp v.\n\n      State, 9 N.E.3d 1274, 1292 (Ind. 2014) (quoting Chambers v. State, 989 N.E.2d\n\n      1257, 1259 (Ind. 2013)) (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n[7]   Allen pleaded guilty to Level 2 felony dealing in methamphetamine, Level 4\n\n      felony dealing in methamphetamine, and Level 6 felony theft of a firearm. For\n\n      his Level 2 conviction, he faced a term of ten to thirty years, with an advisory\n\n      term of seventeen and one-half years imprisonment. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-50-2-4.5.\n\n      For his Level 4 conviction, he faced a term of two to twelve years\n\n      imprisonment, with an advisory term of six years imprisonment. I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-\n\n      5.5. For his Level 6 conviction, he faced a term of six months to two and one-\n\n      half years, with an advisory term of one year imprisonment. I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-7.\n\n      Allen received an aggregate executed twenty-year sentence.\n\n\n[8]   Initially, we note that Allen agreed to enter into a plea agreement that provided\n\n      that he could receive a maximum sentence of twenty years. The trial court\n\n      imposed a twenty-year sentence, as contemplated by the plea agreement, and\n\n      because Allen agreed to this sentence, he cannot now argue that it was\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 84A04-1702-CR-406 | July 31, 2017   Page 4 of 5\n\f       inappropriate. His agreement notwithstanding, we will still discuss his\n\n       argument.\n\n\n[9]    As for the nature of the offense, Allen possessed and intended to deal\n\n       methamphetamine. He committed theft of a firearm. While these offenses are\n\n       not the worst of the worst, Allen put his young child in harm\u2019s way by\n\n       conducting his activities in the presence of and within close proximity to his\n\n       child.\n\n\n[10]   As for Allen\u2019s character, he has a lengthy history of contact with the criminal\n\n       justice system. As a teenager, he was committed to the Indiana Boys\u2019 School\n\n       four times. As an adult, he has had six felony convictions, including two\n\n       convictions for Class D felony possession of cocaine, Class D felony possession\n\n       of methamphetamine, Class D felony possession of marijuana, and Class C\n\n       felony possession of methamphetamine. In addition, he has had ten\n\n       misdemeanor convictions, including convictions for domestic battery,\n\n       possession of marijuana, and resisting law enforcement.\n\n\n[11]   Given the nature of the offenses and Allen\u2019s character, including a lengthy\n\n       history of contact with the criminal justice system that has not deterred him\n\n       from continuing to commit crimes, we do not find the sentence imposed by the\n\n       trial court to be inappropriate.\n\n\n[12]   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n       Barnes, J., and Crone, J., concur.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 84A04-1702-CR-406 | July 31, 2017   Page 5 of 5\n\f",
