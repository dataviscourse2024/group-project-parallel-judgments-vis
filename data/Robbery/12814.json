The victim testified a man identified by others as defendant pointed a revolver at\nhim, threatened him, and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire.

He\nalso contends his admission of his prior convictions was invalid. We affirm.\n                                               I. BACKGROUND\n         Defendant was charged in an information, filed December 16, 2010, with\nattempted second degree robbery (Pen. Code,1 \u00a7 211) and possession of a firearm by a\nfelon (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)). As to the attempted robbery charge, it was alleged\ndefendant personally discharged a firearm, causing great bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5,\n\n\n         1\n             All statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\fsubd. (a), 12022.7, subd. (a), 12022.53, subds. (b), (c), (d), (g)), personally inflicted great\nbodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(8), 12022.7, subd. (a)), and committed the offense\nwhile on parole (\u00a7 1203.085, subd. (b)). Defendant was also alleged to have a prior strike\nand serious felony conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (a)(1), (e)(1), 1170.12, subd. (c)(1)) and\nfour other felony convictions for which he served prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).\n         The victim testified he was selling ice cream from a pushcart around noon on the\nday of the attempted robbery. Three people, one later identified by other witnesses as\ndefendant, walked up to the cart. Defendant said he wanted to buy ice cream. The two\nothers moved to surround the victim. After the victim gave defendant ice cream,\ndefendant took a revolver from his pocket, pointed it at the victim\u2019s face, and said, \u201cYou\nknow what? I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d When the victim asked why, defendant pulled the\ntrigger of the revolver, but the weapon did not fire.\n         The victim then grabbed the wrist of the hand holding the gun. As the pair\nstruggled, the gun fired, this time sending a bullet through the brim of the victim\u2019s cap.\nDefendant pushed the victim against the cart, causing him to fall to the ground. As the\nvictim tried to pull himself up, defendant moved behind him and shot him in the\nshoulder. When the victim slumped to the ground, defendant pushed him over and\nsearched his pockets before walking off.\n         The victim\u2019s statement to the police, dictated during his stay in the hospital after\nthe shooting, differed somewhat from his testimony at trial. The statement made no\nreference to an initial trigger pull that did not result in the gun firing. Instead, the victim\nsaid he \u201cgrabbed the gun and struggled with the male suspect. All of sudden [sic] I heard\ntwo shots, and then a sharp pain near my neck. I then fell to the ground knowing I was\nshot.\u201d\n         Although the victim was unable to identify the shooter, a pair of witnesses saw the\nshooting from a distance, identified defendant as the shooter, and followed him and the\ntwo others as they went into a nearby park restroom. When the three emerged, defendant\nbegan playing basketball on a nearby court. He was arrested there. Police found a\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\frevolver in a trash can near the restroom. The cylinder of the revolver contained one\nempty chamber, two expended bullet cartridges, and two live cartridges.\n       The jury convicted defendant on both counts and found the allegations to be true.\nThe trial court imposed a sentence of 34 years to life in prison.\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in not giving a unanimity instruction with\nrespect to the section 12022.53 enhancement allegation, failed to respond to a jury\nrequest, and improperly refused to appoint substitute counsel. He also contends his\nadmission was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding he suffered the prior\nconvictions alleged in the information.\nA. Unanimity Instruction\n       Defendant argues the jury could have concluded the section 12022.53 allegation,\nrequiring an intentional discharge of a firearm, was supported either by the initial trigger-\npull, which defendant incorrectly characterizes as a \u201cmisfire,\u201d or the subsequent shot that\nsent a bullet into the victim\u2019s shoulder.2 He contends the jury was required to agree on\nwhich of these alternatives was the factual predicate for its finding the allegation true and\nseeks reversal because the trial court failed to give a unanimity instruction.\n       \u201cIn a criminal case, a jury verdict must be unanimous. [Citations.] . . .\nAdditionally, the jury must agree unanimously the defendant is guilty of a specific crime.\n[Citation.] Therefore, cases have long held that when the evidence suggests more than\none discrete crime, either the prosecution must elect among the crimes or the court must\nrequire the jury to agree on the same criminal act. [Citations.] [\u00b6] This requirement of\n\n       2\n         Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the initial trigger pull would not have\nsupported an enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d), which requires the\nintentional \u201cdischarge\u201d of a firearm. While a firearm need not emit a bullet in order to\nhave been \u201cdischarged,\u201d some type of ignition must occur in the firing chamber. (People\nv. Grandy (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 33, 42\u201343.) A mere trigger pull is analogous to the\ndisplay of an unloaded or inoperable firearm, which qualifies only as the \u201cuse\u201d of a\nfirearm under section 12022.53, subdivision (b). (Grandy, at p. 42.) Although we do not\naccept the premise asserted by defendant for his argument, we nonetheless consider it\nbecause there is no question more than one \u201cdischarge\u201d of the revolver occurred.\n\n\n                                              3\n\funanimity as to the criminal act \u2018is intended to eliminate the danger that the defendant\nwill be convicted even though there is no single offense which all the jurors agree the\ndefendant committed.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Russo (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1124, 1132 (Russo).) While\nthe jury must agree on which crime defendant committed, there is no similar rule\nregarding the manner in which the crime was committed. \u201c[W]here the evidence shows\nonly a single discrete crime but leaves room for disagreement as to exactly how that\ncrime was committed or what the defendant\u2019s precise role was, the jury need not\nunanimously agree on the basis or, as the cases often put it, the \u2018theory\u2019 whereby the\ndefendant is guilty.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       No unanimity instruction was required here because there was no evidence of\nmore than one criminal event. As noted above, the constitutional requirement of\nunanimity applies when \u201cthe evidence at trial indicates that the defendant committed\nmore than one \u2018 \u201cdiscrete criminal event.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Quiroz (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th\n65, 73.) \u201cWhere the evidence suggests that the defendant might have committed more\nthan one crime, the court must instruct the jury that it must agree on which of the acts\u2014\nand, hence, which of the crimes\u2014the defendant committed.\u201d (Ibid.) In contrast, a\nunanimity instruction is not required \u201c \u2018when the acts alleged are so closely connected as\nto form part of one transaction.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Benavides (2005) 35 Cal.4th 69, 98.) Here,\nonly one discrete criminal event was alleged and proven: defendant\u2019s attempt to rob the\nice cream vendor. All of the events about which evidence was presented at trial occurred\nwithin seconds of each other in a single, uninterrupted flow as part of that attempt. In\nparticular, each trigger pull by defendant occurred in the course of this single criminal\n\u201ctransaction.\u201d Because there was evidence of only one possible crime, the trial court was\nunder no duty to instruct on unanimity.\n       In truth, defendant\u2019s argument is not premised on the existence of more than one\ncriminal event but on the existence of more than one act to support the sentencing\nenhancement alleged in connection with this single crime. We are unaware of any case\nholding that unanimity is required with respect to the facts underlying an individual\nsentencing enhancement allegation, and defendant makes no argument for the imposition\n\n\n                                             4\n\fof such an unprecedented requirement. On the contrary, the facts underlying a sentencing\nenhancement allegation are, at bottom, the elements of \u201cexactly how th[e] crime was\ncommitted,\u201d an issue on which the jury need not agree. (Russo, supra, 25 Cal.4th at\np. 1132.)\nB. The Jury\u2019s Note\n       In the course of its deliberations on the morning of October 5, 2011, the jury sent a\nnote seeking clarification of the definition of \u201cdischarge\u201d for purposes of\nsection 12022.53. Citing the absence in the appellate record of any indication the trial\ncourt notified defense counsel of this note or responded to it, defendant argues the trial\ncourt failed in its \u201c \u2018mandatory duty\u2019 \u201d to respond to jury inquiries. (People v. Beardslee\n(1991) 53 Cal.3d 68, 96\u201397.)\n       Just as defendant argues, the appellate record is silent about the fate of the jury\u2019s\nnote. The trial court\u2019s minutes reflect the jury\u2019s sending of the note, but there is no\nindication in the minutes how or whether the note was addressed by the court and\ncounsel. Further, there is no reporter\u2019s transcript in the record of the proceedings on the\nmorning of October 5, despite the jury\u2019s deliberations that morning. The transcript for\nthat day does not commence until shortly after noon with the announcement the jury had\nreached a verdict.\n       Error by the court in the execution of its duties must be proven affirmatively in the\nrecord. (People v. Sullivan (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 524, 548.) \u201c[T]he defendant . . .\nbears the burden to provide a record on appeal which affirmatively shows that there was\nan error below, and any uncertainty in the record must be resolved against the defendant.\u201d\n(Id. at p. 549.) Mere silence by the record is not, in these circumstances, sufficient to\nsupport an affirmative conclusion the trial court failed to respond to the jury\u2019s notes.\nParticularly because the minutes are inconsistent in their treatment of earlier jury\ncommunications for which a transcript is available, the absence of a notation in the\nminutes that the trial court responded to this note does not permit an inference nothing\nwas done. To conclude affirmatively that no action was taken on the note would require\na reporter\u2019s transcription of the events in court that morning, showing receipt of the note\n\n\n                                              5\n\fand a subsequent absence of action. As noted above, there is no transcript in the record.\nIn its absence, we must presume the trial court properly performed its duties.3 (Sullivan,\nat p. 549.)\n       We note defendant\u2019s counsel states in his reply brief that he \u201canticipates the filing\nof a settled statement indicating that in unreported proceedings the court and counsel\ndiscussed the question but that the jury reached a verdict before a response to the\nquestion was provided.\u201d Counsel does not appear to have filed the promised settled\nstatement, and we cannot rely on his representation to resolve this issue. We note,\nhowever, that his representation highlights the risk of presuming nonaction solely on the\nbasis of a silent record.\nC. Marsden Issues\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to grant two requests to replace\nhis court-appointed attorney. (See generally People v. Marsden (1970) 2 Cal.3d 118\n(Marsden).)\n       The first challenged Marsden request was addressed in a hearing on July 7, 2011.\nDefendant told the court, \u201c[T]he more I try, the harder it is to communicate\u201d with\ncounsel. Although counsel had, most recently, met with defendant for two hours, he\nbelieved she adopted a \u201csassy attitude\u201d whenever he attempted to bring up issues of law.\nAn argument developed, during which they \u201ccuss[ed]\u201d at each other, which resulted in\ndefendant telling counsel to \u201cleave.\u201d In particular, defendant was frustrated because\ncounsel repeatedly asked him to \u201cwaive time\u201d to accommodate conflicts in her\nprofessional schedule. In addition, he was concerned counsel had failed to confer with\nhim regarding the preparation of his defense.\n       Counsel told the court she had over 30 years of experience as a criminal defense\nattorney. She explained she had twice asked defendant to agree to a waiver of time\n\n       3\n         Because the court reporter apparently was not asked to record the events\nsurrounding the trial court\u2019s handling of the jury note, it would have been better practice\nfor the court to make an oral record of the jury\u2019s question, any objections, and the\nultimate answer or the reason for any failure to answer when transcription resumed.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fbecause she had jury duty and was required to represent another client in trial. Counsel\nbelieved she had diligently pursued defendant\u2019s defense, evaluating discovery and\nconferring with the prosecution. She acknowledged she had disagreed with defendant\nabout certain legal issues and defendant had resisted her advice to accept the\nprosecution\u2019s plea offer. Despite those differences, counsel believed \u201cit\u2019s not going to be\na wonderful relationship, but I think we can get along nice.\u201d\n       The trial court denied the request, finding counsel more credible in describing the\nrelationship. The court initially told defendant he was lucky because his attorney was a\nvery experienced defense lawyer with a \u201cgreat reputation in the legal community.\u201d The\ncourt noted it had granted an earlier Marsden request by defendant because his\nrelationship with that attorney \u201chad totally broken down,\u201d but the court said it did not\n\u201csee a problem here.\u201d Although the court recognized counsel might have \u201craise[d] her\nvoice\u201d in speaking with defendant, it concluded that alone was insufficient to justify\ncounsel\u2019s replacement.\n       The second hearing occurred near the close of defendant\u2019s case at trial, on\nOctober 3, 2011. Defense counsel had told the court she and defendant were \u201cdebating\nwhether he wants to testify or not.\u201d After discussion of the admissibility of defendant\u2019s\nprior convictions should he testify, counsel said defendant \u201cis now asking to address the\nCourt without [the prosecutor] in the audience.\u201d The court asked whether \u201cit deals with\nyour relationship between you and your attorney,\u201d defendant responded affirmatively,\nand the court excused the prosecutor. Defendant opened the closed hearing by telling the\ncourt counsel continued to act unprofessionally. The immediate impetus for the hearing\nwas counsel\u2019s snatching a pen from defendant\u2019s hand and calling him an \u201cidiot,\u201d at least\naccording to defendant\u2019s account of the events. Defendant was concerned that defense\ncounsel continued to get angry and use foul language, and he was upset that she refused\nto conduct the defense in the manner he preferred. He said she had threatened she would\ngive him a \u201clackluster defense.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       Counsel acknowledged becoming \u201cfrustrated\u201d with defendant, but she denied ever\nsaying she would provide a lackluster defense. Counsel explained that defendant \u201cwants\nto run the defense\u201d and \u201ctell me what to do.\u201d\n       The trial court told defendant it believed, based on its observations during trial,\ncounsel had \u201cdone everything that an attorney can do considering the kind of evidence\nthat the prosecution has in your case.\u201d The court explained to defendant the various\ntactical issues involved in his case and defense counsel\u2019s resolution of those issues,\nfocusing in particular on defendant\u2019s desire to testify in his own defense. It was only at\nthe conclusion of the court\u2019s discussion that it remarked, \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re making a\nMarsden motion. I\u2019m going to deny your motion.\u201d Defendant then told the court he\nwould \u201cwithdraw taking the stand.\u201d When open court resumed, the parties rested.\n       \u201c \u2018When a defendant seeks substitution of appointed counsel pursuant to\n[Marsden], \u201cthe trial court must permit the defendant to explain the basis of his\ncontention and to relate specific instances of inadequate performance. A defendant is\nentitled to relief if the record clearly shows that the appointed counsel is not providing\nadequate representation or that defendant and counsel have become embroiled in such an\nirreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018A\ntrial court should grant a defendant\u2019s Marsden motion only when the defendant has made\n\u201ca substantial showing that failure to order substitution is likely to result in\nconstitutionally inadequate representation.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] \u2018We review the denial of a\nMarsden motion for abuse of discretion.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Denial is not an abuse of\ndiscretion \u201cunless the defendant has shown that a failure to replace counsel would\nsubstantially impair the defendant\u2019s right to assistance of counsel.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v.\nStreeter (2012) 54 Cal.4th 205, 230.)\n       Defendant contends the July 7 Marsden request was improperly denied because in\ndoing so the trial court \u201crelied in large measure on its knowledge of counsel\u2019s\nreputation.\u201d We find no support in the record for the premise of defendant\u2019s claim. As\ndiscussed above, the trial court rejected the Marsden request because, after hearing from\nboth defendant and counsel, it concluded the disagreements between them had not\n\n\n                                               8\n\freached a level of hostility that would impair counsel\u2019s representation. In doing so, the\ncourt cited the proper legal standard, which it had applied in granting an earlier Marsden\nrequest by defendant, and expressly noted that relations between defendant and his\nattorney had not reached a sufficient level of discord to justify substitution. Although the\ncourt mentioned counsel\u2019s experience and reputation, these were cited not as a reason for\ndenying the Marsden request but rather as an attempt to mollify defendant\u2019s\ndissatisfaction with counsel.\n       In arguing error, defendant relies on People v. Hill (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 744, in\nwhich the trial court summarily denied a Marsden request on the basis of off-the-record\ndiscussions with the defense attorney, prior attorneys for defendant, and the director of\nthe private defender program. The court said it was denying the request because it had\n\u201cconfidence\u201d in defense counsel and believed no attorney would give defendant different\nadvice on the issues in dispute. (Hill, at p. 750.) The Court of Appeal found error\nbecause the trial court improperly relied on its prior experience with the attorney rather\nthan inquiring from counsel in the hearing about the various issues raised by defendant in\nseeking new counsel. (Id. at pp. 753\u2013755.)\n       The situation here was quite different. Most important, the trial court did not deny\nthe motion summarily, on the basis of its prior experience. Instead, the court gave\ndefendant a full opportunity to express his concerns, asked defense counsel to respond,\nand denied the motion on the basis of its conclusions about the relationship between\ndefendant and counsel, based on the evidence presented during the Marsden hearing. As\nnoted, its comments about counsel\u2019s reputation were not made to justify its ruling on the\nMarsden request but in an effort to reconcile defendant with his attorney.\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in handling the October 3 hearing because\nit failed to inquire adequately into his relations with counsel. We find no violation of\nMarsden for two reasons. First, there is no indication defendant had made a formal\nrequest to replace counsel, thereby triggering the Marsden requirements. A trial court\u2019s\nduties under Marsden do not accrue unless \u201cthere is \u2018at least some clear indication by\ndefendant,\u2019 either personally or through his current counsel, that defendant \u2018wants a\n\n\n                                             9\n\fsubstitute attorney.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Sanchez (2011) 53 Cal.4th 80, 90 (Sanchez).) In\nSanchez, the Supreme Court disapproved earlier cases holding that Marsden duties can be\ntriggered by \u201csomething less than a clear indication\u201d that the defendant wanted a new\nattorney.4 (Sanchez, at p. 90, fn. 3.)\n       The October 3 hearing occurred as a result of defendant\u2019s displeasure when his\nattorney took a pen from his hand. Despite his evident dissatisfaction with counsel,\ndefendant did not mention replacing her. That issue was not raised until the end of the\nhearing, and it was raised by the court rather than by defendant or his attorney. Further,\nthere would have been little point in requesting new counsel at that stage of the trial, at\nthe close of evidence. Because there is no clear indication in the record defendant wanted\na new attorney, the trial court was under no duty to conduct a Marsden inquiry.\n       Even if the Marsden duties had accrued, we would find the court\u2019s conduct\nadequate. The trial court gave defendant an opportunity to air his grievances, asked\ndefense counsel to respond, and evaluated the information provided. Defendant\u2019s claims\nof conflict were well explored. While it was clear the tension of the trial had strained\nrelations between defendant and counsel, a lack of trust or difficulty in getting along do\nnot alone justify appointing substitute counsel. (People v. Jackson (2009) 45 Cal.4th\n662, 688.) Because there is no indication in the record either of inadequate representation\nor \u201c \u2018 \u201csuch an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result,\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Streeter, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 230), we find no abuse of discretion.\nD. Defendant\u2019s Prior Convictions\n       Defendant contends his admission of his prior felony convictions was not knowing\nand voluntary and he did not admit all the elements of a prior prison term enhancement.\n       The information alleged defendant had been convicted of second degree robbery\non June 14, 2007, which qualified as a serious felony conviction and a prior strike\n\n\n\n       4\n        One of the cases expressly disapproved by Sanchez, People v. Eastman (2007)\n146 Cal.App.4th 688, is cited as authority in defendant\u2019s opening brief without\nacknowledgement of its disapproved status.\n\n\n                                               10\n\fconviction. In addition, it alleged defendant had four prior prison term convictions for\nsecond degree burglary, all on July 21, 2008.\n       At a hearing a week before trial, prior to addressing motions in limine, the court\ndiscussed the alleged prior convictions. The court noted defendant had been \u201cconvicted\nof a robbery in 2007\u201d and explained the conviction\u2019s potential effect on his sentence. In\nthe course of the discussion, defendant acknowledged having read section 213,\nsubdivision (b), the statute governing robbery sentencing, causing the court to respond,\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing your homework, then.\u201d The court then noted \u201cthey say there\u2019s four\nprior convictions for second-degree burglary, and in each of those it says you went to\nprison\u201d and explained \u201cthat could add possibly one more year to your sentence.\u201d In\nconcluding, the court reviewed the possible sentences defendant could receive in\nconnection with each count and enhancement allegation.\n       During subsequent argument of a motion in limine, the prosecutor asked that\nevidence of the prior felony convictions be admitted to prove the felon-in-possession\ncount. Defendant thereafter admitted \u201cthe prior convictions\u201d solely for \u201cthe purpose of\nsanitizing [section] 12021.\u201d He declined to admit the convictions \u201cfor all purposes,\u201d\ndeferring a decision whether to admit any or all of the prior convictions for purposes of\nthe sentencing enhancements.\n       During jury deliberations, the court raised the issue of trial on the prior\nconvictions. Defendant waived jury trial on the convictions, but he declined to decide\nwhether he would admit them.\n       After notification the jury had reached a verdict, the court attempted to schedule a\ntrial on defendant\u2019s prior convictions. During a discussion of dates, defense counsel told\nthe court defendant would admit the convictions. Without reviewing the specific details\nof the alleged prior convictions, the court explained to defendant, \u201cThe court trial will be\nwhere [the prosecutor] proves\u2014tries to prove beyond a reasonable doubt whether or not\nyou are the person who suffered the prior for robbery, and there\u2019s four second-degree\nburglaries that you went to prison on. He\u2019s provided me with some documents.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fDefendant agreed to admit the prior convictions, saying, \u201cI just don\u2019t see how I can beat a\nrap sheet.\u201d The court then found a knowing and voluntary waiver of his trial right.\n       The court ultimately imposed a sentence enhancement on the basis of the prior\nstrike/serious felony conviction, but it stayed sentence on the felon-in-possession count\nand declined to increase defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of the prior prison terms.\n       Disregarding the events at the pretrial hearing, defendant argues he could not have\ngiven an informed waiver of his right to trial on the prior robbery conviction because\nneither the court nor counsel identified the date or court of the conviction, nor did they\ninform defendant that he was admitting a strike and serious felony conviction. In fact, at\nthe pretrial hearing the court did review with defendant the year, if not the specific date,\nof the robbery conviction and explained to defendant the impact on sentencing of the\nconviction, using both terms \u201cstrike\u201d and \u201cserious felony.\u201d Because we evaluate the\ninformed nature of a defendant\u2019s waiver on the basis of the entire record, taking into\nconsideration defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system (People v.\nMosby (2004) 33 Cal.4th 353, 365), the discussions from the earlier hearing can be\nconsidered to demonstrate defendant was aware of the nature and implications of his\nadmission. Although, as defendant notes, the court did not specify the exact date or court\nof the conviction, no case holds this level of detail to be necessary. There is no reason to\nbelieve defendant would have admitted having been convicted of robbery in 2007 if, in\nfact, he was not convicted of robbery in that year.\n       With respect to the prior prison terms allegations, defendant contends his\nadmission was invalid because the court did not specifically describe the convictions and\ndid not ask him to admit the remaining elements of a section 667.5 sentencing\nenhancement\u2014serving and completing separate prison terms less than five years earlier.\n(See People v. Tenner (1993) 6 Cal.4th 559, 563.)\n       The validity of the prior prison term admissions is, as a practical matter, moot\nbecause the trial court declined to impose a sentence enhancement on the basis of the\nprior terms. Because the trial court took no action on the basis of defendant\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fadmissions, there is no practical relief we could grant if we found them inadequate. (Simi\nCorp. v. Garamendi (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1503.)\n       Even if the issue were not moot, we would find the prison term admissions valid\nand adequate to support imposition of the enhancement. The court referred at the pretrial\nhearing to \u201cfour prior convictions for second-degree burglary\u201d for each of which \u201cyou\nwent to prison.\u201d Although the court did not mention the date of these convictions, the\nspecificity of four second degree burglary convictions was sufficient to identify them for\ndefendant. His admission of the fact of the convictions and their associate prison terms\nalso constituted an admission of their date of commission, which was pleaded in the\ninformation. (See People v. Ebner (1966) 64 Cal.2d 297, 303.) The trial court was\nentitled to infer from these admissions the remaining elements of section 667.5,\nsubdivision (b), that defendant had completed the terms and that they were completed\nless than five years earlier. Because the convictions dated from 2008, they necessarily\nwere completed less than five years before the 2010 occurrence of the crime. (See\nPeople v. Tenner, supra, 6 Cal.4th at pp. 565\u2013566.)\n                                   III.
