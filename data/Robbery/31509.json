            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nCiparick, J.\nOn this appeal, we consider for the first time whether a plaintiffs claim against a Web site operator arising out of allegedly defamatory comments posted to the Web site is barred by the Communications Decency Act (CDA), codified at 47 USC \u00a7 230. We conclude that it is, and that the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint was properly granted.\nAs stated in the complaint, plaintiff Christakis Shiamili is the founder and CEO of Ardor Realty Corp. (Ardor), a New York apartment rental and sales company. In March 2008, Shiamili filed this action for defamation and unfair competition by disparagement against defendants The Real Estate Group of New York, Inc. (TREGNY), Daniel Baum, and Ryan McCann. TREGNY is a competitor of Ardor\u2019s, also engaged in selling and renting New York City apartments; Baum is TREGNY\u2019s principal and chief operating officer; and McCann is Baum\u2019s assistant.\nThese defendants allegedly \u201cadminister and choose content for\u201d a publicly accessible Web site \u2014 a \u201cblog\u201d \u2014 dedicated to the *285New York City real estate industry.1 In February 2008, defendants allegedly published defamatory statements about Shiamili on the Web site. Specifically, a lengthy comment was added to a discussion thread by a user operating under the pseudonym \u201cArdor Realty Sucks.\u201d The comment made several allegedly defamatory statements suggesting that Shiamili mistreated his employees and was racist and anti-Semitic, referring to one of the company\u2019s agents as \u201chis token Jew.\u201d McCann, in his role as Web site administrator, moved the comment to a stand-alone post, prefacing it with the statement that \u201cthe following story came to us as a . . . comment, and we promoted it to a post.\u201d The post was given the heading, \u201cArdor Realty and Those People,\u201d and the subheading, \u201cand now it\u2019s time for your weekly dose of hate, brought to you unedited, once again, by \u2018Ardor Realty Sucks\u2019, and for the record, we are so. not. afraid.\u201d The post was accompanied by a traditional image of Jesus Christ with Shiamili\u2019s face and the words \u201cChris Shiamili: King of the Token Jews.\u201d\nSeveral of the comments posted by anonymous users in the ensuing discussion thread contained further allegedly defamatory statements, including suggestions that Ardor was in financial trouble and that Shiamili abused and cheated on his wife. One of the commentators ended by saying \u201ccall me a Liar and I\u2019ll come back here and get REALLY specific.\u201d The complaint alleges that McCann, under a pseudonym, responded, \u201cliar\u201d in an attempt to encourage the user to say more, but that commentator did not post further. Shiamili responded by drafting a lengthy comment, which was added to the discussion thread. Shiamili also contacted McCann and requested that he remove the defamatory statements, but McCann refused to do so.\nShiamili brought this action, alleging in his complaint that the defamatory statements were made with the intent to injure his reputation, and that defendants either \u201cmade\u201d or published the statements. In addition to damages, the complaint requests injunctive relief requiring defendants to stop \u201cpublication of any and all defamatory statements concerning Shiamili and Ardor\u201d and \u201cany further disparagement.\u201d\n*286Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action (CPLR 3211 [a] [7]). In support of the motion, McCann submitted an affidavit acknowledging that he was the \u201cadministrator and moderator\u201d of the Web site, which \u201cfunctioned as a virtual bulletin board, or open discussion forum\u201d to which anyone could add content in the form of a comment on an existing post. Only McCann, in his role as moderator, could create stand-alone posts capable of generating their own discussion threads.\nSupreme Court denied the motion to dismiss. As relevant here, it found that section 230 (c) (1) of the CDA (47 USC \u00a7 230 [c] [1]) did not require dismissal of plaintiffs claims, since \u201cinformation as to defendants\u2019 role, if any, in authoring or developing the content of the website is exclusively within their possession\u201d and discovery had not yet occurred (2008 NY Slip Op 33479[U], *7).\nThe Appellate Division unanimously reversed, granted the motion to dismiss, and dismissed the complaint. The court explained that the CDA protects Web site operators from liability derived from the exercise of a publisher\u2019s traditional editorial functions (see Shiamili v Real Estate Group of N.Y., Inc., 68 AD3d 581, 583 [1st Dept 2009]). Because the complaint here does not allege that defendants authored the defamatory content, but only that they published and edited it, the court concluded that the CDA bars Shiamili\u2019s claim and that further discovery is unnecessary (see id.). We granted Shiamili leave to appeal (15 NY3d 705 [2010]) and now affirm.\nAlthough a publisher of defamatory material authored by a third party is generally subject to tort liability, Congress has carved out an exception for Internet publication by enacting section 230 of the CDA, passed as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Pub L 104-104, 110 US Stat 56 [104th Cong, 2d Sess, Feb. 8, 1996]). Section 230 establishes that \u201c[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [c] [1]), and it preempts any state law \u2014 including imposition of tort liability \u2014 inconsistent with its protections (see 47 USC \u00a7 230 [e] [3]). A defendant is therefore immune from state law liability if (1) it is a \u201cprovider or user of an interactive computer service\u201d; (2) the complaint seeks to hold the defendant liable as a \u201cpublisher or speaker\u201d; and (3) the action is based on \u201cinformation provided by another information content provider\u201d (47 *287USC \u00a7 230 [c] [1]; see also Federal Trade Commn. v Accusearch Inc., 570 F3d 1187, 1196 [10th Cir 2009]; Barnes v Yahoo!, Inc., 570 F3d 1096, 1100-1101 [9th Cir 2009]; Universal Communication Sys., Inc. v Lycos, Inc., 478 F3d 413, 418 [1st Cir 2007]). The statute defines an \u201cinformation content provider\u201d as \u201cany person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [f] [3]).2\nIn passing section 230, Congress acknowledged that \u201c[t]he Internet . . . offer [s] a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [a] [3]), and that it has \u201cflourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [a] [4]). Further, \u201c[i]t is the policy of the United States ... to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [b] [2]). As the Fourth Circuit explained in the seminal case of Zeran v America Online, Inc. (129 F3d 327, 330 [1997]):\n\u201cCongress recognized the threat that tort-based lawsuits pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning Internet medium. The imposition of tort liability on service providers for the communications of others represented, for Congress, simply another form of intrusive government regulation of speech. Section 230 was enacted, in part, to maintain the robust nature of Internet communication and, accordingly, to keep government interference in the medium to a minimum.\u201d\nAdditionally, section 230 was designed \u201cto encourage service providers to self-regulate the dissemination of offensive material over their services\u201d (id. at 331). In this respect, the statute was a response to cases such as Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v Prodigy Servs. Co. (1995 WL 323710, 1995 NY Misc LEXIS 229 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1995]), in which an Internet service provider was found liable for defamatory statements posted by third parties because it had voluntarily screened and edited some *288offensive content, and so was considered a \u201cpublisher\u201d (see 1995 WL 323710 at *4, 1995 NY Misc LEXIS 229 at *10-11; S Rep 104-230, 104th Cong, 2d Sess, at 194). Section 230 (c) (1) was meant to undo the perverse incentives created by this reasoning, which effectively penalized providers for monitoring content (see Zeran, 129 F3d at 331). Thus, section 230 has \u201ctwo parallel goals. The statute is designed at once \u2018to promote the free exchange of information and ideas over the Internet and to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive or obscene material\u2019 \u201d (Barnes, 570 F3d at 1099-1100, quoting Carafano v Metro-splash.com. Inc., 339 F3d 1119, 1122 [9th Cir 2003]).\nBoth state and federal courts around the country have \u201cgenerally interpreted Section 230 immunity broadly, so as to effectuate Congress\u2019s \u2018policy choice . . . not to deter harmful online speech through the . . . route of imposing tort liability on companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties\u2019 potentially injurious messages\u2019 \u201d (Universal Communication Sys., 478 F3d at 418, quoting Zeran, 129 F3d at 330-331; see also Johnson v Arden, 614 F3d 785, 791 [8th Cir 2010] [\u201cThe majority of federal circuits have interpreted the CDA to establish broad federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)]; Doe v My Space, Inc., 528 F3d 413, 418 [5th Cir 2008] [\u201cCourts have construed the immunity provisions in (section) 230 broadly in all cases arising from the publication of user-generated content\u201d]; Barrett v Rosenthal, 40 Cal 4th 33, 46, 146 P3d 510, 518 [2006] [noting that a broad reading of section 230 (c) (1) immunity has been \u201caccepted, in both federal and state courts\u201d]; Doe v America Online, Inc., 783 So 2d 1010, 1013, 26 Fla L Wkly S141 [2001] [adopting the reasoning in Zeran]). New York trial courts have also taken this view (see Reit v Yelp!, Inc., 29 Misc 3d 713, 716 [Sup Ct, NY County 2010]; Kuersteiner v Schrader, 2008 NY Slip Op 33614[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2008]).\nWe have not yet had occasion to address the scope of section 230\u2019s protections. In Lunney v Prodigy Servs. Co. (94 NY2d 242 [1999]), we took note of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Zeran and its robust understanding of CDA immunity as encompassing both publisher and distributor liability, but we left the decision whether to adopt that interpretation for another day (id. at 251). Today, we follow what may fairly be called the national consensus (see Barrett, 40 Cal 4th at 46 n 9, 146 P3d at 518 n 9 *289[citing cases]) and read section 230 as generally immunizing Internet service providers from liability for third-party content wherever such liability depends on characterizing the provider as a \u201cpublisher or speaker\u201d of objectionable material.\nConsistent with this view, we read section 230 to bar \u201clawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher\u2019s traditional editorial functions \u2014 such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, postpone or alter content\u201d (Zeran, 129 F3d at 330; see also Barnes, 570 F3d at 1102 [\u201cpublication involves reviewing, editing, and deciding whether to publish or to withdraw from publication third-party content\u201d]). Notably, the statute does not differentiate between \u201cneutral\u201d and selective publishers (see e.g. Batzel v Smith, 333 F3d 1018, 1031 [9th Cir 2003] [\u201cthe exclusion of \u2018publisher\u2019 liability necessarily precludes liability for exercising the usual prerogative of publishers to choose among proffered material and to edit the material published while retaining its basic form and message\u201d]; Blumenthal v Drudge, 992 F Supp 44, 52 [D DC 1998] [\u201cCongress has made a . . . policy choice by providing immunity even where the interactive service provider has an active, even aggressive role in making available content prepared by others\u201d]).\nService providers are only entitled to this broad immunity, however, where the content at issue is provided by \u201canother information content provider\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [c] [1]). It follows that if a defendant service provider is itself the \u201ccontent provider,\u201d it is not shielded from liability (see e.g. Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F3d 250, 254 [4th Cir 2009]; Fair Hous. Council of San Fernando Val. v Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F3d 1157, 1162 [9th Cir 2008]; Universal Communication Sys., 478 F3d at 419). Since a content provider is any party \u201cresponsible ... in part\u201d for the \u201ccreation or development of information\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [f] [3]), any piece of content can have multiple providers.\nIt may be difficult in certain cases to determine whether a service provider is also a content provider, particularly since the definition of \u201ccontent provider\u201d is so elastic, and no consensus has emerged concerning what conduct constitutes \u201cdevelopment\u201d:\n\u201c[T]he broadest sense of the term \u2018develop\u2019 could include the functions of an ordinary search engine\u2014 indeed, just about any function performed by a website. But to read the term so broadly would defeat *290the purposes of section 230 by swallowing up every bit of the immunity that the section otherwise provides. At the same time, reading the exception for co-developers as applying only to content that originates entirely with the website . . . ignores the words \u2018development ... in part\u2019 in the statutory passage\u201d (Roommates.Com, 521 F3d at 1167).\nThe Ninth\u2019s Circuit\u2019s approach, which Shiamili asks us to adopt, is to \u201cinterpret the term \u2018development\u2019 as referring not merely to augmenting the content generally, but to materially contributing to its alleged unlawfulness\u201d (id. at 1167-1168). This view, which has been cited with approval by the Tenth Circuit (see Accusearch Inc., 570 F3d at 1200), considers a Web site a content provider \u201cif it contributes materially to the alleged illegality of the conduct\u201d (Roommates.Com, 521 F3d at 1168).\nIn the case before us, we need not decide whether to apply the Ninth Circuit\u2019s relatively broad view of \u201cdevelopment\u201d since, even under that court\u2019s analysis, Shiamili\u2019s claim fails. Although the statements at issue are unquestionably offensive and obnoxious, defendants are nonetheless shielded from liability by section 230. Shiamili does not dispute that defendants, as alleged Web site operators, are providers of an \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d under section 230 (see Roommates.Com, 521 F3d at 1162 n 6 [\u201cthe most common interactive computer services are websites\u201d]; Universal Communication Sys., 478 F3d at 419 [\u201cweb site operators . . . are providers of interactive computer services within the meaning of Section 230\u201d]). Further, the claims here \u2014 defamation and unfair competition by disparagement \u2014 clearly seek to hold the defendants liable as publishers and speakers. The remaining question is whether, taking the facts alleged in the complaint as true, the defamatory statements were \u201cprovided by another information content provider\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [c] [1]).\nAs an initial matter, the complaint alleges that the defamatory statements were first posted by anonymous users; there is no allegation that defendants actually authored the statements. A Web site is generally not a \u201ccontent provider\u201d with respect to comments posted by third-party users (see DiMeo v Max, 248 Fed Appx 280, 282 [3d Cir 2007]). We reject Shiamili\u2019s contention that defendants should be deemed content providers because they created and ran a Web site which implicitly encouraged users to post negative comments about the New York City real estate industry. Creating an open forum for third parties to *291post content \u2014 including negative commentary \u2014 is at the core of what section 230 protects (see Accusearch Inc., 570 F3d at 1195 [noting that online message boards are \u201c(t)he prototypical service qualifying for (section 230) immunity\u201d]).\nMoreover, there is no allegation that the defamatory comments were posted in response to any specific invitation for users to bash Shiamili or Ardor (cf. Doctor\u2019s Assoc., Inc. v QIP Holder LLC, 2010 WL 669870, 2010 US Dist LEXIS 14687 [D Conn 2010]). Evidence submitted by Shiamili in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss indicates that the Web site had been operating for over a year before any of the comments that are the subject of this lawsuit were posted, and that the posted commentary spanned a range of topics. Even assuming that solicitation can constitute \u201cdevelopment,\u201d this is plainly not a case where the Web site can be charged with soliciting the defamatory content at issue. Nor can it be said that McCann\u2019s attempt at provoking further commentary in the Shiamili discussion thread is actionable, since none followed.\nThe defendants did not become \u201ccontent providers\u201d by virtue of moving one of the comments to its own post. Reposting content created and initially posted by a third party is well within \u201ca publisher\u2019s traditional editorial functions\u201d (Zeran, 129 F3d at 330). Indeed, this case is analogous to others in which service providers have been protected by section 230 after reposting or otherwise disseminating false information supplied by a third party. To cite only a few examples, in Ben Ezra, Weinstein, &amp; Co., Inc. v America Online Inc. (206 F3d 980 [10th Cir 2000]) the defendant service provider would publish updated securities information supplied by third parties and derived from a variety of stock exchanges and markets. Plaintiff sued the provider for publishing inaccurate information concerning the price and share volume of plaintiff\u2019s stock. The Tenth Circuit found that the inaccurate information was \u201ccreated\u201d by third parties, and the Web provider was not \u201cresponsible, in whole or in part, for [its] creation and development\u201d (id. at 986). The Ninth Circuit reached the same result in Batzel (333 F3d 1018), cited with approval in Roommates.Com (521 F3d at 1170). There, the editor of an e-mail newsletter received a tip and incorporated it into the newsletter, adding a headnote. The tip proved false, but the Ninth Circuit found that section 230 protected the editor from being sued for libel because he had been \u201cmerely editing portions of an e-mail and selecting material for publication\u201d (Batzel, 333 F3d at 1031). Similarly, in *292DiMeo (248 Fed Appx at 281)\u2014a case quite like this one\u2014the plaintiff sued for defamation based on comments left by anonymous users on defendant\u2019s Web site, where defendant could \u201cselect which posts to publish and edit[ed] their content\u201d (DiMeo v Max, 433 F Supp 2d 523, 530 [ED Pa 2006]). The Third Circuit found that \u201cthe website posts . . . constitute information furnished by third party information content providers\u201d (248 Fed Appx at 282).\nShiamili argues that this case fits within a line of federal decisions in which courts have found that \u201ceven if the data are supplied by third parties, a website operator may still contribute to the content\u2019s illegality and thus be liable as a developer\u201d of the content (Roommates.Com, 521 F3d at 1171; see also Accusearch Inc., 570 F3d at 1199). Those cases, however, are easily distinguishable. In Roommates.Com, the nonparties providing the data were required to post actionable material to the defendant Web site as a condition of use, and the Web site\u2019s \u201cwork in developing the discriminatory questions, discriminatory answers and discriminatory search mechanism [was] directly related to the alleged illegality of the site\u201d (521 F3d at 1172). Here, in contrast, there are no allegations that posting false and defamatory content was a condition of use, or that the site worked with users to develop the posted commentary. This case also differs considerably from Accusearch Inc., where the defendant Web site paid researchers to obtain information for the site to disseminate that \u201cwould almost inevitably require [the researcher] to violate the Telecommunications Act or to circumvent it by fraud or theft\u201d (570 F3d at 1192). There is no comparable allegation against these defendants.\nDefendants appear to have been \u201ccontent providers\u201d with respect to the heading, subheading, and illustration that accompanied the reposting. That content, however, is not defamatory as a matter of law. The complaint does not allege that the heading and subheading are actionable, but only that they \u201cpreceded\u201d and \u201cprefaced\u201d the objectionable commentary. The illustration that accompanied the post is alleged to be a \u201cfalse and defamatory statement[ ] of fact,\u201d but all it states is that Shiamili is \u201cKang of the Token Jews.\u201d This is not a defamatory statement, since no \u201creasonable reader could have concluded that [it was] conveying facts about the plaintiff\u2019 (Gross v New York Times Co., 82 NY2d 146, 152 [1993] [internal quotation marks and some brackets omitted]). The illustration was obviously satirical and, although offensive, it cannot by itself *293support Shiamili\u2019s claim of defamation. Nor, contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, does it \u201cdevelop\u201d or \u201ccontributef ] materially to the alleged illegality\u201d of the third-party content within the meaning of the CDA (dissenting op at 294).\nSimply put, the complaint alleges that defamatory statements were posted on defendants\u2019 Web site, and some of them were re-posted by the defendants. These statements are all \u201cinformation provided by another information content provider\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [c] [1]). Defendants\u2019 added headings and illustration do not materially contribute to the defamatory nature of the third-party statements. Shiamili has therefore failed to state a viable cause of action against defendants, as his claims for defamation and unfair competition by disparagement are clearly barred by the CDA and were properly dismissed below.\nAccordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.\n\n. Defendants maintain that only McCann administers the Web site. On this motion to dismiss, we accept plaintiffs allegation that \u201call McCann\u2019s actions . . . were taken with the knowledge of or acquiescence by\u201d the other defendants.\n\n\n. Section 230 defines an \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d as \u201cany information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [f] [2]).\n\n",

It is unfortunate that in this, our first case interpreting the Communications Decency Act (CDA) (47 USC \u00a7 230), we have shielded defendants from the allegation that they abused their power as Web site publishers to promote and amplify defamation targeted at a business competitor. Even in the muted form in which the majority presents them, the allegations concerning the Web site operator\u2019s material contributions to the scurrilous defamatory attacks against Mr. Shiamili and Ardor Realty are sufficiently stated and are outside the scope of CDA immunity.\nPlaintiff alleged that defendants published defamatory content, which claimed, in vulgar terms, that plaintiff was a racist and anti-Semite who mistreated his employees, could not retain real estate agents, failed to pay office bills, beat up his wife, and used his office space to commit adultery with prostitutes.* The allegedly defamatory statements included the following: \u201cI have personally heard [plaintiff] making derogatory comments about [various ethnic groups]. He calls them \u2018those people,\u2019 etc. He has even said he keeps [his main listing agent] around only because he is Jewish, and this is how he gets \u2018those\u2019 landlords . . . [Plaintiff] has called him his token Jew.\u201d\nIf the complaint alleged that defendants merely reposted these outrageous statements to a more prominent position on the *294Web site, this could plausibly be considered an exercise of \u201ca publisher\u2019s traditional editorial functions\u201d (Zeran v America Online, Inc., 129 F3d 327, 330 [4th Cir 1997], cert denied 524 US 937 [1998]). But, the allegations of defendants\u2019 actions here are not so benign.\nAccording to the complaint, defendants not only moved the defamatory comments to an independent post entitled \u201cArdor Realty and Those People,\u201d but embellished the comment thread by attaching a large, doctored photograph of plaintiff depicted as Jesus Christ, with the heading: \u201cChris Shiamili: King of the Token Jews.\u201d The defamatory statements were \u201cpreceded by an editor\u2019s note, on information and belief written and published by [defendant] McCann, that \u2018the following story came to us as a long . . . comment, and we promoted it to a post.\u2019 \u201d McCann also allegedly introduced the post with the statements: \u201c \u2018[A]nd now it\u2019s time for your weekly dose of hate\u2019 and \u2018for the record, we are so. not. afraid.\u2019 \u201d\nThe majority is anxious to trivialize the religiously charged illustration as \u201cobviously satirical\u201d and \u201cnot a defamatory statement, since no \u2018reasonable reader could have concluded ... [it was] conveying facts about the plaintiff \u201d (majority op at 292 [citation omitted]). Of course, a reasonable reader would not have gathered from this digitally edited photograph that defendants were asserting that plaintiff was in fact Jesus Christ or the king of \u201ctoken\u201d Jewish real estate agents. But a reasonable reader, viewing the heading and illustration, might very well have concluded that the site editor was endorsing the truth of the appended facts, which asserted that plaintiff was an anti-Semite who employed a single Jewish realtor in order to maintain business with Jewish landlords. Even setting aside the preface referring to the \u201cweekly dose of hate\u201d and the allegations of defendants\u2019 efforts to instigate additional attacks against plaintiff\u2019s character and business, defendants\u2019 attachment of this illustration, if proven, should alone defeat their immunity under the CDA. As the majority concedes, it is well established in federal law that \u201ca website helps to develop unlawful content, and thus falls within the exception to section 230, if it contributes materially to the alleged illegality of the conduct\u201d (Fair Hous. Council of San Fernando Val. v Roomates.Com, LLC (521 F3d 1157, 1168 [9th Cir 2008]; see also Federal Trade Commn. v Accusearch Inc., 570 F3d 1187, 1199 [10th Cir 2009] [\u201c(A) service provider is \u2018responsible\u2019 for the *295development of offensive content only if it in some way specifically encourages development of what is offensive about the content\u201d]).\nLike the majority, I accept the \u201cnational consensus\u201d on statutory immunity under the CDA (majority op at 288). However, I see no basis in the record for the majority\u2019s confident conclusion that defendants served only as a passive conduit of this defamatory material, and are therefore immune as a matter of law. As the majority notes, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, titled \u201cProtection for private blocking and screening of offensive material,\u201d was prompted by the undesirable result in Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v Prodigy Servs. Co. (1995 WL 323710, 1995 NY Misc LEXIS 229 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1995]), where the trial court held a service provider liable in a defamation action based on its voluntary efforts to filter and edit offensive messages posted on its bulletin boards. This editorial activity, the court reasoned, rendered the provider a publisher and thus responsible for libelous content posted on its Web site (see 1995 WL 323710 at *4, 1995 NY Misc LEXIS 229 at *10-11).\nConcerned that cases like Stratton Oakmont, Inc. would discourage providers from censoring offensive content on their own sites, Congress enacted section 230, in part, to insulate providers from liability for \u201cany action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 230 [c] [2] [A]). Both houses of Congress stressed that \u201c[o]ne of the specific purposes of this section is to overrule Stratton-Oakmont v. Prodigy and any other similar decisions which have treated such providers and users as publishers or speakers of content that is not their own because they have restricted access to objectionable material\u201d (HR Rep 104-458, 104th Cong, 2d Sess, at 194; S Rep 104-230, 104th Cong, 2d Sess, at 194 [containing same quote]).\nWhile I do not dispute the adoption of a broad approach to immunity for on-line service providers under the CDA, an interpretation that immunizes a business\u2019s complicity in defaming a direct competitor takes us so far afield from the purpose of the CDA as to make it unrecognizable. Dismissing this action on the pleadings is not required by the letter of the law and does not honor its spirit.\n*296Judges Graffeo, Read and Smith concur with Judge Ciparick; Chief Judge Lippman dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judges Pigott and Jones concur.\nOrder affirmed, with costs.\n\n We must deem the allegations of the complaint to be true in considering defendants\u2019 CPLR 3211 (a) (7) motion to dismiss.\n\n",
