The trial court sentenced Frazier to an advisory term of six\n\n      years of incarceration, with two suspended to probation. Frazier contends that\n\n      his sentence is inappropriately harsh. Because we disagree, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                            Facts and Procedural History\n[2]   On January 9, 2016, Frazier sold 1.3 grams of methamphetamine to a\n\n      confidential informant for $130.00 in Rush County. On April 28, 2016, the\n\n      State charged Frazier with Level 4 felony dealing in methamphetamine, Level 6\n\n      felony methamphetamine possession, and Level 6 felony dealing in a controlled\n\n      substance. On September 11, 2017, Frazier pled guilty to Level 4 felony dealing\n\n      in methamphetamine, and the trial court sentenced him to six years of\n\n      incarceration, with two suspended to probation.\n\n\n                                 Discussion and Decision\n[3]   Frazier contends that his sentence is inappropriately harsh. We \u201cmay revise a\n\n      sentence authorized by statute if, after due consideration of the trial court\u2019s\n\n      decision, the Court finds that the sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature\n\n      of the offense and the character of the offender.\u201d Ind. Appellate Rule 7(B).\n\n      \u201cAlthough appellate review of sentences must give due consideration to the trial\n\n      court\u2019s sentence because of the special expertise of the trial bench in making\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 70A04-1710-CR-2380 | January 24, 2018   Page 2 of 4\n\f      sentencing decisions, Appellate Rule 7(B) is an authorization to revise sentences\n\n      when certain broad conditions are satisfied.\u201d Shouse v. State, 849 N.E.2d 650,\n\n      660 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006), trans. denied (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n      \u201c[W]hether we regard a sentence as appropriate at the end of the day turns on\n\n      our sense of the culpability of the defendant, the severity of the crime, the\n\n      damage done to others, and myriad other factors that come to light in a given\n\n      case.\u201d Cardwell v. State, 895 N.E.2d 1219, 1224 (Ind. 2008). In addition to the\n\n      \u201cdue consideration\u201d we are required to give to the trial court\u2019s sentencing\n\n      decision, \u201cwe understand and recognize the unique perspective a trial court\n\n      brings to its sentencing decisions.\u201d Rutherford v. State, 866 N.E.2d 867, 873\n\n      (Ind. Ct. App. 2007). The trial court sentenced Frazier to six years of\n\n      incarceration for Level 4 felony dealing in methamphetamine, with two\n\n      suspended to probation. Six years is the advisory sentence for a Level 4 felony.\n\n      See Ind. Code \u00a7 35-50-2-5.5.\n\n\n[4]   The nature of the offense is that Frazier sold 1.3 grams of methamphetamine to\n\n      a confidential informant. While this offense does not seem to be particularly\n\n      heinous in terms of drug deals, Frazier\u2019s six-year, advisory sentence already\n\n      reflects that, even before one considers the two years suspended to probation.\n\n      While the nature of Frazier\u2019s offense might not support the imposition of an\n\n      enhanced sentence, it does not follow that it must support a reduced sentence.\n\n\n[5]   As for Frazier\u2019s character, his lengthy criminal history does not speak well of\n\n      him. Frazier, who was thirty-two years old at the time of sentencing, has had\n\n      eight prior misdemeanor convictions, including public intoxication, two\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 70A04-1710-CR-2380 | January 24, 2018   Page 3 of 4\n\f      convictions for possession of marijuana, possession of paraphernalia, and\n\n      possession of methamphetamine. Frazier also has five prior felony convictions,\n\n      including theft, maintaining a common nuisance, and neglect of a dependent.\n\n      The offense to which Frazier pled guilty is similar to most of the offenses for\n\n      which he has already been convicted, albeit more serious: Frazier has\n\n      progressed from mere possession of illegal drugs to dealing them. Despite\n\n      Frazier\u2019s many criminal convictions, he has not chosen to reform himself, and\n\n      in fact, the severity of his crimes seems to be increasing. Frazier has failed to\n\n      establish that his six-year, advisory sentence (with two years suspended to\n\n      probation) is inappropriate in light of the nature of his offense and his character.\n\n\n[6]   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n      Robb, J., and Crone, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 70A04-1710-CR-2380 | January 24, 2018   Page 4 of 4\n\f",
