The Wongs made a claim\nfor property damage, which Stillwater denied. The Wongs sued, and\nStillwater moved for summary judgment, on two bases: the Wongs could not\nsubmit evidence of (1) \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d or (2) that \u201cone of the sixteen\nspecified perils occurred.\u201d The trial court granted summary judgment. We\naffirm.\n\n\n                                        1\n\f                                BACKGROUND\n      The General Setting1\n      Beginning in 2014, the Wongs pursued in vitro fertilization, working\nwith Aimee Eyvazzadeh, M.D., as their doctor. In 2015, the Wongs completed\nan in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, and obtained four viable embryos, one of\nwhich was implanted. As to the other three, as Dr. Eyvazzadeh put it, after\ndiscussion with the Wongs they determined to \u201cbank the rest,\u201d which they did\nat Pacific Fertility Center (Pacific Fertility or PFC), a facility in San\nFrancisco that included several cryogenic storage tanks that used liquid\nnitrogen to store human embryos at very low temperatures. Specifically, the\nembryos were stored in Tank 4, which also contained embryos belonging to\nother people.\n      On or about March 4, 2018, Tank 4 failed to maintain the temperature\nnecessary to store embryos, as a result at least some (and possibly all) of the\nembryos stored in that tank partially or totally thawed.\n      On March 11, Pacific Fertility sent its patients, including the Wongs,\nan email stating that \u201c[e]arlier this week, a single piece of equipment lost\nliquid nitrogen for a brief period of time,\u201d and that Pacific Fertility was\n\u201ccontinuing to gather information.\u201d\n      The next month, on or about April 19, Pacific Fertility sent its patients,\nincluding the Wongs, a letter stating that \u201c[p]reliminary findings\u201d indicated\nthat the temperature of Tank 4 had risen due to \u201ca failure of the tank\u2019s\nvacuum seal\u201d and that \u201cinvestigations into all aspects of this incident\ncontinue.\u201d\n\n\n\n      1 Many of the pertinent background facts were agreed to in a joint\nstipulation below, which stipulation is the basis of some of the background\nhere.\n                                         2\n\f      The Wongs had a homeowners insurance policy with Stillwater that\nunder \u201cCoverage C\u201d provided coverage for personal property the Wongs\n\u201cowned or used\u201d while \u201canywhere in the world,\u201d with policy limits for\npersonal property of $502,720. The policy was a \u201cspecified perils\u201d policy, the\nsignificance of which is that in order to demonstrate a covered loss the\ninsured has \u201cthe threshold burden of proving the loss was caused by a\nspecifically-enumerated peril.\u201d (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide:\nInsurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2022) \u00b6 6:253.2 (Croskey).)\nSpecifically, the policy provided that \u201cWe insure for direct physical loss to the\nproperty described in Coverage C caused by any of the following perils,\u201d going\non to list 16.2\n      On May 2, on behalf of the Wongs, attorney David Rosenberg-Wohl sent\na letter to Stillwater making a claim under the policy, a letter that read in its\nentirety as follows:\n      \u201cI represent Lawrence and Sherlene Wong, who had three zygotes\nfrozen in a tank at Pacific Fertility Center, which they entrusted to serve\nthem as IVF patients for family planning. The Wongs have been advised by\ntheir fertility physician, Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, that they should consider\nthese zygotes to have been irretrievably compromised by the recent tank\n\n\n      2 The 16 perils were identified as follows: \u201c\u00b61. Fire Or Lightening;\n\u00b62. Windstorm Or Hail . . .; \u00b63. Explosion; \u00b64. Riot Or Civil Commotion;\n\u00b65. Aircraft . . .; \u00b66. Vehicles; \u00b67. Smoke . . .; \u00b68.

Sudden And Accidental Damage From Artificially\nGenerated Electrical Current . . .; \u00b616. Volcanic Eruption.\u201d\n                                        3\n\fdisaster at Pacific Fertility Center on or about March 4, 2018, and that their\nzygotes are no longer viable, and lost.\n      \u201cUnder my clients\u2019 homeowners policy (#NP6063026), my clients are\ncovered under \u2018Coverage C\u2019 for loss of personal property up to $516,790.\nBecause my clients have lost three zygotes, each of which has a financial\nvalue well in excess of the personal property limits, the Wongs have a\npotential claim against Stillwater . . . for $516,790 x 3, or $1,550,370. If each\nhas a separate claim, the amounts double.\n      \u201cWe are presently preparing litigation against Pacific Fertility Center,\nits parent/owner/investor, Prelude Fertility, Inc. the manufacturer of the\nnitrogen tank (which we believe to be Chart Inc./Chart BioMedical), and any\nothers who share responsibility. I am writing you because the homeowners\npolicy requires prompt notice following a covered loss.\u201d\n      As is apparent, Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl\u2019s letter did not refer to any of the\n16 perils.\n      Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl later submitted various documents to Stillwater,\none of which was a printout of the March 11 email from Pacific Fertility that\nstated among other things that tissue \u201cmay have been impacted\u201d but that \u201cwe\ndo expect that some of the tissue from the tank remains viable.\u201d Another was\na letter postmarked April 20, in which Pacific Fertility stated that\n\u201c[p]reliminary findings\u201d indicated it was \u201clikely\u201d there had been \u201ca failure of\nthe tank\u2019s vacuum seal,\u201d that \u201cinvestigations into all aspects of this incident\ncontinue,\u201d and that Pacific Fertility had confirmed \u201cthere is viable tissue from\nthe tank.\u201d\n      The Wongs\u2019s claim was assigned to Matt Maloley, senior claims\nexaminer at Stillwater. Stillwater retained attorney Michelle Burton to\nevaluate the Wongs\u2019s claim, providing her a copy of the policy, the email\n\n\n                                          4\n\fdated March 11, the letter postmarked April 20, and Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl\u2019s\nletter.\n      On August 3, Ms. Burton sent Stillwater a letter that outlined her\ncoverage evaluation, which among other things concluded that she \u201ccannot\nascertain from the file whether the insured\u2019s zygotes were compromised,\nwhether they are still viable or whether there has been a determination\neither way.\u201d And, she further concluded, there was no evidence the claimed\ndamage resulted from any of the 16 perils that apply to personal property as\nset forth in the policy.\n      On August 6, Maloley sent Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl a letter denying the\nWongs\u2019s claim, which letter stated in pertinent part as follows:\n      \u201cWe received and reviewed the documents sent via email dated July 6,\n2018 and related to the insureds\u2019 loss of zygotes due to a mechanical failure\nof the storage tank\u2019s vacuum seal.\n      \u201cMy review of the policy finds that coverage is only provided for loss to\npersonal property which is the result of one of the named perils for which the\npolicy extends coverage. Because the loss was not the result of one of the\nnamed perils for which the policy extends coverage, we regret to inform you\nthat we will be unable to compensate for the costs associated with this loss.\n      \u201cThese limitations and exclusions in coverage are located in your policy\nand policy endorsements as cited below.\n      \u201cENDORSEMENT A6140 07 15\n      \u201cUnder SECTION I \u2013 PERILS INSURED AGAINST, B.

The complaint alleged five causes\nof action labeled (1) breach of contract, (2) negligence, (3) declaratory\njudgment, (4) injunctive relief/specific performance, and (5) unjust\nenrichment. However, within the breach of contract claim was reference to\nbreach \u201cof the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\u201d and within the\nnegligence claim was that defendants \u201cfailed to comply with is duties as a\nfiduciary of Plaintiffs.\u201d3 So, however inartfully, the complaint alleged, or at\nleast referred to, seven causes of action.\n      On January 15, 2020, Stillwater filed a motion for summary judgment\nor, alternatively, summary adjudication. The fundamental argument was\nthat the Wongs \u201ccannot establish essential elements\u201d of the breach of contract\n\n      3 The complaint did not distinguish between the two defendants as to\nany of the causes of action, but as to GEICO alleged that it had issued an\numbrella policy. No third party claim was made against the Wongs, and in\nJune 2019, they dismissed the case as against GEICO.\n\n                                         7\n\fclaim because \u201cthe policy covers personal property only for \u2018direct physical\nloss\u2019 caused by one . . . of the [16] specified perils.\u201d And it continued, the\n\u201cWongs bear the burden of proving that the alleged loss falls within the\nInsuring Agreement,\u201d which they failed to do in two particulars, as they did\nnot submit evidence of (1) \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d or (2) that \u201cone of the sixteen\nspecified perils occurred.\u201d\n      On this latter point\u2014no proof of any specified peril\u2014their argument\nreferred to the written communications from Pacific Fertility, which\nargument Stillwater summed up as follows: \u201cIn short, the Wongs never\nprovided Stillwater with actual evidence of why Tank 4 failed to maintain\nproper temperature. Instead, the Wongs merely conveyed to Stillwater what\nPacific Fertility characterized as \u2018preliminary findings,\u2019 i.e., that a \u2018vacuum\nseal\u2019 on Tank 4 had failed. [\u00b6] Importantly, Stillwater itself does not contend\nthat a \u2018vacuum seal\u2019 on Tank 4 had failed. In other words, Stillwater is not\noffering Pacific Fertility\u2019s statements to prove the truth of those statements.\nInstead, Stillwater is only offering Pacific Fertility\u2019s statements to show what\ninformation the Wongs provided to Stillwater\u2014and to show that the Wongs\nnever submitted any evidence that one of the policy\u2019s sixteen specified perils\nhad actually occurred. Further, as will be explained, even if the Wongs were\nto now actually prove that a \u2018vacuum seal\u2019 on Tank 4 failed, such an event\nstill would not constitute one of the sixteen perils specified in the policy.\u201d\n      Apparently looking at which of the 16 specified perils could possibly be\npertinent, the motion went on to demonstrate that the loss was not caused by\n\u201cPeril 12,\u201d which covers damage caused by the \u201cdischarge or overflow of water\nor steam from within a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic fire\nprotective sprinkler system from within a household appliance.\u201d The motion\npointed out that liquid nitrogen is not \u201cwater\u201d or \u201csteam,\u201d and a cryogenic\n\n\n                                         8\n\fstorage tank that uses liquid nitrogen to store human embryos at an\nextremely cold temperature \u201ccannot reasonably be characterized as a\n\u2018plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler\nsystem or . . . a household appliance.\u2019 \u201d\n      Similarly, the motion demonstrated that the loss was not caused by\n\u201cPeril 13,\u201d which \u201ccovers damage caused by the \u2018sudden and accidental\ntearing apart, cracking, burning or bulging of a steam or hot water heating\nsystem, and air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler system or\nan appliance for heating water.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the motion summed up, \u201cthe Wongs\u2019s\nhave no evidence that one of the sixteen specified perils occurred.\u201d4\n      The Wongs filed their opposition to the motion that, to the extent it\naddressed the issues pertinent here, was brief indeed, less than three pages.\nThe opposition was accompanied by declarations of both of the Wongs, their\nattorney, Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl, and their fertility doctor, Dr. Eyvazzadeh. As\nthe stipulation would later provide, the Wongs had no personal \u201cknowledge of\nthe precise reason Tank 4 failed to maintain the temperature necessary to\nstore embryos.\u201d Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl\u2019s short declaration essentially sought to\nauthenticate five exhibits. And Dr. Eyvazzadeh\u2019s declaration testified to her\ntraining, background, professional experience, including with Pacific\nFertility, and mostly to her years-long relationship with the Wongs. As\npossibly relevant to the issues here, Dr. Eyvazzadeh\u2019s declaration had these\ntwo paragraphs:\n      \u201c8. As a result of this disaster, the Wongs\u2019 embryos became worthless.\nNo responsible fertility physician would use them; I certainly would not.\n\n\n\n      4The motion went on to argue that the other causes of action failed\nbecause they were dependent on the breach of contract claim.\n\n                                        9\n\f      \u201c9. The science behind IVF is precise, including what we know about\nvitrification. We don\u2019t know the consequences of embryos that could have\npartially thawed. We don\u2019t \u2018wing it\u2019 or guess that something is \u2018close enough.\u2019\nThere was\u2014and is\u2014no way to know about the resulting consequences to cells\nthemselves. While it would be possible to look at thawed zygotes and observe\nthe outer structure of cells to observe apparent integrity, even if the cell walls\nwere to appear sound, there is no way to know whether the cells, once\nimplanted, begin to divide. Nor is there a way to test sufficiently for any\nresulting damage to genes within any of these cells. I advised the Wongs that\nthey should consider these embryos to have been irreversibly compromised,\nno longer viable, and lost.\u201d\n      The Wongs\u2019s opposition memorandum of points and authorities was a\ntotal of 19 pages, with a table of contents that lists three items:\n(1) \u201cIntroduction\u201d; (2) \u201cThe Wongs have coverage for their property loss\u201d; and\n(3) \u201cStillwater\u2019s investigation and denial of the Wongs\u2019[s] claim was\nunreasonable and improper. . . .\u201d The introduction acknowledged among\nother things that the Wongs \u201caccept virtually all of the legal arguments\nadvanced by Stillwater,\u201d including specifically that they \u201crecognize that they\nhave the burden of proving that their loss was caused by a covered peril,\u201d\ngoing on to assert that \u201cthey provide evidence below that they lost their\nembryos due to an explosion, a covered peril, at PFC\u201d\u2014the first time the\nWongs referred to \u201cexplosion.\u201d The introduction also acknowledged that the\nWongs \u201crecognize that they need to make a showing of actual loss, but any\n\u2018physical alteration\u2019 suffices, even if not visible to the naked eye. See MRI\nHealthcare Center of Glendale, Inc. v. State Farm General Ins. Co.,\n187 Cal.App.4th 766, 778\u2212[7]89 (2010) [(MRI)].\u201d And finally the introduction\nended with this: \u201cThe Wongs accept that without coverage, their tort claim\n\n\n                                        10\n\ffor violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing falls (COA 1), as\ndoes their claim for negligence (and their claim for breach of fiduciary duty)\n(COA 2). The Wongs also accept that their claims for declaratory relief (COA\n3) and for specific performance (COA 4) are contract-dependent. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter, because their claim for breach of contract is solid.\u201d\n      As to their arguments on the merits, the Wongs argued that \u201cthe\nembryos were lost in the [Pacific Fertility] explosion, which prematurely\nthawed and damaged the cells in the tank.\u201d Then, after a brief two-\nparagraph argument on this, the opposition concluded with these two brief\narguments:\n      \u201cC. Regardless, Stillwater has waived any challenge to the question of\nproperty loss.\n      \u201cStillwater, despite concluding that it could deny coverage on the\ngrounds that the embryos were not covered property, decided to forego that\nbasis for denial and use instead only that the peril was not covered.\n[Citation.] This was an intentional choice, made internally and expressed in\nthe denial letter. [Citation.] A jury could easily see this as grasping at an\napparently easy basis for denial and avoiding the risk of insulting\npolicyholders with a possibly offensive claim that this was not in fact\nproperty at all. Regardless, the Wongs took the basis for Stillwater\u2019s decision\nat face value. [Citations.] All that Stillwater reserved was if it happened\nupon a new basis for denial\u2014but it had already fully considered and chose\nnot to deny on the basis of personal property loss. [Citation.]\u201d\n      Then, after citing to some state regulations, the opposition argued that\n\u201cStillwater should be precluded from arguing in this case that coverage is\nsomehow precluded on the basis of personal property loss. [Citation.] Here,\nthe record is unequivocal.\u201d\n\n\n                                       11\n\f      \u201cD. And the loss of the embryos was precisely what Stillwater\nprematurely determined it was not: the result of a covered peril, namely an\nexplosion.\n      \u201cPeril is not defined. [Citation.] But an explosion is a covered peril.\n[Citation.]\n      \u201cAt the time Stillwater denied the claim, it had no information as to the\ncause of the disaster. All that Stillwater had was what PFC had provided to\nthe Wongs, which the Wongs\u2019[s] counsel had provided to Stillwater: there\nwas preliminary information from PFC that what had failed was the tank\nseal. [Citation.] But there was no information as to how that had happened\nand therefore the cause, or peril. [Citation.]\n      \u201cCoverage counsel guessed that the cause was \u2018freezing\u2019 so she could\nrecommend denial. [Citation.] She explicitly stated the cause was not an\nexplosion. [Citation.] Stillwater denied the claim on this basis. [Citation.]\nActually Stillwater improved upon her guess, declaring that the cause was\n\u2018mechanical failure.\u2019 [Citation.]\n      \u201cAn explosion was, in fact, determined to be the cause of the disaster.\nSSUF 140.\u201d\n      The Wongs\u2019s opposition did not support the basis of their position that\nthe loss was caused by an \u201cexplosion,\u201d other than referring to \u201cSSUF 140.\u201d\nThe claimed support for the contention was in exhibit O to Mr. Rosenberg-\nWohl\u2019s declaration, which was a copy of some selected pages of a 185-page\ndeposition taken of Dr. Anand Kasbekar in a case in the United States\nDistrict Court in Colorado\u2014a deposition, not incidentally, that was not\nsigned.\n      According to the excerpt from the deposition, Dr. Kasbekar and the\nquestioning attorney had this exchange at pages 20 to 22 of the deposition:\n\n\n                                       12\n\f        \u201cQ. Once you were retained in this case, what did you do to familiarize\nyourself with cryogenic tanks, generally?\n        \u201cA. I think early on, I was looking for examples of implosions.\nHonestly, I\u2019ve seen tank explosions in some of the cases I\u2019ve been involved in,\nbut I haven\u2019t seen an implosion similar to the one that we had here. So I was\nlooking for information about that. I had a theory as to how I thought it\nhappened, but I hadn\u2019t looked at the tank closely at that point. I think that\nwas the main thing I was looking at.\n        \u201cQ. Is it your view\u2014not your view. Is the word that you used to\ndescribe what happened to Tank 4 an implosion or an explosion?\n        \u201cA. So my opinion really is I would call it an explosion of the vacuum\nspace, but I think it\u2019s fair to also call it an implosion of the inner wall of the\ntank. It\u2019s\u2014normally when I think of an implosion, I think of\u2014and in\ncryogenic tanks and failure analysis, its normally when you\u2019ve sucked a\nvacuum on the internal tank space, and where you often see it in tankers\nand\u2014where there\u2019s been an issue, and it\u2019s pretty dramatic when you have the\nloss of pressure inside the tank and atmospheric pressure bearing down on\nthe outside of the tank.\n        \u201cQ. I totally agree because the words are funky.\n        \u201cA. But your client uses, to the best of my knowledge, the word\n\u2018implosion,\u2019 which I think\u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s technically incorrect or not. It\u2019s\nkind of tomato, tomato.\n        \u201cQ. I think the reference might be implosion towards the midline of the\ntank. I think that might be it, but just so we\u2019re clear, when we say \u2018implosion\u2019\nor \u2018explosion\u2019 we\u2019re referring to pressure being exerted against both the inside\nand the outside of the walls with the thinner tank walls buckling. Is that\nfair?\n\n\n                                         13\n\f        \u201cA. Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d phrase it that way. If you\u2019re going to argue\nit\u2019s an implosion, you have a lower pressure on the interior of the tank than\nyou do on the exterior of the interior tank wall. Does that make sense?\n        \u201cQ. That makes sense.\n        \u201cA. So that would\u2014the lack of pressure on the inside or the imbalance,\nyou could argue, would be an implosion. I really look at it more as if the\nvacuum space becomes a balloon and nitrogen gas expands within that\nvacuum space or balloon, you\u2019re exploding that vacuum space. The outside\nwall is more robust than the inside wall, so the damage occurs to the inside\nwall.\n        \u201cQ. All right. Let\u2019s use the word \u2018explosion.\u2019\n        \u201cA. Fair enough.\u201d\n        On December 14, Stillwater filed its reply to the Wongs\u2019s opposition,\nincluded within which was an objection to the Dr. Kasbekar material as\nhearsay and lack of foundation.\n        As to the no \u201cphysical loss\u201d issue, Stillwater\u2019s reply argued that Dr.\nEyvazzadeh\u2019s declaration established what Stillwater had contended from the\noutset, that the Wongs could not meet their burden of proving a \u201cphysical\nloss\u201d because Dr. Eyvazzadeh herself admitted there is \u201cno way to know\u201d\nwhether the Wongs\u2019s embryos had undergone an actual physical change.\n        As to the \u201cspecified peril\u201d issue, Stillwater\u2019s reply argued that Dr.\nKasbekar\u2019s deposition testimony in the federal case was hearsay and for\nseveral reasons was not admissible. Among other things, Stillwater argued\nthat because it was not a party to the federal court case and not present at\nDr. Kasbekar\u2019s deposition, Stillwater had no opportunity to cross-examine\nhim. Finally, Stillwater argued that even if the court were to consider\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fDr. Kasbekar\u2019s deposition testimony, it did not demonstrate an \u201cexplosion\u201d as\nthat term is understood by ordinary persons.\n      Stillwater\u2019s motion came on for hearing on January 26, 2021, prior to\nwhich the trial court had issued a tentative ruling that, as the court itself\nwould later describe it in an attachment to the order granting summary\njudgment, put the motion in the following posture for argument:\n      \u201cOn January 25, 2021, the Court issued a tentative ruling which found\nquestions of fact on whether the Plaintiffs suffered property damage and\nwhether Defendant waived the issue. For the Court, a key issue was whether\ndeposition testimony provided by an expert, Anand Kasbekar, PhD, in\nanother case, who opined that the loss was caused by an explosion, was\nadmissible. If the transcript was admissible, the testimony would create an\nissue of fact on whether the cause of the incident was a covered peril under\nthe policy. The transcript was attached as Exhibit O to the Declaration of\nDavid M. Rosenberg-Wohl, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\n      \u201cDefendant objected to the expert testimony in its entirely [sic] on the\nbasis of hearsay and no foundation. [Citation.] This deposition was taken on\nDecember 13, 2019 in In re Pacific Fertility Center Litigation, Case No. 3:18-\ncv-01586-JSC pending in the United States District Court, District of\nColorado. The deposition was taken in Denver Colorado and the oath is not\nset forth in the transcript. [Citation.] Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl was not present\nat the deposition. [Citation.] Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl\u2019s declaration states that\nhe down-loaded it from a document depository maintained by plaintiffs\u2019\ncounsel in a federal action and which is the subject of a request for judicial\nnotice. Rosenberg-Wohl\u2019s Declaration, paragraph 2 attached to the Notice of\nMotion and Motion for Order Sealing Portion of Record filed October 7, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fThe Request for Judicial Notice only referred to Evidence Code sections 452\nand 453 generally.\n      \u201cSince Defendant had not provided any analysis of the objection to Dr.\nKasbekar\u2019s deposition and Plaintiffs had not responded to the objections, the\nCourt\u2019s tentative requested argument on this issue. The tentative stated:\n      \u201cThe Court withholds issuing a tentative on the objections to the\ntestimony of Anand Kasbekar, PhD. If the Court considers the testimony of\nDr. Kasbekar, then the Court finds that there are issues of fact on whether\nthere was an explosion, a covered peril. While Stillwater argues that his\nopinion should not be considered because it is an expert opinion, contrary to\nthe lay definition of explosion, the Court cannot find as a matter of law in\nruling on a summary judgment motion, that the opinion is unreasonable.\nThus, if the testimony is considered, it raises questions of fact precluding\nsummary judgment/adjudication. The parties, however, are to present\nargument on whether the testimony is admissible. The Court directs the\nparties\u2019 attention to Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co.\n(2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 948\u2212949 [(Sweetwater)]; Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne,\nLLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 543 [(Perry)]; Williams v. Saga Enterprises, Inc.\n(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 142, 149 [(Williams)]; and any other case law that they\nbelieve appropriate. If the parties are going to rely on any other authority,\nthey are to email . . . .\u201d\n      Against that background, the hearing occurred. And at one point in the\nhearing, addressing Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl, the court stated that if\nDr. Kasbekar \u201chad not been disclosed, then his testimony would not be\nadmissible at trial and . . . therefore under the Perry decision could not be\nintroduced on summary judgment.\u201d Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl did not\nmeaningfully respond, and then asked for the opportunity to provide a \u201ccase\n\n\n                                       16\n\fcitation . . . today.\u201d The court took a recess, following which Mr. Rosenberg-\nWohl cited to two cases, the first of which was ordered not published. The\nsecond was Egan v. Mut. Of Omaha Ins. Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 809, 817, which\nhe claimed supported his position that to recover on his bad faith claim he\nhad \u201cno burden to show that there is coverage under the policy.\u201d\n        Following some further colloquy, the court concluded as follows:\n        \u201cTHE COURT: Wait. Let me just stop you. I am sorry, but I disagree.\nSo what I am going to do is I am going to sustain the objections to the . . .\ndeposition testimony of Kas[b]ekar. I am going to keep my\u2014in case it goes\nup, I guess if it goes up on appeal, it\u2019s all de novo, but I find that since the\ndeposition testimony would not be admissible at trial, because the expert was\nnot disclosed, that the summary judgment is granted, because of a failure of\nthe plaintiff to raise any issue showing that it was a covered peril.\n        \u201cSo I will be granting the summary judgment. . . . The minutes should\nsay that summary judgment is granted and that it\u2019s modified as to the\nportion of it as\u2014as to the deposition testimony from Dr. Kas[b]ekar, . . . and\nthat if the summary judgment is granted on the first cause of action, the rest\nof it, cause of action, also fails.\u201d\n        On February 9, the trial court filed its order granting the motion for\nsummary judgment, which order provided in pertinent part as follows:\n        \u201cAfter hearing argument of counsel, the Court ruled as follows:\n        \u201cThe Court granted the request for judicial notice (submitted by\nStillwater) and the request for judicial notice (submitted by the Wongs).\n        \u201cThe Court overruled Stillwater\u2019s Objections 1, 2, and 3, but sustained\nStillwater\u2019s Objection 4, to the declaration of Aimee Eyvazzadeh, M.D.\n[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\f      \u201cSustained Stillwater\u2019s Objection 1 to the deposition testimony of\nAnand David Kasbekar, Ph.D. (Exhibit O, submitted by the Wongs).\n      \u201cBecause the Wongs did not designate Anand David Kasbekar, Ph.D. as\nan expert, his deposition testimony taken in another case would be\ninadmissible at trial of this case and, therefore, his deposition testimony\ncannot be used to create a triable issue of fact about whether an \u2018explosion\u2019\noccurred.\n      \u201cIn the absence of admissible evidence of an \u2018explosion\u2019 (or some other\nperil specified in the Stillwater insurance policy), the Wongs cannot establish\ntheir cause of action for breach of contract.\n      \u201cBecause the Wongs cannot establish their cause of action for breach of\ncontract, all other causes of action (whether characterized as breach of the\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, declaratory relief,\ninjunctive relief, specific performance, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary\nduty or otherwise) fail as a matter of law.\n      \u201cStillwater has met its burden of demonstrating that the causes of\naction alleged in the Wongs\u2019[s] complaint cannot be established, and the\nWongs have not raised a triable issue of material fact as to any of those\ncauses of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c[,\nsubdivision] (p)(2).\n      \u201cTherefore, the Wongs\u2019[s] complaint is subject to summary judgment.\n      \u201cIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Stillwater\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment is GRANTED, and that judgment in favor of Stillwater\nand against the Wongs shall be entered accordingly.\u201d\n      The order then added, in the handwriting of the court, this: \u201cSee\nattachment incorporated by reference hereto . . . .\u201d The attachment included\nthe passage quoted above as to the tentative ruling, and then included this\n\n\n                                       18\n\fentry made after the argument: \u201cAfter hearing the argument and Plaintiffs\u2019\nconcession that the parties had disclosed experts but that Plaintiffs had not\ndisclosed Dr. Kasbekar, the Court sustained the objection to the admission of\nDr. Kasbekar\u2019s deposition. Although a deposition from another case may be\nadmissible, Sweetwater, [supra,] 6 Cal.5th at [pp.] 948\u2212949; Williams,\n[supra,] 225 Cal.App.3d at [p.] 149, the testimony must be admissible at trial.\n[Sweetwater,] at [p.] 948; Perry, [supra,] 2 Cal.5th at [p.] 543; Weil & Brown,\nCal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial \u00a7 10:205 (TRG 2020). In this case, the\ntestimony could not be admissible because of Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to identify\nDr. Kasbekar as an expert. Perry at [p.] 543. The deposition transcript was\nthus hearsay. While Plaintiff argued that Dr. Kasbekar was not an expert\nand did not need to be disclosed, the Court disagrees. His testimony in the\nfederal case was as a retained expert and he did not have personal knowledge\nof what occurred. [Citation.] Since Plaintiffs did not introduce any evidence\nwhich would be admissible at trial to counter Defendant\u2019s evidence that the\nincident occurred because of a failure of the tank\u2019s vacuum seal, Undisputed\nFac[t] No. 4-7, summary judgment was appropriate.\u201d\n      The Wongs filed a motion for reconsideration based on Mr. Rosenberg-\nWohl\u2019s declaration that he \u201ccame across\u201d the transcript of Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s\ndeposition in a database pertaining to the many cases arising from the failure\nof Tank 4; that he had \u201cno relationship\u201d with Dr. Kasbekar and had never\neven spoken to him; and that he had offered to hire Dr. Kasbekar, but the\nlawyer who had hired him as an expert in the Colorado case specifically\nrefused to allow him to consult with, or otherwise work for, Mr. Rosenberg-\nWohl. Nonetheless, Mr. Rosenberg-Wohl maintained that his use of excerpts\nof Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s deposition to oppose Stillwater\u2019s motion was tantamount to\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\fa designation of experts that complied with Code of Civil Procedure section\n2034.260 et seq.\n      The trial court denied reconsideration, and confirmed the order\ngranting summary judgment. The court noted that the Wongs \u201cmade no\neffort, after the Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, to retain Dr. Kasbekar\nor some other expert with the same opinion, and then file a motion to\nsupplement their expert witnesses.\u201d And, the court held, \u201cAccordingly,\nsummary judgment is still proper because Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s testimony is not\nadmissible at trial. Plaintiffs have no evidence to demonstrate that there\nwas an explosion at the fertility clinic and, therefore, cannot demonstrate a\ncovered peril.\u201d\n      Judgment was entered in favor of Stillwater, from which the Wongs\nfiled an appeal.\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      Summary Judgment and the Standards of Review\n      \u201cA party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if\nit is contended that the action has no merit . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c,\nsubd. (a)(1) (Section 437c).) And summary judgment will be granted \u201cif all\nthe papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d\n(Section 437c, subd. (c).)\n      A defendant \u201cmoving for summary judgment bears the burden of\npersuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that [the\ndefendant] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Aguilar v. Atlantic\nRichfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (Aguilar).) And to prevail, a\ndefendant must show that one or more elements of the challenged cause of\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\faction cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to it. (Id. at\np. 849; Merrill v. Navegar, Inc. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476\u2212477.)\n        We review a \u201cgrant of summary judgment de novo; we must decide\nindependently whether the facts not subject to triable dispute warrant\njudgment for the moving party as a matter of law. [Citations.]\u201d (Intel\nCorp. v. Hamidi (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1342, 1348.) Put another way, we exercise\nour independent judgment, and decide whether undisputed facts have been\nestablished that negate plaintiff\u2019s claims. (Romano v. Rockwell Internat., Inc.\n(1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 487.) As we put it in Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Bay Cruise\nCorp. v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320: \u201c[W]e exercise an\nindependent review to determine if the defendant moving for summary\njudgment met its burden of establishing a complete defense or of negating\neach of the plaintiff\u2019s theories and establishing that the action was without\nmerit.\u201d (Accord, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court\n(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945, 972.)\n        \u201cWe accept as true the facts . . . in the evidence of the party opposing\nsummary judgment and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from\nthem\u201d (Morgan v. Regents of University of California (2000) 88 Cal.App.4th\n52, 67), and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Wongs as\nthe losing parties. (Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243,\n254.)\n        Finally, there is the principle that we must affirm a summary\njudgment if it is correct on any of the grounds asserted in the trial court,\nregardless of the reasons stated by the trial court. (Oakland Raiders v.\nNational Football League (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 621, 630 [\u201cWe need not\ndefer to the trial court and are not bound by the reasons in its summary\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fjudgment ruling; we review the ruling of the trial court, not its rationale\u201d];\nGrebing v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 631, 637.)\n      As to the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the admissibility of expert testimony,\nwe review it for abuse of discretion. (Sargon Enterprises, Inc. v. University of\nSouthern California (2012) 55 Cal.4th 747, 773 (Sargon).\n      Applying those principles here leads to the conclusion that the\nsummary judgment was correct.\n      The Summary Judgment Was Correct\n      Introduction\n      The burden is on the insured \u201cto prove facts establishing the claimed\nloss falls within the coverage provided by the policy\u2019s insuring clause.\u201d (MRI,\nsupra, 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 777.) As our Supreme Court has described, the\ninsured\u2019s burden is \u201cto establish that the occurrence forming the basis of its\nclaim is within the basic scope of insurance coverage.\u201d (Aydin Corp. v. First\nState Ins. Co. (1998) 18 Cal.4th 1183, 1188.)\n      Here, as quoted, the insuring clause in the Stillwater policy provided\nthat \u201cwe insure for sudden and accidental direct physical loss to property\ndescribed in Coverage C caused by any of the following perils . . . unless the\nloss is excluded in Section I.\u201d So here, as in MRI, the \u201caccidental direct\nphysical loss requirement is part of the policy\u2019s insuring clause and\naccordingly falls within the [insured\u2019s] burden of proof.\u201d (MRI, supra,\n187 Cal.App.4th at p. 778.)\n      This, the Wongs failed to meet, beginning with their inability to\ndemonstrate a direct \u201cphysical loss.\u201d\n      No Evidence of Direct Physical Loss\n      By way of brief background, the Wongs\u2019s opposition below argued\namong other things that Stillwater had \u201cwaived\u201d any argument that \u201cthe\n\n\n                                        22\n\fembryos were not covered property,\u201d that is, that the embryos were excluded.\nStillwater never asserted\u2014not in its denial letter, not in its motion for\nsummary judgment\u2014that the embryos were \u201cnot covered property,\u201d but\nrather that the Wongs had not established that the embryos had sustained\n\u201cphysical loss.\u201d Despite that, as quoted above, the court\u2019s attachment noted\nthat \u201cthe Court issued a tentative ruling which found questions of fact on\nwhether Plaintiffs suffered property damage and whether Defendant waived\nthe issue.\u201d\n      The fact is, the Wongs did not argue below that Stillwater waived the\n\u201cphysical loss\u201d requirement. Indeed, as to this the Wongs submitted claimed\nlegal authority on the issue and also the declaration of Dr. Eyvazzadeh, the\nWongs\u2019s fertility doctor. And while the trial court noted, however passingly,\nthat somehow there was a triable issue of fact, our de novo review leads to a\ncontrary conclusion.5\n      Dr. Eyvazzadeh testified that she had requested Pacific Fertility to\nconduct a test of one of the Wongs\u2019s embryos, but that Pacific Fertility\ndeclined; and, she went on, there is \u201cno way to know\u201d whether the Wongs\u2019s\nembryos actually sustained physical damage. And having determined that\nthere is \u201cno way to know\u201d whether the Wongs\u2019s embryos had actual physical\ndamage, she deemed them to be \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201cadvised the Wongs that\nthey should consider these embryos to have been irreversible compromised,\nno longer viable, and lost.\u201d That does not create a triable issue of material\nfact as to \u201cphysical loss.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n      5 While we review a summary judgment motion by the same standards\nas the trial court, we must \u201c \u2018independently determine as a matter of law the\nconstruction and effect of the facts presented.\u2019 \u201d (Oakland Raiders v.\nNational Football League (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 572, 581.)\n                                       23\n\f      MRI, supra, 187 Cal.App.4th 766 is persuasive. The issue there\ninvolved an insured\u2019s claim under a business interruption policy for loss of\nincome as a result of claimed damage to its magnetic resonance imaging\nmachine after the machine failed to satisfactorily ramp up after it was\nramped down. The trial court granted summary judgment for State Farm, on\nthe basis that the insured could not demonstrate a \u201cphysical loss.\u201d\n      The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding as follows: \u201cIn modern policies,\n\u2018 \u201cphysical loss or damage\u2019 \u201d is typically the trigger for coverage. [Citation.]\nClearly, this threshold is met when an item of tangible property has been\n\u2018physically altered\u2019 by perils such as fire or water. [Citation.] However,\nserious questions crop up in instances when the structure of the property\nitself is unchanged to the naked eye and the insured claims its usefulness for\nits normal purposes has been destroyed or reduced. [Citation.] That the loss\nneeds to be \u2018physical,\u2019 given the ordinary meaning of the term, is \u2018widely held\nto exclude alleged losses that are intangible or incorporeal, and, thereby, to\npreclude any claim against the property insurer when the insured merely\nsuffers a detrimental economic impact unaccompanied by a distinct,\ndemonstrable, physical alteration of the property.\u2019 \u201d (Id., at pp. 778\u2212779.)\nAnd, the court added: \u201cA direct physical loss \u2018contemplates an actual change\nin insured property then in a satisfactory state, occasioned by accident or\nother fortuitous event directly upon the property causing it to become\nunsatisfactory for future use or requiring that repairs be made to make it so.\u2019\n[Citation.] . . . For loss to be covered, there must be a \u2018distinct, demonstrable,\nphysical alteration\u2019 of the property.\u201d (MRI, at p. 779, italics added.)\n      Dr. Eyvazzadeh\u2019s concession there is \u201cno way to know\u201d whether the\nWongs\u2019s embryos had actual physical damage was devastating to the Wongs\u2019s\nclaim. And her conclusion that she deemed the embryos to be \u201cworthless\u201d\n\n\n                                        24\n\fwas not a substitute for evidence that any of the embryos actually had\nundergone a physical change. Again MRI is apt: \u201cNeither diminution in\nvalue nor the cost of repair of replacement are active physical forces\u2014they\nare not the cause of the damage . . . [they are] the measure of the loss or\ndamage.\u201d (MRI, supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 780.) Put slightly differently, \u201c\n\u2018Diminution in market value\u2019 is not a \u2018peril\u2019 at all; it is a method of measuring\ndamages.\u201d (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1989)\n215 Cal.App.3d 1435, 1444.)\n      The mere possibility that the embryos had suffered physical damage\nwas insufficient to create a triable issue of fact to trigger coverage. The\nWongs had the burden of submitting evidence of actual physical alteration of\nthe embryos. They did not, instead submitting evidence that there is \u201cno way\nto know\u201d whether such damage had occurred. \u201cNo way to know\u201d was fatal to\ntheir claim, as it was in analogous cases. (See, e.g., Whittaker Corp. v.\nAllianz Underwriters, Inc. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1241\u22121244 [insured\nconceded that it was \u201cimpossible to determine\u201d when damage happened, and\nthus could not meet burden of proving damage occurred \u201cduring the policy\nperiod\u201d]; Collin v. American Empire Ins. Co. (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 787, 807\n[insureds conceded they \u201cdo not know what happened to their property,\u201d and\nthus could not meet burden of proving loss was caused by \u201caccident\u201d as\nrequired by policy].)6\n\n\n      6 In a brief sentence in their opposition below, the Wongs argued that\nthe Stillwater policy defines the term \u201cproperty damage\u201d to include \u201closs of\ntangible property.\u201d But the term \u201cproperty damage\u201d does not appear\nanywhere in Section I of the policy, which is the section that provides\ncoverage for the insured\u2019s own property. Rather, the term \u201cproperty damage\u201d\nappears only in Section II of the policy, the section that provides coverage\nwhen a third-party makes a liability claim against an insured. Thus, the\nWongs\u2019s assertion they sustained a \u201closs of use\u201d of the embryos was irrelevant\n                                       25\n\f      The Wongs\u2019s opening brief does not address at all this aspect of\nStillwater\u2019s motion, the Wongs\u2019s failure to demonstrate \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d\nStillwater argued this issue its respondent\u2019s brief. And in its reply brief the\nWongs assert that if the trial judge had ruled for Stillwater on this point, it\nwould have been an abuse of discretion\u2014which, of course, is not the test.\n      But beyond that, the sum total of the Wongs\u2019s argument in their reply\nbrief is a page-and-a-half passage under the heading that \u201cThe Eyvazzadeh\ndeclaration demonstrated the physical loss of the Wongs\u2019[s] embryos,\u201d which\nis followed by this brief argument:\n      \u201cStillwater argues that a separate basis exists for supporting summary\njudgment, namely that the Eyvazzadeh declaration did not show that the\nWongs had suffered physical loss to their embryos under the policy. This is a\nspecious claim, and it was not embraced by the lower court.\n      \u201cThe only evidence in this case, from the Wongs\u2019s fertility physician,\nDr. Eyvazzadeh, is that the Wongs\u2019s embryos were physically and crucially\naltered, whether the cell walls of the enclosed genetic material, rendering\nthem \u2018worthless\u2019 to any prospective parents who undergo fertility treatment\nand embryo cryogenic storage for the express purpose of a healthy birth. . . .\n[\u00b6] A determination of non-viability is as \u2018distinct, demonstrable [and]\nphysical [an] alteration\u2019 as there can be to living tissue, \u2018causing it to become\nunsatisfactory for future use.\u2019 \u201d (MRI, supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 779.)7\n\n\nto the property claim under Section I of the policy, which required that there\nbe \u201cphysical loss\u201d as distinguished from \u201cproperty damage.\u201d (See Warner v.\nFire Ins. Exchange (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1032 [insureds improperly\nfailed to distinguish between first-party property coverage and third-party\nliability coverage].)\n      7Curiously, despite Dr. Eyvazzadeh\u2019s testimony about \u201cno way to\nknow,\u201d at another point in her declaration she indicates that perhaps there\nwas a \u201cway to know.\u201d That is, in paragraph 10 of her declaration Dr.\n                                       26\n\f      This does not support a direct \u201cphysical loss.\u201d\n      No Evidence of Any Specified Peril\n      The Stillwater policy was, as noted, a \u201cspecified perils\u201d policy.\nAccording to the leading California insurance commentary, the significance of\nthis is the insured has \u201cthe threshold burden of proving the loss was caused\nby a specifically-enumerated peril.\u201d (Croskey, supra, Cal. Practice Guide:\nInsurance Litigation \u00b6 6:253.2.) As our colleagues in Division One have\ndescribed it, \u201cin litigation, \u2018 \u201c. . . the burden is on the insured to prove that an\nevent is a claim within the scope of the basic coverage.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Only\nafter \u2018the insured shows that an event falls within the scope of basic coverage\nunder the policy\u2019 [citation] does the burden shift to the insurer to prove the\nclaim is specifically excluded. [Citation.]\u201d (Central Nat. Ins. Co. v. Superior\nCourt (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 926, 932\u2212933; see generally CACI No. 2306,\ninstructions for use: [\u201c[F]or \u2018named perils\u2019 policies . . . the insured bears the\nburden of proving the loss was caused by the specified peril\u201d].)\n      Here, as noted, the Wongs\u2019s position was that the loss was caused by an\n\u201cexplosion,\u201d in claimed support of which they relied on the excerpt from\n\n\nEyvazzadeh explained: \u201cI have heard of others\u2019 experiences with embryos\nfrom Tank 4 that have been thawed from that tank and found to be no longer\nviable. I ordered a \u2018test\u2019 thaw of an abnormal embryo for at least three other\npatients\u2014all of these embryos were dead. While I have heard of one viable\nembryo that had thawed, I have not heard of any resulting healthy live\nbirths: by contrast, I know of one stillbirth from one embryo that survived\nthe thaw and was transferred. I asked PFC to do a test thaw of a euploid\nembryo belonging to the Wongs to see what I could observe, and they\ndeclined.\u201d\n      For reasons unexplained in the record, whatever might, or could, have\nbeen done on behalf of the Wongs was not done. And absent further expert\ntestimony, it would be scientifically inappropriate to extrapolate anything\npertinent to the Wongs\u2019 embryos from the fact that embryos \u201cfor at least\nthree other patients . . . were dead.\u201d\n\n                                         27\n\fDr. Kasbekar\u2019s unsigned deposition in the Colorado lawsuit. The trial court\nultimately ruled the excerpt inadmissible, and granted Stillwater\u2019s motion.\nThis was correct. Before setting out the reasons why, we begin with some\ndiscussion of explosion, both in general and specifically as described in cases\ninvolving insurance.\n      Explosion is defined as \u201ca violent expansion or bursting that is\naccompanied by noise and is caused by a sudden release of energy.\u201d\n(Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1976).) As Dictionary.com defines it,\n[\u201c[A]n act or instance of exploding; a violent expansion or bursting with noise,\nas of gunpowder or a boiler (opposed to implosion); [\u00b6] [T]he noise itself: The\nloud explosion woke them. [\u00b6] [A] violent outburst, as of laughter or anger; [\u00b6]\n[A] sudden, rapid, or great increase: a population explosion; [\u00b6] [T]he\nburning of the mixture of fuel and air in an internal-combustion engine\u201d].)\n(Dictionary.com \uf03chttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/explosion\uf03e [as of June\n29, 2023].)\n      The California Encyclopedia describes it this way: \u201cAn \u2018explosion\u2019 has\nbeen defined as a sudden, accidental, violent bursting, breaking, or expansion\ncaused by an internal force or pressure, which may be and usually is\naccompanied by some noise. Similarly, it has been said that a common\ncharacteristic of an explosion is the sudden breaking of a confined substance,\nwith varying degrees of violence, from its confinement as a result of an\ninternal pressure. It has also been characterized as a rapid, sudden, and\nviolent expansion of air or relinquishment of energy, causing a rupture and\naccompanied by a loid noise, not necessarily extremely loud.\u201d (31 A Cal.Jur\n3d Explosions and Explosures.)\n      Turning to insurance cases, \u201cexplosion\u201d is \u201cwhat ordinary men, not\nscientists,\u201d understand it to be. (Roma Wine Co. v. Hardware Mut. Fire Ins.\n\n\n                                       28\n\fCo. (1939) 31 Cal.App.2d 455, 458.) As the United States Supreme Court\nlong ago put it, \u201cWhen the word \u2018explosion\u2019 [is] used in the policy, [the\nparties] are presumed to have understood the word \u2018explosion\u2019 in its ordinary\nand popular sense. Not what some scientific man would define to be an\nexplosion, but what the ordinary man would understand to be meant by that\nword.\u201d (Mitchell v. Potomac Insurance Co. (1901) 183 U.S. 42, 52.) As a\nleading insurance commentary puts it, an \u201cexplosion\u201d is \u201ccommonly defined\nas a sudden and rapid combustion, causing a violent expansion of the air and\naccompanied by a report or sound, and is caused by a sudden release of\nenergy from an escape of gas or vapors under pressure.\u201d (10A Couch on\nInsurance (3d ed. 2022) \u00a7 150.6.)\n      By contrast, there is what Dr. Kasbekar first mentioned in his\nexchange with counsel at his deposition\u2014implosion. Implosion is defined as\n\u201cthe act of imploding; a bursting inward (opposed to explosion).\u201d\n(Dictionary.com \uf03chttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/implosion\uf03e [as of June\n29, 2023].) \u201cImplosion is a process in which objects are destroyed by\ncollapsing (or being squeezed in) on themselves. The opposite of explosion\n(which expands the volume), implosion reduces the volume occupied and\nconcentrates matter and energy.\u201d (Wikipedia.com, The Free Encyclopedia\n\uf03chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/implosion_(mechanical_process)\uf03e [as of June\n29, 2023].)\n      Against that background, what the Wongs put before the court here\u2014\nsome selected pages from the 185-page deposition of Dr. Kasbekar\u2014was\nunavailing. For reasons both substantive and procedural.\n      To begin with, there is nothing in the passage on which the Wongs rely\nthat unequivocally demonstrates that Dr. Kasbekar had an opinion that\nexplosion was the cause, especially when he began by reference to\n\n\n                                       29\n\f\u201cimplosion.\u201d As he put it, \u201cSo my opinion really is I would call it an explosion\nof the vacuum space, but I think it\u2019s fair to also call it an implosion of the\ninner wall of the tank.\u201d He certainly did not testify to any \u201cloud noise\u201d\u2014nor\nfor that matter did anyone from Pacific Fertility, where any \u201cloud noise\u201d\nwould certainly have been heard. In short, we question that the excerpt from\nDr. Kasbekar\u2019s unsigned deposition in the Colorado case was worthy of\nconsideration at all, especially in light of the significant gatekeeper function\nrequired of the trial court in handling issues of expert testimony.\n      For example, Sargon holds that a court may review not only the kind of\nmaterial relied on by the expert but also whether the matter supports the\nexpert\u2019s analysis. (Sargon, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 771\u2212772.) Here, we have\nto ask, whether there even was any \u201canalysis.\u201d After all, after Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s\nimplosion/explosion ambiguity and vacillation, it was the questioning\nattorney who said, \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s use the word \u2018explosion.\u2019 \u201d\n      As our colleagues in Division Four recently confirmed, \u201cTrial courts\nhave a \u2018substantial \u201cgatekeeping\u201d responsibility\u2019 in excluding unreliable\nexpert testimony. (Sargon, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 769.) This is to \u2018ensure\nthat an expert\u2019s opinion is based on both reliable material and sound\nreasoning.\u2019 (Bader v. Johnson & Johnson (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1094, 1104.)\u201d\n(Onglyza Product Cases (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 776, 784 (Onglyza).) Again,\nwe ask, where is the \u201csound reasoning?\u201d\n      Other divisions in this District have affirmed summary judgments for\ndefendants where the trial courts have excluded the proffered expert\ntestimony. For example, there is San Francisco Print Media Co. v. The\nHearst Corp. (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 952, 961\u2212962, where the court observed\nthat \u201cuninformed reliance on . . . analysis [was] not the mark of an opinion\nrooted in sound logic.\u201d Likewise, Onglyza, supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at\n\n\n                                        30\n\fpages 784 to 785. As another District tersely put it, \u201cexpert opinion that does\nnot contain \u2018a reasoned explanation illuminating why the facts have\nconvinced the expert\u2019 need not be relied on.\u201d (Taylor v. Trimble (2017) 13\nCal.App.5th 934, 945, fn. 15.) Such descriptions aptly fit the Dr. Kasbekar\nmaterial here.\n      Indeed, as Dr. Kasbekar put it some 53 pages later in his deposition,\n\u201cyou have that type of explosion, as we\u2019re calling it.\u201d8 And as to \u201cthat type of\nexplosion,\u201d it should be recalled how Dr. Kasbekar described it: \u201cI really look\nat it more as if the vacuum space becomes a balloon and nitrogen gas\nexpands within that vacuum space or balloon, you\u2019re exploding that vacuum\nspace. The outside wall is more robust than the inside wall, so the damage\noccurs to the inside wall.\u201d Such \u201copinion\u201d was not \u201cexplosion\u201d as the\ninsurance cases would have it, as understood by the ordinary man, not the\nscientist. (Roma Wine Co. v. Hardware Mut Fire Ins. Co, supra,\n31 Cal.App.2d at p. 458.) That \u201copinion\u201d was not one worthy of admission.\n      But even if the exchange between Dr. Kasbekar and counsel could pass\nmuster as something that could raise a triable issue of material fact, it did\nnot\u2014because it was inadmissible.\n      By way of brief background, in its reply to the Wongs\u2019s opposition\nStillwater objected to the Dr. Kasbekar material as hearsay and lacking\n\n\n      8   The actual exchange at the deposition was this:\n      \u201cQ. And is your theory and your assumption that there was a\ncatastrophic vacuum loss in Tank 4, right?\n      \u201cA. I wouldn\u2019t call it an assumption. You can call it a theory, but I\nthink there\u2019s pretty good evidence that there was a sudden vacuum loss. I\ncan\u2019t\u2014and I\u2019ve tried to envision another way that you have that type of\nexplosion, as we\u2019re calling it, that results in that type of deformation of the\ntank.\u201d\n\n                                        31\n\ffoundation. The trial court sustained that objection. The Wongs do not take\nissue with that ruling, indeed admitting, as they put it in their reply brief,\nthey \u201cdo not dispute that the Kasbekar deposition transcript itself is\ninadmissible as hearsay.\u201d Stillwater\u2019s reply did not object to the Dr.\nKasbekar material on the grounds he was an undisclosed expert, as the date\nthe Wongs had specified for designation of experts had not passed, so any\nsuch objection would have been premature. The Wongs assert that Stillwater\nobjected on \u201ca single basis: hearsay,\u201d and go on to assert that: \u201cThe court\ngranted Stillwater\u2019s motion for summary judgment . . . on the basis of two\nobjections Stillwater had not made and had therefore waived: i.e., (1) that\nPlaintiffs had failed to identify Kasbekar in an expert disclosure and that\ntherefore his testimony was inadmissible at trial as hearsay . . . .\u201d This is\nless than candid.\n      At the hearing, counsel for Stillwater stated that the Wongs \u201cdid not\nserve any deposition experts . . . [so] what we have now with this deposition\ntestimony from another case is testimony from an . . . expert who can\u2019t\ntestify.\u201d At that point the court interrupted, to \u201cstop you there . . . because I\nagree with you and that\u2019s the Perry case.\u201d (Perry, supra, 2 Cal.5th 536.)\nBeyond that, the trial court expressly found that Stillwater \u201cproperly\nobjected\u201d to Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s testimony. And properly ruled it inadmissible.\n      It is undisputed that the Wongs served a demand for exchange of\nexpert witness information; that Stillwater served a designation of experts;\nthat the Wongs never served a designation of experts; and the Wongs never\nfiled a motion seeking relief from their failure to do so. Where any party has\nserved a demand for any exchange of expert witness information, any party\nwho intends to designate as an expert must do so in the manner specified by\nCode of Civil Procedure section 2034.260. When the Wongs served their\n\n\n                                        32\n\fdemand, the Wongs themselves became obligated to serve either a\ndesignation of experts or a statement that they did not intend to offer any\nexpert testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2034.260 subds. (a) and (b).) They did\nnot.\n       Perry, supra, 2 Cal.5th 536 is on point. There, plaintiff Perry sued a\nproperty owner and its tenant, claiming he was injured in a fall on the\nowners\u2019 property that the tenant leased. The owner moved for summary\njudgment, and in opposition plaintiff submitted the declarations of two\nexperts opining that the stairs he fell on were in disrepair and did not comply\nwith building code and industry standards. The trial court sustained the\nowner\u2019s objection to the declarations because plaintiff had failed to disclose\nthe experts, and granted summary judgment for the owner.\n       The Court of Appeal affirmed. And the Supreme Court affirmed the\nCourt of Appeal, holding that \u201cwhen the court determines an expert opinion\nis inadmissible because disclosure requirements were not met, the opinion\nmust be excluded from consideration at summary judgment if an objection is\nraised.\u201d (Perry, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 538.) As the leading practice treatise\nputs it: A party opposing a motion for summary judgment \u201cmay not use\ndeclarations of experts not previously disclosed if the time for disclosure\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.210 et seq. has expired.\u201d (Weil &\nBrown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group\n2023) \u00b6 10:206.)\n       In an effort to avoid the consequences of their failure to designate Dr.\nKasbekar, the Wongs argue they could have used Dr. Kasbekar as a\npercipient witness, because he examined Tank 4 at some point after its\nfailure and could testify that it had been damaged by an \u201cexplosion.\u201d Such\nattempt to recharacterize Dr. Kasbekar as a percipient witness rings hollow\n\n\n                                       33\n\fin light of the fact that the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the Colorado case\nhired Dr. Kasbekar to provide an expert opinion\u2014not to mention that the\nWongs themselves attempted to hire him.\n      But even if Dr. Kasbekar is characterized as a non-retained expert, the\nselected pages from his unsigned Colorado deposition would not meet the\nrequirements of California summary judgment law. Specifically:\n      Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (b)(2) provides that a\nparty may oppose a motion for summary judgment with, among other things,\n\u201caffidavits, declarations, [and] depositions . . . .\u201d The excerpts from the\nColorado deposition did not qualify as any of these under California law. The\ntranscript of Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s testimony was not an \u201caffidavit,\u201d which is\ndefined as a \u201cwritten declaration under oath, made without notice to the\nadverse party.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2003.) But, \u201ca transcript of . . . testimony\nis not a \u2018written declaration under oath.\u2019 \u201d (Sweetwater, supra, 6 Cal.5th at\np. 942, original italics.) Moreover, the unsigned transcript was not a\n\u201cdeclaration,\u201d because \u201ca declaration must be signed and recite that the\nperson making it certifies it to be true under penalty of perjury.\u201d (Id., at\np. 941.)\n      Finally, Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s Colorado deposition was not a \u201cdeposition\u201d in\nthe Wongs\u2019s case against Stillwater because Dr. Kasbekar\u2019s testimony was\nnot taken after notice to Stillwater. Code of Civil Procedure section 2004\ndefines a \u201cdeposition\u201d as \u201ca written declaration, under oath, made upon notice\nto the adverse party, for the purpose of enabling him to attend and cross-\nexamine.\u201d Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.620 provides that\n\u201c[a]t the trial or any other hearing in the action, any part or all of a\ndeposition may be used against any party who was present or represented at\nthe taking of the deposition, or who had due notice of the deposition . . . .\u201d In\n\n\n                                        34\n\fshort, for purposes of making or opposing a motion under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 437c, a \u201cdeposition\u201d can only mean a deposition taken after\nnotice to the parties in the same action in which summary judgment is\nsought. The Colorado deposition was not that.\n      Lastly, in their reply brief the Wongs seek to salvage the\ninadmissibility of the Dr. Kasbekar material by asserting something they\nhave never asserted before, which is this: \u201cSecond, the correct legal standard\nis not whether Kasbekar himself would be present at trial to introduce his\ndeposition testimony so as to avoid exclusion of the deposition transcript as\nhearsay but rather whether it was \u2018reasonably possible that the facts\nasserted in [his deposition testimony] can be established by admissible\nevidence,\u2019 see Sweetwater, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 948, fn. 12\u2014i.e., by anyone\u2019s\ncompetent testimony, expert or lay witness.\u201d An argument asserted for the\nfirst time in a reply brief will generally not be considered. (Raceway Ford\nCases (2016) 2 Cal.5th 161, 178; American Indian Model Schools v. Oakland\nUnified School Dist. (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 258, 275\u2212276.) In any event,\nSweetwater hardly supports such a statement.\n      Sweetwater involved contractors who allegedly had obtained\nconstruction contracts by bribing school district employees and board\nmembers. Various persons testified before a grand jury, some of whom\nultimately pled guilty or no contest to criminal charges. The pleas were in\nwriting, were accompanied by detailed written narratives of the conduct, and\nwere signed under penalty of perjury.\n      The school district then sued the contractors seeking to void the\nconstruction contracts and obtain disgorgement of funds previously paid the\ncontractors. The contractors filed an anti-SLAPP motion, which the school\ndistrict opposed, partly with excerpts of the grand jury testimony of some\n\n\n                                        35\n\fwitnesses and partly with the written pleas and written narratives that had\nbeen signed under penalty of perjury. The trial court overruled defendants\u2019\nobjections, and the Court of Appeal affirmed. So too the Supreme Court,\nwhich held that when ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court \u201cmay\nconsider statements that are the equivalent of affidavits and declarations\nbecause they were made under oath or penalty of perjury in California\u201d and\nthat the \u201cplea forms, factual narratives, and the excerpts from the grand jury\ntestimony satisfy this requirement.\u201d (Sweetwater, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 945.)\nThis was in light of the court\u2019s observation that \u201c[T]he important aspect of\nsuch evidence is that it be made under penalty of California\u2019s perjury laws.\u201d\n(Id., at p. 943.)\n      The grand jury testimony at issue in Sweetwater satisfied this\nrequirement because the testimony was taken in California and was subject\nto California\u2019s perjury laws, and for the additional reason that the documents\ncontained express statements they were signed under penalty of perjury in\nCalifornia. This is not true of the Dr. Kasbekar material.\n      Indeed, we note that if we understand the Wongs\u2019s argument, it would\nmean that regardless of the hearsay, regardless of its source, a person\nopposing summary judgment could \u201ctestify\u201d as to some hearsay and then\nsearch for something admissible to support it at trial. This cannot be the law.\n      Lastly, we note, as the Wongs conceded below and trial court held, that\nbecause their breach of contract cause of action had no merit, the other\ncauses of action fail as well.\n                                 DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed. Stillwater shall recover its costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\f                                     _________________________\n                                     Richman, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nStewart, P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nMarkman, J. *\n\n\n\n\nWong v.
