See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(d). Both indictments\n\nincluded an enhancement paragraph and a habitual-offender paragraph. See id.\n\n\u00a7 12.42. The indictments alleged that both offenses occurred on the same date and\n\n\n\n\n                                         1\n\fat the same home, and there was evidence before the jury that Patterson attempted\n\nsexual assault against two people\u2014the homeowner and the homeowner\u2019s mother.\n\n      Patterson pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d in both trial causes, but the jury found Patterson\n\nguilty in both causes. Patterson pleaded \u201cnot true\u201d to the enhancement and habitual\n\nparagraphs, and after a hearing on punishment, the jury found the enhancement and\n\nhabitual allegations \u201ctrue\u201d and sentenced Patterson to fifty-five years of confinement\n\nin each cause. The trial court ordered the sentences to run concurrently. Patterson\n\ntimely filed notices of appeal in each trial cause.\n\n      Patterson\u2019s appellate counsel filed briefs that present counsel\u2019s professional\n\nevaluation of the record, and the appellate counsel concludes the appeals are without\n\nmerit and that there are no meritorious issues for appeal and no arguable grounds for\n\nreversal. See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); High v. State, 573 S.W.2d\n\n807 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978). On April 14, 2023, we granted an extension of time for\n\nPatterson to file pro se briefs, and Patterson filed pro se briefs in response.\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals has held that when a court of appeals receives\n\nan Anders brief and also a pro se brief, an appellate court has two choices. See\n\nBledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826-27 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). \u201cIt may determine\n\nthat the appeal is wholly frivolous and issue an opinion explaining that it has\n\nreviewed the record and finds no reversible error[;] [o]r, it may determine that\n\narguable grounds for appeal exist and remand the cause to the trial court so that new\n\n                                           2\n\fcounsel may be appointed to brief the issues.\u201d Id. We do not address the merits of\n\neach claim raised in an Anders brief or a pro se brief when we have determined there\n\nare no arguable grounds for review. Id. at 827.\n\n      Upon receiving an Anders brief, a court must conduct a full examination of\n\nthe record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous. Penson v. Ohio, 488\n\nU.S. 75, 80 (1988) (citing Anders, 386 U.S. at 744). We have reviewed the entire\n\nrecord in both cases, counsel\u2019s briefs, and Patterson\u2019s pro se briefs, and we have\n\nfound no reversible error, and we conclude the appeals are wholly frivolous. See\n\nBledsoe, 178 S.W.3d at 827-28 (\u201cDue to the nature of Anders briefs, by indicating\n\nin the opinion that it considered the issues raised in the briefs and reviewed the record\n\nfor reversible error but found none, the court of appeals met the requirements of\n\nTexas Rule of Appellate Procedure 47.1.\u201d). Therefore, we find it unnecessary to\n\norder appointment of new counsel to re-brief the appeals. Cf. Stafford v. State, 813\n\nS.W.2d 503, 511 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\n      The Anders briefs assert that the trial court assessed court costs of $400 in\n\nboth trial causes even though the cases were tried together. A review of the \u201cFelony\n\nCourt Cost\u201d sheet for each case shows that the fees of $400 charged in trial cause\n\n21DC-CR-00623 were also assessed in trial cause number 21DC-CR-00624. Where\n\na criminal defendant is convicted of two or more offenses in the same action, the\n\ntrial court may assess each court cost or fee only once. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\n\n                                           3\n\fAnn. art. 102.073(a). Therefore, the records show that $400 of the costs are\n\nduplicative. We affirm the judgment in trial cause number 21DC-CR-00623. And\n\nwe modify the judgment in trial cause number 21DC-CR-00624 to delete the $400\n\nin court costs and affirm that judgment as modified. See Tex. R. App. P. 43.2(b) (An\n\nappellate court may modify the trial court\u2019s judgment and affirm the judgment as\n\nmodified); Bigley v. State, 865 S.W.2d 26, 27 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (a court of\n\nappeals may modify the judgment of the court below by correcting or reforming it).1\n\n      AFFIRMED; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\n\n\n                                                   _________________________\n                                                       LEANNE JOHNSON\n                                                             Justice\n\nSubmitted on August 14, 2023\nOpinion Delivered August 30, 2023\nDo Not Publish\n\nBefore Golemon, C.J., Johnson and Wright, JJ.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n         Patterson may challenge our decision in these cases by filing petitions for\ndiscretionary review.
