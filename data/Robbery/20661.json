Defendant Prince raises on\nappeal three issues challenging his convictions. Defendant\nWhite raises on appeal two issues challenging his convictions\nand two issues challenging his sentence.\n   Beginning on or around January 2, 1991, Defendant White\ndevised and engaged in a scheme to \u201cdefraud and obtain\nmoney by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations and promises.\u201d Defendant White represented\nto certain individuals that he was \u201cbonded with\u201d the U.S.\nBankruptcy Court and that this enabled him to buy assets\ninvolved in bankruptcies which he could then sell for a\nsizeable profit. Defendants Prince and White solicited\nindividuals to invest in their alleged plan to purchase and then\nsell these assets. Investors contributed money for purchasing\nproperty and for covering alleged costs associated with\npurchasing property involved in bankruptcies, e.g., taxes,\naccountant fees, closing costs, etc. The government\n\f50   United States v.

The district court found that          According to the evidence presented at trial, Defendants\nthe victim impact statements used in the preparation of the       physically obtained investors\u2019 money through one of three\npresentence investigation report were more accurate than the      types of arrangements.

The court noted that the          directed investors to wire transfer the money into the bank\nreferenced pieces were incomplete and often taken out of          accounts of third parties. Per a pre-arranged agreement with\ncontext, and that some testimony related to a time midway in      either or both Defendants, the third party wrote a check in the\nthe scheme. The court found that the victim impact                amount of the transfer, cashed that check, and then transferred\nstatements clearly supported a conclusion that the probation      the money in cash to Defendant Prince.

Id. In rejecting this argument, the\n and usually closed bank accounts after a short period of      Fourth Circuit held that the transfer from the lenders to\n time. Thus, defendant\u2019s actions are much closer to the        Lagusa was effected pursuant to a scheme to defraud, which\n heartland of the money laundering statute because those       Smith participated in and devised. Id. at 1266. Smith was in\n actions manifest a desire on his part to conceal the          constructive control of the entire scheme and was therefore in\n source, flow and destination of unlawfully obtained           constructive possession and control of the fraudulently\n funds.                                                        procured funds at the time those funds were transferred in\n    \u2018Because the defendant\u2019s conduct here is readily           violation of the money laundering statute.
