Cons. Stat.\n\u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii), qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined\nby U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The District Court was correct and so\nwe will affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n        In 2019, police officers stopped Henderson due to a\ntraffic violation, searched his vehicle, and found a loaded semi-\nautomatic firearm with an obliterated serial number and\nthirteen rounds of ammunition. Henderson was indicted for,\nand pled guilty to, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At the time of the\noffense, Henderson had a prior state robbery conviction under\n18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii).\n\n        At sentencing, the District Court applied the sentencing\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) based on\nHenderson\u2019s robbery conviction. The Court concluded that:\n(1) \u00a7 3701(a) is divisible and Henderson was convicted of\nviolating subsection (ii) of the statute; and (2) subsection (ii)\nqualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)\nbecause the subsection provides that a person is guilty of\nrobbery if he \u201cthreatens another with or intentionally puts him\nin fear of immediate serious bodily injury,\u201d App. 109 (quoting\n18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii)), 120, which means a\nviolation of the subsection necessarily \u201crequires the purposeful\nuse or threat of physical force against another,\u201d App. 109, 120.\n\n       Based on this prior conviction, Henderson\u2019s base\noffense level was twenty. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4). This\noffense level was increased by four because the firearm he\n\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\fpossessed      had     an    obliterated     serial    number,\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B), and reduced by three for\nacceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a\ntotal offense level of twenty-one. Given his criminal history\ncategory of IV, his Guideline range was fifty-seven to seventy-\none months\u2019 imprisonment. The Court imposed a sentence of\nsixty months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised\nrelease.\n\n       Henderson appeals.\n\n                               II1\n\n                                A\n\n        A defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) faces an\nenhanced base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines\nif he has a prior felony conviction of \u201ceither a crime of violence\nor a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2),\n(a)(4)(A). The Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as\n\n       any offense under federal or state law,\n       punishable by imprisonment for a term\n       exceeding one year, that\u2014\n\n       1\n         The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\nand 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We review the District Court\u2019s factual\nfindings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo,\nUnited States v. Lowe, 791 F.3d 424, 427 (3d Cir. 2015),\nincluding the Court\u2019s determination that a conviction\nconstitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines, United\nStates v. Chapman, 866 F.3d 129, 131 (3d Cir. 2017).\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f              (1) has as an element the use, attempted\n              use, or threatened use of physical force\n              against the person of another, or\n\n              (2) is murder, voluntary manslaughter,\n              kidnapping, aggravated assault, a forcible\n              sex offense, robbery, arson, extortion, or\n              the use or unlawful possession of a\n              firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a)\n              or explosive material as defined in 18\n              U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c).\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The first section is known as the\n\u201celements clause,\u201d and the second section is known as the\n\u201cenumerated offenses clause.\u201d United States v. Ramos, 892\nF.3d 599, 605 (3d Cir. 2018).\n\n        To decide whether an offense constitutes a crime of\nviolence, we apply the \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d which requires\n\u201ccompar[ing] the elements of the statute under which the\ndefendant was convicted to the [G]uidelines\u2019 definition of\ncrime of violence.\u201d Id. at 606 (quotations and citation\nomitted). If the statute forming the basis of the defendant\u2019s\nconviction necessarily has as an element \u201cthe use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against another\nperson,\u201d or if its elements substantially correspond to the\nelements of one of the enumerated offenses, then the statute\nproscribes a predicate crime of violence within the meaning of\nthe Guidelines. Id.; United States v. Brasby, 61 F.4th 127, 134\n(3d Cir. 2023). If, however, the statute of conviction lacks\nsuch an element, it \u201csweeps more broadly\u201d than the Guidelines\ndefinition and does not qualify as a crime of violence, even if\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\fthe defendant actually committed the offense by using,\nattempting to use, or threatening to use physical force against\nanother person. Ramos, 892 F.3d at 606 (citation omitted).\nThus, we \u201cnot only [] ignore the actual manner in which the\ndefendant committed the prior offense, but also [] presume that\nthe defendant did so by engaging in no more than \u2018the\nminimum conduct criminalized by the state statute.\u2019\u201d Id.\n(quoting Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 191 (2013)).\n\n       When a statute \u201clist[s] elements in the alternative, and\nthereby define[s] multiple crimes,\u201d it is divisible, and we must\nidentify which of the alternate elements was the basis for the\nconviction. Mathis v. United States, 579 U.S. 500, 505-06\n(2016). Under this \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d we\nidentify the statutory offense of conviction by looking at a\n\u201cspecific set of extra-statutory documents,\u201d such as the\n\u201ccharging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea\ncolloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge.\u201d\nRamos, 892 F.3d at 606-07.\n\n       Thus, we must first determine whether the Pennsylvania\nrobbery statute is divisible. If it is divisible, then we must\nidentify the provision that formed the basis of Henderson\u2019s\nconviction, and thereafter determine whether that provision\nconstitutes a crime of violence under the elements clause or\nenumerated offenses clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\f                               B\n\n       Under Pennsylvania law, a person commits robbery, if\n\u201cin the course of committing a theft,\u201d2 he:\n\n       (i) inflicts serious bodily injury upon another;\n\n       (ii) threatens another with or intentionally puts\n       him in fear of immediate serious bodily injury;\n\n       (iii) commits or threatens immediately to commit\n       any felony of the first or second degree;\n\n       (iv) inflicts bodily injury upon another or\n       threatens another with or intentionally puts him\n       in fear of immediate bodily injury;\n\n       (v) physically takes or removes property from\n       the person of another by force however slight; or\n\n       (vi) takes or removes the money of a financial\n       institution . . . .\n\n18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3701(a)(1). \u201cTheft means taking someone\nelse\u2019s property intending not to give it back.\u201d Pa. Suggested\nStandard Criminal Jury Instructions 15.3701A. Robbery under\nsubsections (i)\u2013(iii) are first-degree felonies, robbery under\nsubsections (iv) and (vi) are second-degree felonies, and\n\n       2\n         \u201cAn act shall be deemed \u2018in the course of committing\na theft\u2019 if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft or in flight\nafter the attempt or commission.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n\u00a7 3701(a)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\frobbery under subsection (v) is a third-degree felony. 18 Pa.\nCons. Stat. \u00a7 3701(b)(1). These various felony levels carry\ndifferent penalties.3\n\n        The subsections of \u00a7 3701(a)(1) are not separate means\nof satisfying a specific element, but rather \u201cclearly la[y] out\nalternative elements\u201d for separate robbery offenses.4 United\nStates v. Peppers, 899 F.3d 211, 232 (3d Cir. 2018) (citation\nomitted) (holding \u00a7 3701 divisible); see also United States v.\nBlair, 734 F.3d 218, 225 (3d Cir. 2013) (same). Moreover, the\nfact that the various subsections trigger different penalties\nshows that they are alternative elements that must be proven.\nMathis, 579 U.S. at 518 (\u201cIf statutory alternatives carry\ndifferent punishments . . . they must be elements.\u201d). For these\nreasons, \u00a7 3701 is divisible. Peppers, 899 F.3d at 232; Blair,\n734 F.3d at 225.\n\n      3\n          First-degree felonies are subject to a maximum term\nof twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 1103(1).\nSecond-degree felonies are subject to a maximum term of ten\nyears\u2019 imprisonment. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 1103(2). Third-\ndegree felonies are subject to a maximum term of seven years\u2019\nimprisonment. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 1103(3).\n        4\n           Henderson argues on appeal that \u00a7 3701 is not\ndivisible, but he withdrew his divisibility argument before the\nDistrict Court and conceded at sentencing that the statute is\ndivisible.     Although Henderson failed to preserve his\nchallenge, Barna v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Panther Valley Sch.\nDist., 877 F.3d 136, 146-47 &amp; n.7 (3d Cir. 2017) (explaining a\nclaim is \u201cwaived\u201d when intentionally abandoned, and \u201cmay not\nbe resurrected on appeal\u201d), the categorical approach requires\nthat we determine whether \u00a7 3701 is divisible to ensure we are\nexamining the actual crime of conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\f       Because \u00a7 3701 is divisible, we apply the \u201cmodified\ncategorical approach,\u201d which allows us to consider \u201cextra-\nstatutory documents\u201d to identify the subsection under which\nHenderson was convicted. Ramos, 892 F.3d at 606-07. The\nparties do not dispute that Henderson was convicted under\nsubsection (ii). As a result, we next examine whether\nsubsection (ii) of the Pennsylvania robbery statute is a crime of\nviolence under either \u00a7 4B1.2(a)\u2019s elements clause or its\nenumerated offenses clause.\n\n                               C\n\n       To qualify as a crime of violence under the elements\nclause, the offense must have \u201cas an element the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person of\nanother.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). For subsection (ii) to meet\nthis definition, (1) a defendant must threaten to use physical\nforce, Ramos, 892 F.3d at 611, and (2) the threat must be made\nintentionally or knowingly, Borden v. United States, 141 S. Ct.\n1817, 1826 (2021).5 As we will explain, subsection (ii) meets\nboth requirements and thus qualifies as a crime of violence.\n\n       5\n        Borden addressed the elements clause of the ACCA,\nwhich is identical to the elements clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). See\n18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Given their similarity, \u201ccourts\ngenerally apply authority interpreting one provision to the\nother.\u201d United States v. Brasby, 61 F.4th 127, 133 (3d Cir.\n2023).\n\n       Borden left open the question of whether offenses\nrequiring a mental state of \u201cextreme recklessness\u201d satisfy the\nelements clause. 141 S. Ct. at 1825 n.4. Because this is an\n\n\n\n\n                                   9\n\f                               1\n\n       The first question is whether a theft where a defendant\n\u201cthreatens another with or intentionally puts him in fear of\nimmediate serious bodily injury,\u201d 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n\u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii), involves the threatened use of physical force\nagainst another. Section 4B1.2(a)(1) envisions the requisite\n\u201cuse of physical force\u201d as \u201cforce capable of causing physical\npain or injury.\u201d Stokeling v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 544, 553\n(2019) (quotations omitted).\n\n       The plain language of subsection (ii) satisfies this\nrequirement. The statute states that the threatened force must\nplace the victim in fear of immediate \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d\nPennsylvania defines \u201c[b]odily injury\u201d as an \u201c[i]mpairment of\nphysical condition or substantial pain,\u201d and \u201c[s]erious bodily\ninjury\u201d as \u201c[b]odily injury which creates a substantial risk of\ndeath or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or\nprotracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily\nmember or organ.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 2301. Because\nsubsection (ii) requires proof that the victim was threatened\nwith, or put in fear of, immediate serious bodily injury, it\ncontemplates a level of force that is capable of causing physical\npain or injury and therefore satisfies the force provision of\n\u00a7 4B1.2(a)\u2019s elements clause. Cf. United States v. McCants,\n952 F.3d 416, 428 (3d Cir. 2020) (holding textually similar\n\n\n\nopen question, we do not address it here and focus our analysis\non whether robbery under subsection (ii) requires that the\noffense be committed intentionally or knowingly.\n\n\n\n\n                                   10\n\fNew Jersey robbery statute qualified as crime of violence\nbecause it required a threat of \u201cbodily injury\u201d).6\n\n       6\n         United States v. Harris, 289 A.3d 1060 (Pa. 2023), and\nits conclusion that Pennsylvania\u2019s aggravated assault statute\ndoes not require force, is not applicable. In Harris, the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court explained that the aggravated\nassault statute did not contain a requirement of force and thus\ncould be violated by an omission. Id. at 1074. The court\nobserved that the aggravated assault statute does not identify\nthe \u201cmanner of causing a particular bodily injury,\u201d instead\nproviding only that a defendant must \u201ccause\u201d such injury. Id.\nat 1070-71. Like the statutes Harris distinguished from\naggravated assault, such as an \u201cattempt[] by physical menace\u201d\nto put others in fear of bodily injury, subsection (ii)\ncriminalizes a specific act. As we explain in the following\nsection, subsection (ii)\u2019s \u201cthreaten another\u201d language identifies\nthe act in which the defendant must engage, namely a\ndeclaration directed toward another. Thus, because subsection\n(ii) identifies the manner by which the harm must be caused, it\ndiffers from the aggravated assault statute. By identifying the\nact, subsection (ii) robbery cannot be committed by omission.\n\n        Furthermore, unlike the aggravated assault statute,\nsubsection (ii) requires that the victim be threatened with or\nplaced in fear of \u201cimmediate\u201d serious bodily injury. Harris is\nalso distinguishable because in its examination of\nPennsylvania\u2019s aggravated assault statute it relied on a case in\nwhich a mother was charged with aggravated assault through\nan act of omission (i.e., starving a child to death), but such an\nact would not satisfy the immediacy requirement in subsection\n(ii). In the same way, a theft where a nursing home caretaker\nwho threatens to withhold medication necessary to prevent\n\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\f                                2\n\n       The second question is whether subsection (ii) requires\nproof that the defendant acted with a knowing or intentional\nstate of mind. Subsection (ii) prohibits, in the course of\ncommitting a theft, \u201cthreaten[ing] another with or intentionally\nput[ting] him in fear of immediate serious bodily injury.\u201d 18\nPa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii). The second clause of\nsubsection (ii) explicitly provides for an intentional state of\nmind by making it a crime to \u201cintentionally put[] [another] in\nfear of immediate serious bodily injury.\u201d Id. The first clause\n\nadverse medical consequences unless the patient gave the\ncaretaker money would not satisfy the immediacy\nrequirement. For this additional reason, Harris is not\napplicable.\n\n        This result is confirmed by applying the realistic\nprobability test. Having found that subsection (ii) satisfies\n4B1.2(a)(1)\u2019s requisite quantum of force, to demonstrate that\nsubsection (ii) is yet still broader than \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1),\nHenderson must show a \u201crealistic probability, not a theoretical\npossibility, that the State would apply its statute\u201d to a threat of\nimmediate serious bodily injury by omission. Moncrieffe v.\nHolder, 569 U.S. 184, 191 (2013). To show such a realistic\nprobability, \u201can offender must at least point to his own case or\nother cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute\nin the special [] manner for which he argues.\u201d Gonzales v.\nDuenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 193 (2007).                 Because\nHenderson has failed to identify any case in which\nPennsylvania applied subsection (ii) to threats of immediate\nserious bodily injury by omission, we hold that subsection (ii)\nis not broader than \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\flacks the word \u201cintentionally,\u201d stating only that a person is\nguilty of a robbery if he \u201cthreatens another with . . . immediate\nserious bodily injury.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii). The\ntext, structure, and case law, however, show that the first clause\nalso captures an intentional or knowing mens rea.\n\n       A term in a statute \u201cis given more precise content by the\nneighboring words with which it is associated.\u201d United States\nv. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 294 (2008). The Supreme Court\napplied this principle in Borden, where the Court considered\ntwo different interpretations of the phrase \u201cuse of physical\nforce against the person of another,\u201d as used in the ACCA. The\nparties agreed that the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d means the\n\u201cvolitional\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d employment of force but had different\nviews as to whether \u201cagainst the person of another\u201d had: (1) a\npassive meaning, which supported a mens rea of recklessness;\nor (2) an oppositional meaning, which supported a stricter\nmens rea. 141 S. Ct. 1817, 1825-1830 (2021). The passive\nreading would interpret \u201cagainst\u201d to mean \u201cmaking contact\nwith,\u201d e.g. \u201cwaves crashing against the shore.\u201d Id. at 1827\n(quotations omitted). The oppositional reading of \u201cagainst\u201d\nwould interpret the phrase to introduce a \u201cconscious object\u201d or\n\u201cintended target\u201d of the force, not a \u201cmere recipient\u201d of the\nforce by happenstance, e.g. \u201c[t]he general deployed his forces\nagainst a rival regiment.\u201d Id. at 1825-26. The Court adopted\nthe oppositional interpretation because \u201cagainst\u201d was paired\nwith \u201cuse of physical force,\u201d and the \u201cpairing of a volitional\naction with the word \u2018against\u2019 supports that word\u2019s\noppositional, or targeted, definition.\u201d Id. at 1826.\n\n       The same interpretation applies here.           Viewing\nsubsection (ii)\u2019s threatens clause in its entirety, the clause\n\u201cthreatens another with [] immediate serious bodily injury\u201d has\n\n\n\n\n                                   13\n\fan oppositional meaning because the language \u201canother with\u201d\nintroduces an intended target, not a mere recipient of the threat\nby happenstance.\n\n        Pennsylvania courts, which are \u201cthe ultimate\nexpositors\u201d of Pennsylvania law, support this interpretation of\n\u201cthreatens another\u201d in subsection (ii). Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421\nU.S. 684, 691 (1975); see also Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\n307, 324 n.16 (1979) (recognizing that States have the power\nto define the substantive elements of criminal offenses). Under\nPennsylvania law, the \u201ccommon and approved usage\u201d of a\nword dictates how it is construed within a statute. 1 Pa. Cons.\nStat. \u00a7 1903(a). See also Commonwealth v. Griffin, 207 A.3d\n827, 830 (Pa. 2019) (\u201c[T]he plain language of the statute itself\nprovides the clearest indication of legislative intent.\u201d). When\ndetermining a word\u2019s common meaning, Pennsylvania law\ndirects us to consult a dictionary. See e.g., Chamberlain v.\nUnemployment Comp. Bd. of Rev., 114 A.3d 385, 394 (Pa.\n2015) (\u201cIt is well-established that the common and approved\nmeaning of a word may be ascertained from an examination of\nits dictionary definition.\u201d). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defined\n\u201cthreat\u201d at the time \u00a7 3701 was enacted as \u201c[a] declaration of\nintention or determination to inflict punishment, loss, or pain\non another . . . [; a] declaration of one\u2019s purpose or intention to\nwork injury to the person, property, or rights of another.\u201d See\nThreat, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1968). Thus,\ninterpreting the \u201cthreatens another\u201d language to convey an\nintentional act, where the perpetrator knowingly states his\nintent to harm his victim, is consistent with directives found\nwithin Pennsylvania law.7\n\n       7\n        We acknowledge that the word \u201cthreat\u201d alone has\nbeen viewed as an actus reus and does \u201cnot carry its own\n\n\n\n\n                                   14\n\f       Pennsylvania case law further supports this\ninterpretation of subsection (ii). In Commonwealth v. Thomas,\n546 A.2d 116 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988), appeal denied, 554 A.2d\n509 (Pa. 1989), the state court explained that a defendant\nviolates subsection (ii) if his threat \u201cwas calculated to inflict\nfear of serious bodily injury.\u201d Id. at 118. The court\u2019s use of\nthe word \u201ccalculated\u201d suggests that, to commit a violation of\nsubsection (ii), a defendant must intend to inflict fear of serious\nbodily injury on the victim. Id. at 119.\n\n       Thus, the clause \u201cthreatens another with . . . immediate\nserious bodily injury\u201d conveys an intentional act because the\nthreat must be directed toward another person with the intent\nof causing the victim to fear serious bodily injury. See Borden,\n141 S. Ct. at 1827; Thomas, 546 A.2d at 119; see also United\nStates v. Stanford, No. 22-1272, 2023 WL 4835133 (3d Cir.\nJuly 28, 2023) (holding that Delaware robbery, 11 Del. C.\n\u00a7 831(a), qualifies as a crime of violence under the elements\nclause because it \u201crequires the intentional use or threatened use\nof immediate force \u2018upon another person,\u2019\u201d and thus involves\nforce that is \u201cconsciously directed\u201d toward a victim (quoting\n\n\nimplicit mens rea,\u201d Larios v. Att\u2019y Gen., 978 F.3d 62, 71 (3d\nCir. 2020) (citing Bovkun v. Ashcroft, 283 F.3d 166, 170 (3d\nCir. 2002)); see also Counterman v. Colorado, 143 S. Ct. 2106,\n2117-18 (2023) (recognizing that a threat is an act that does not\nembody a particular mens rea and acknowledging that a threat\nmay be committed recklessly), but here, where \u201cthreatens\u201d is\ncoupled with a word of directionality, such as \u201canother,\u201d the\nphrase \u201cthreatens another\u201d provides insight into the state of\nmind with which that threat occurs. Thus, our consideration of\nthe dictionary definition of \u201cthreat\u201d is not inconsistent with\nLarios.\n\n\n\n\n                                   15\n\fBorden, 141 S. Ct. at 1826)).8 Because the \u201cplain language of\nthe statute is the best indication of the legislature\u2019s intent,\u201d In\nre B.W., 250 A.3d 1163, 1171 (Pa. 2021), and the language of\nsubsection (ii) requires intentional conduct, we need not rely\non the Pennsylvania Criminal Code\u2019s default mens rea\nprovision to identify the applicable state of mind for violating\nsubsection (ii). We therefore conclude that subsection (ii)\nembodies an intentional mens rea.\n\n       Because subsection (ii) involves the requisite force and\nmens rea to qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s\nelements clause, we need not decide whether it is also one of\nthe crimes listed in the enumerated offenses clause. 9\n\n       8\n          Henderson asserts that reading a mens rea of intent into\nthe first clause of subsection (ii) would render the word\n\u201cintentionally\u201d in the second clause superfluous. However, the\nfirst clause\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cthreatens another\u201d addresses a\nspecific type of act, namely a communication that conveys an\nintent to harm, and therefore the legislature did not need to use\nthe word \u201cintentionally\u201d to convey a knowing or intentional\nmens rea. The second clause uses the phrase \u201cintentionally\nputs him in fear.\u201d Without the use of the word \u201cintentionally,\u201d\nconduct that \u201cputs another in fear\u201d could cover reckless\nactions. Thus, unlike the first clause, the inclusion of the word\n\u201cintentionally\u201d in the second clause is necessary to\ndemonstrate the legislature\u2019s intent to punish only knowing or\nintentional conduct.\n        9\n          Pennsylvania courts have viewed \u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii) as\n\u201csubstantially identical in nature and definition\u201d to federal\nbank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), Commonwealth v.\nTaylor, 831 A.2d 661, 665-66 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003), and we\nhave held \u00a7 2113(a) to be a crime of violence under\n\n\n\n\n                                   16\n\f                             III\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), United States v. Wilson, 880 F.3d 80, 85 (3d\nCir. 2018). This provides further support for the view that\nsubsection (ii) qualifies as a \u00a7 4B1.2(a) crime of violence.\n\n\n\n\n                                   17\n\f",
