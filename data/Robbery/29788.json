Petitioner Gary Duane Harris appeals\nfrom the district court\u2019s denial of his second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set\n\f No. 21-5040                             Harris v. United States                             Page 2\n\n\naside, or correct a portion of the 480-month sentence he presently is serving. After pleading\nguilty to aiding and abetting second-degree murder, aiding and abetting attempted robbery, and\naiding and abetting using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, the\ndistrict court sentenced Harris to concurrent sentences of 420 months and 180 months for the\nsecond-degree-murder and attempted-robbery convictions, respectively. The district court also\nimposed a consecutive 60-month sentence for the firearm conviction.\n\n       Harris argues that the consecutive 60-month sentence must be vacated because it is\npossible that the district court imposed that punishment pursuant to the unconstitutionally vague\n\u201cresidual clause\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Furthermore, Harris insists that the 60-month\nsentence cannot be saved under the so-called \u201celements clause\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\nbecause neither his conviction for aiding and abetting second-degree murder nor his conviction\nfor aiding and abetting attempted robbery could have been considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\nunder caselaw existing at the time of sentencing.\n\n       Although it is possible that Harris could demonstrate that his sentence is constitutionally\nsuspect, our inquiry does not end there. To justify relief under \u00a7 2255, Harris must identify not\nonly constitutional error but also harm that he suffered from that error. At best, Harris can show\nthat the record of his sentencing is silent as to whether the district court relied upon \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s\nelements clause or residual clause when imposing punishment upon him. Thus, even if the\nrecord\u2019s utter silence is sufficient to show that Harris\u2019s sentence is constitutionally suspect,\nHarris still must establish that he could not have been sentenced to the consecutive 60-month\nprison term under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. Because the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 crime of aiding\nand abetting attempted robbery necessarily constitutes a crime of violence under the elements\nclause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In April 1996, two seventeen-year-olds, Gary Duane Harris and Anthony Charles Gaines,\nJr., approached two soldiers near a convenience store on the United States Army base in Fort\nCampbell, Kentucky. In an attempt to rob the soldiers, Gaines pulled a handgun from his\n\f No. 21-5040                             Harris v. United States                               Page 3\n\n\nclothing. As Gaines attempted to transfer the weapon to his other hand, the gun discharged, and\na bullet struck Private First Class Michael Alonso-Caravia in the neck, killing him.\n\n       Following their arrests, both Harris and Gaines pleaded guilty to charges of aiding and\nabetting second-degree murder, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1111; aiding and abetting\nattempted robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 2111; and aiding and abetting using or\ncarrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\nand 924(c). The district court sentenced Harris to concurrent prison terms of 420 months and 180\nmonths for the second-degree-murder and attempted-robbery convictions and to a consecutive\n60-month prison term for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. We affirmed the convictions and sentence on\ndirect appeal. United States v. Harris (Harris I), 238 F.3d 777 (6th Cir. 2001) (per curiam).\n\n       Harris\u2019s initial collateral attempts to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence proved\nunsuccessful. See Harris v. United States (Harris II), No. 04-5196 (6th Cir. May 4, 2004)\n(order); In re Gary Duane Harris (Harris III), No. 16-5469 (6th Cir. Sept. 23, 2016) (order).\nIn March 2019, however, a panel of this court granted Harris authorization to file a second or\nsuccessive \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the legitimacy of the \u00a7 924(c) conviction and sentence.\nIn re Gary Duane Harris (Harris IV), No. 18-6172 (6th Cir. Mar. 18, 2019) (order). In that\nmotion, Harris argued that his \u00a7 924(c) conviction and sentence cannot withstand constitutional\nscrutiny because, in enhancing his sentence, the district court may have relied upon the residual\nclause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), a clause whose continued vitality at that time had been called\ninto question.\n\n       Indeed, in United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2336 (2019), the Supreme Court\nconcluded that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s residual clause was so vague as to violate principles of due\nprocess. Harris thus asserted that his \u00a7 924(c) sentence must be vacated because it was likely\nthat the district court improperly relied upon the invalidated residual clause to support\nhis enhanced sentence. The district court disagreed, Harris v. United States (Harris V), No.\n5:96-CR-24-TBR, 2020 WL 7769094 (W.D. Ky. Dec. 30, 2020), but did grant Harris a\ncertificate of appealability on the following issues:\n\n       (1) the standard for granting a motion to vacate a sentence based on \u00a7 924(c)\n       where the record is silent but it is possible or likely that the district court relied on\n\f No. 21-5040                              Harris v. United States                             Page 4\n\n\n          the residual clause at sentencing, and (2) whether either of Harris\u2019s predicate\n          offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1111 or 2111 is a categorical crime of violence under\n          the elements clause of \u00a7 924(c).\n\nId., 2020 WL 7769094, at *5.\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\nStandard of Review and Requirements for \u00a7 2255 Relief\n\n          We review de novo the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion. Nagi v. United States, 90 F.3d 130,\n134 (6th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). We also review de novo the legal question of whether an\noffense constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). United States v. Rafidi,\n829 F.3d 437, 443 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing United States v. Denson, 728 F.3d 603, 607 (6th Cir.\n2013)).\n\n          An initial \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cmust allege one of three bases as a threshold standard: (1) an\nerror of constitutional magnitude; (2) a sentence imposed outside the statutory limits; or (3) an\nerror of fact or law that was so fundamental as to render the entire proceeding invalid.\u201d\nWeinberger v. United States, 268 F.3d 346, 351 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing United States v.\nAddonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 185\u201386 (1979)). But when seeking relief pursuant to a second or\nsuccessive \u00a7 2255 motion, the movant faces a more onerous burden and must base the request for\nrelief on either:\n\n          (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence\n          as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that\n          no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or\n          (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review\n          by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).\n\n          Harris cannot point to any newly discovered evidence to support his claim for collateral\nrelief. Rather, he alleges that, in light of the new rule of constitutional law set forth in Davis, the\ndistrict court improperly relied upon the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3) to justify his enhanced\nsentence for aiding and abetting the use or carrying of a firearm.\n\f No. 21-5040                                   Harris v. United States                                     Page 5\n\n\nBasis for Harris\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) Sentence\n\n         By pleading guilty to Count 3 of the superseding indictment returned against him, Harris\nadmitted that he aided and abetted his co-defendant in using or carrying a firearm during and in\nrelation to two crimes\u2014aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting\nattempted robbery. Consequently, he was subject to sentencing pursuant to the provisions of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i)1, which provides:\n\n         [A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence . . . for which\n         the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a\n         firearm . . . shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of\n         violence . . . be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n         The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is explicitly defined in 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 924(c)(3) to mean a felony that:\n\n         (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\n         against the person or property of another, or\n         (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the\n         person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the\n         offense.\n\nSection 924(c)(3)(A) is known as the statute\u2019s \u201celements clause,\u201d while \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is known\nas the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d\n\nChallenges to Statutory Residual Clauses\n\n         In 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591\n(2015), that a sentence imposed pursuant to a \u201cresidual clause\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal\nAct (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)2, could be challenged as a violation of due process.\n\n\n         1\n           Although Harris was convicted of three aiding and abetting offenses, \u201c[w]hoever commits an offense\nagainst the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a\nprincipal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) (emphasis added).\n         2\n           The residual clause of the ACCA defined a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d in part, as \u201cany crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n\f No. 21-5040                            Harris v. United States                            Page 6\n\n\nAccording to the Court, \u201cthe indeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry required by the residual\nclause both denies fair notice to defendants and invites arbitrary enforcement by judges.\u201d\nJohnson, 576 U.S. at 597. Because invalidation of that clause \u201cchanged the substantive reach of\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act,\u201d the Court later recognized that Johnson\u2019s holding must be\napplied retroactively to other cases on collateral review. Welch v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1257,\n1265 (2016). Even so, because of the difference in language between the residual clause of the\nACCA and its definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s residual clause\u2019s definition of\na \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d questions persisted as to whether Johnson\u2019s holding also applied to\nenhanced sentences for using or carrying a firearm during or in relation to such a crime of\nviolence.\n\n       Approximately three years after Johnson, the Supreme Court offered some indication of\nthe ultimate answer to those questions in its ruling in Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S. Ct. 1204\n(2018). In Dimaya, the Court considered a challenge to the constitutionality of a residual clause\ncontained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\u2019s general definition of the term \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Id. at 1210. In\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), Congress, as it did in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), defined a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to be, in\npart, \u201cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that\nphysical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing\nthe offense.\u201d And in Dimaya, as in Johnson, the Court concluded that the residual clause at issue\n\u201cproduces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.\u201d\nDimaya, 138 S. Ct. at 1223 (quoting Johnson, 576 U.S. at 598).\n\n       Finally, in Davis, the Supreme Court addressed head-on the contention that the residual\nclause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) faced the same vagueness problems as did the provisions of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Doing so, the Court, not surprisingly, agreed\n\u201cthat \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague\u201d and cannot serve to define a \u201ccrime of\nviolence\u201d for purposes of conviction and sentencing. Davis, 139 S. Ct. at 2336. Moreover,\ngiven the similarities between the statutory language at issue in Johnson and in Davis, we have\nheld that Davis applies retroactively. In re Franklin, 950 F.3d 909, 911 (6th Cir. 2020) (order)\n(per curiam) (relying upon Welch).\n\f No. 21-5040                             Harris v. United States                           Page 7\n\n\nDetermination of the Basis for the Crime-of-Violence Finding\n\n       In this appeal, Harris relies upon Davis\u2019s invalidation of \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause to\nsupport his claim that his conviction for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a\ncrime of violence, as well as the resulting, consecutive, 60-month sentence, must be vacated.\nAccording to Harris, nothing in the record of his conviction and sentence indicates that the\ndistrict court did not rely upon the unconstitutional residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) in finding\nthat Harris had committed a crime of violence; therefore, he insists that the residual clause\nactually must have been the basis for the district court\u2019s finding.\n\n       To support that contention, Harris cites our decision in Williams v. United States,\n927 F.3d 427 (6th Cir. 2019), and analyzes the five factors that case identified as aids in\ndetermining whether a particular sentence was imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional residual\nclause. After examining the sentencing record, the legal background at the time of sentencing,\nthe presence of informed decisionmakers, the nature of the predicate offense, and later,\npredictable, legal developments, Harris concludes that those factors \u201cestablish that it is possible\nor likely that he was sentenced under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s residual clause,\u201d and that the otherwise\nsilent record \u201cmust be construed in [his] favor.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9, 25.)\n\n       Engaging in an examination of the Williams factors yields little benefit to Harris in this\ncase, however. First, the sentencing record is silent as to the district court\u2019s basis for finding\nHarris worthy of enhanced punishment.\n\n       Second, consideration of the legal background at the time of sentencing does not give a\ndefinitive answer to the relevant question raised by Harris in this collateral challenge. In 1999,\nno binding Sixth Circuit precedent established definitively that either aiding and abetting\nsecond-degree murder or aiding and abetting attempted robbery categorically was a crime of\nviolence.   Furthermore, by that time, the Supreme Court had explained that courts should\ndetermine whether an offense was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d not by examining\nthe circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, but rather by engaging in a\ncategorical-approach analysis. See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990).\n\f No. 21-5040                                    Harris v. United States                                      Page 8\n\n\n          As we explained in our en banc decision in United States v. Burris, 912 F.3d 386, 392\n(6th Cir. 2019):\n\n          The categorical approach prohibits federal sentencing courts from looking at the\n          particular facts of the defendant\u2019s previous state or federal felony convictions;\n          rather, federal sentencing courts \u201cmay \u2018look only to the statutory definitions\u2019\u2014\n          i.e., the elements\u2014of a defendant\u2019s prior offenses.\u201d Descamps [v. United States],\n          570 U.S.[254, 261 (2013)] (quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at 600 . . .). The question\n          for the sentencing court in the elements-clause context is whether every defendant\n          convicted of that state or federal felony must have used, attempted to use, or\n          threatened to use physical force against the person of another in order to have\n          been convicted, not whether the particular defendant actually used, attempted to\n          use, or threatened to use physical force against the person of another in that\n          particular case.\n\n(Citations omitted.) Because the district court did not engage in an explicit categorical-approach\nanalysis at sentencing, Harris contends that the district judge must have relied upon the residual\nclause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) to justify the consecutive, 60-month sentence he imposed. Even at that\ntime, however, it would have been clear to the district court that the federal crime of attempted\nrobbery contained, by definition, the element of force, making it unnecessary to engage in a\ncategorical-approach analysis. Indeed, a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 requires a taking or\nan attempted taking from a person \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation.\u201d3 (Emphasis\nadded.)\n\n          Moreover, by 1993, we had recognized that even the concept of \u201cintimidation\u201d required\nproof of \u201cconduct and words calculated to create the impression that any resistance or defiance\nby the [victim] would be met by force.\u201d United States v. Perry, 991 F.2d 304, 310 (6th Cir.\n1993) (quoting United States v. Jones, 932 F.2d 624, 625 (7th Cir. 1991)); see also United States\nv. Henry, 722 F. App\u2019x 496, 500 (6th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[I]ntimidation is all it takes to satisfy\n\u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u2019s elements clause, which defines crimes involving the \u2018threatened use of physical\nforce\u2019 as crimes of violence.\u201d) (citing United States v. McBride, 826 F.3d 293, 296 (6th Cir.\n2016)). Thus, the legal background in 1999 offers no real support for Harris\u2019s argument; if\nanything, an examination of that legal background indicates that Harris\u2019s conviction for aiding\n\n          3\n           In its entirety, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 provides that \u201c[w]hoever, within the special maritime and territorial\njurisdiction of the United States, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes or attempts to take from the person\nor presence of another anything of value, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years.\u201d\n\f No. 21-5040                             Harris v. United States                            Page 9\n\n\nand abetting attempted robbery fell squarely within the parameters of \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements\nclause, justifying imposition of a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) sentence.\n\n       Third, Harris cannot rely upon information provided by a decisionmaker familiar with the\nbasis for the sentencing decision. Unfortunately, the sentencing judge died in 2013, years before\nHarris first raised his challenge to his sentence based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nDavis. This factor, therefore, \u201ccasts no affirmative light on the question at hand.\u201d Williams,\n927 F.3d at 444.\n\n       Fourth, an examination of the nature of the predicate offenses also does little to aid\nHarris\u2019s cause. In fact, such an analysis lends credence to the belief that the district court relied\nupon \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause in enhancing Harris\u2019s sentence because the predicate offense\nof aiding and abetting attempted robbery requires a finding of a taking or an attempted taking by\nforce and violence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111.\n\n       Fifth, any consideration of legal developments occurring after sentencing sheds little light\non the district court\u2019s actual sentencing rationale. Nevertheless, Sixth Circuit decisions rendered\nafter Harris was sentenced establish that statutory language virtually identical to that found in\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111, the federal prohibition on robbery and attempted robbery, satisfies the\nelements clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 918 F.3d 467,\n484\u201386 (6th Cir. 2019) (finding that carjacking is a crime of violence under the elements clause\nof \u00a7 924(c) because a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 requires the taking of a motor vehicle\n\u201cfrom the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation, or attempts to\ndo so\u201d); McBride, 826 F.3d at 295\u201396 (concluding that bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113,\nwhich requires a taking or an attempt to take certain property \u201cfrom the person or presence of\nanother\u201d \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation,\u201d constitutes a crime of violence under\n\u00a7 4B1.2(a) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines).\n\n       Harris concedes that examination of the Williams factors does not conclusively establish\nthat the sentencing judge relied upon \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause when sentencing him. Indeed, he\nnotes that \u201cthe record [in this matter] is silent on whether the \u00a7 924(c) sentence is based on the\n\f No. 21-5040                            Harris v. United States                             Page 10\n\n\nstatute\u2019s residual clause or its elements clause.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26.) He nevertheless argues\nthat such silence should lead us to conclude that his \u00a7 924(c) sentence is unconstitutional.\n\n       \u201cIt is a \u2018tall order\u2019 for a petitioner to show which . . . clause a district court applied when\nthe sentencing record is silent\u2014a burden all the more unjust considering that silence is the norm,\nnot the exception.\u201d Raines v. United States, 898 F.3d 680, 690\u201391 (6th Cir. 2018) (Cole, C.J.,\nconcurring). But even engaging in a Williams-factors analysis does little to aid Harris. As the\ndistrict court noted when denying Harris relief on his second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201cIn\nthe part of the Williams opinion that Harris relies on, the [Sixth Circuit] was considering whether\nWilliams was entitled to raise a second or successive motion under \u00a7 2255 in the first place, not\nwhether a motion to vacate should prevail.\u201d Harris V, 2020 WL 7769094, at *3 (citing Williams,\n927 F.3d at 439). \u201cAlthough the [Sixth Circuit] found that Williams was entitled to bring a\nsecond \u00a7 2255 motion, it still had to answer the question of whether Williams\u2019s predicate offense\nqualified under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause before deciding if the \u00a7 924(e) sentence should be\nvacated.\u201d Id.; Williams, 927 F.3d at 445 (citing Van Cannon v. United States, 890 F.3d 656, 661\n(7th Cir. 2018) (\u201cTo win \u00a7 2255 relief, Van Cannon had to establish a Johnson error and that the\nerror was harmful. The government confessed the Johnson error . . . . The only remaining\ndispute concerned the question of prejudice.\u201d)). Thus, deciding whether an enhanced sentence\nrelied upon the residual clause or the elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3) does not, by itself, determine\nwhether Harris is entitled to the relief he seeks. Harris also must establish that he suffered\nprejudice from an improper sentencing calculation. Consequently, even despite the possibility\nthat the district court relied upon the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) in sentencing Harris,\nHarris also must show that neither of his predicate offenses qualified for enhanced sentencing\nunder \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. See, e.g., Porter v. United States, 959 F.3d 800, 801\u201302\n(6th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 1060 (2021).\n\nDetermination of Whether Harris\u2019s Predicate Convictions Are Crimes of Violence\n\n       Aiding and Abetting Second-Degree Murder\n\n       Squelching any inclination to presume that a second-degree murder conviction\nnecessarily involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person\n\f No. 21-5040                                   Harris v. United States                                   Page 11\n\n\nof another, the Supreme Court recently held that an offense requiring a mens rea of simple\nrecklessness does not qualify as a violent felony under the elements clause of the ACCA,\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), a clause that is essentially identical to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Borden v.\nUnited States, 141 S. Ct. 1817, 1825 (2021). Consequently, the question presents itself whether\nsecond-degree murder prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 can be committed with mere recklessness\nsuch that it does not necessarily involve the application of force and violence against the person\nof another. We need not resolve that question in this case, however. Because a district court\nmay enhance the prison term under \u00a7 924(c) for the use or carrying of a firearm during and in\nrelation to even one offense that can be considered a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we may affirm the\ndistrict court\u2019s judgment as long as Harris\u2019s conviction for aiding and abetting attempted robbery\ninvolves the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another.\u201d\n\n        Aiding and Abetting Attempted Robbery\n\n        In arguing that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 does not meet that standard, Harris\ncites United States v. Camp, 903 F.3d 594, 601 (6th Cir. 2018), and United States v. Yates,\n866 F.3d 723, 734 (6th Cir. 2017), for the proposition that, pursuant to a categorical-approach\nanalysis, \u201cthe elements of \u00a7 2111 must be compared to the elements of generic robbery which is\ndefined as \u2018the \u201cmisappropriation of property under circumstances involving immediate danger\nto the person.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 40 (quoting Camp, 903 F.3d at 601).) Camp and Yates,\nhowever, were not concerned with whether the crimes at issue in those cases\u2014Hobbs Act\nrobbery (Camp) and Ohio\u2019s robbery statute, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2911.02(A)(3) (Yates)\u2014\nwere crimes of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).4 Rather, the issue in those cases\nrequired an examination of whether the crimes met the generic definition of robbery as listed in\nthe enumeration clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.5\n\n\n        4\n          In fact, in Camp, we recognized that the plain text of the Hobbs Act may be sufficient to categorize\nrobbery as a crime of violence under the use-of-force clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Camp, 903 F.3d at 600.\n        5\n           The provisions of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) of the Guidelines, like the relevant provisions of the ACCA, 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), previously contained three clauses defining the terms \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in the Guidelines or\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d in the ACCA. In addition to the equivalents of an elements clause and a residual clause, \u00a7 4B1.2(a)\nof the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) contained what are known as enumeration clauses that list specific\n\f No. 21-5040                                     Harris v. United States                                      Page 12\n\n\n          Unlike the involved analysis that must be undertaken to determine whether an\nindividual\u2019s prior conviction constitutes an enumerated, generic offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) of\nthe Guidelines or an enumerated, generic offense under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) of the ACCA, an\nanalysis under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) requires only that the predicate offense for which a defendant was\nconvicted necessarily \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against the person or property of another.\u201d See In re Franklin, 950 F.3d at 911 (explaining\nthe relevant inquiry to determine whether arson, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i), constitutes a crime of\nviolence under the elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)).\n\n          Even so, Harris continues to argue that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 cannot be considered a crime of\nviolence because its language \u201cis broader than generic robbery because: 1) under the statute\nintimidation does not have to involve \u2018immediate danger to the person;\u2019 and 2) unlike generic\nrobbery, \u00a7 2111 includes attempted robbery.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 42.) Again, however, under\nthe elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), the government need not establish that every element of a\n\u00a7 2111 violation is included in the definition of generic robbery. Instead, the government need\nshow only that even \u201cthe least of th[e] acts criminalized\u201d by \u00a7 2111 requires the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of force. Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 191 (2013) (alteration in\noriginal) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because \u201cintimidation\u201d \u201cinvolves the\nthreat to use physical force,\u201d McBride, 826 F.3d at 296, and because even attempts to take\nanything of value from a person \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation\u201d constitute \u00a7 2111\nviolations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Fultz, 923 F.3d 1192, 1193, 1195 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 668 (2019)\n(finding that robbery on a government reservation under \u00a7 2111 is a crime of violence for\npurposes of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)); United States v. Shirley, 808 F. App\u2019x 672, 677 (10th Cir. 2020)\n(robbery under \u00a7 2111 meets the requirements of the elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)); United\nStates v. Ben, 783 F. App\u2019x 443, 443 (5th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1547 (2020)\n(same).\n\n\ncrimes that meet the respective definitions of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d See U.S.S.G.\n\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (now listing \u201cmurder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, a forcible sex offense,\nrobbery, arson, extortion, or the use or unlawful possession of a firearm . . . or explosive material . . . .\u201d); 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (listing crimes involving burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives).\n\f No. 21-5040                           Harris v. United States                          Page 13\n\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       Because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 has, as an essential element, \u201cthe use, attempted use, or\nthreatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\u201d it is a crime of\nviolence for purposes of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u2019s elements clause. Harris thus has failed to establish any\nprejudice from the imposition of his \u00a7 924(c) sentence.          Consequently, we AFFIRM the\njudgment of the district court denying Harris\u2019s second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\n\f",
