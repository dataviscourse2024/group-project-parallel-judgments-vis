We affirm.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       Mr. Kobes was granted a four day furlough from the Stevens County Jail to attend\n\nhis grandmother's funeral. His father drove him to Mr. Kobes' wife's house at 1365\n\nKettle Park Road in Kettle Falls in order to obtain his wallet and boots. At that time, a no\n\ncontact order prohibited Mr. Kobes from coming within 100 yards of her \"residence.\"\n\nThat order also provided that law enforcement would provide a \"civil standby\" if Mr.\n\fNo. 34232-8-III\nState v. Kobes\n\n\nKobes needed to recover personal property from the address of 1365 Kettle Park Road.\n\nHowever, Mr. Kobes also knew that Erica Kobes had checked into a Spokane treatment\n\nfacility for a week and was not present. Instead, her mother was in the house watching\n\nthe children during her absence.\n\n       Kobes retrieved his items from the house. When Mrs. Kobes discovered that Mr.\n\nKobes has been there, she reported the incident to law enforcement. The prosecutor\n\nultimately filed a felony charge of residential burglary as well as a gross misdemeanor\n\ncount of violation of a no contact order.\n\n       The defense argued that the Kettle Falls address was not a protected \"residence\"\n\nsince Erica Kobes was \"residing\" in a treatment center in Spokane at the time.\n\nNonetheless, the jury convicted Mr. Kobes on the two counts as charged. He promptly\n\nappealed to this court.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       Mr. Kobes argues that the term \"residence\" used in the no contact order is vague\n\nunder the facts of this case, thus rendering the evidence insufficient to support the\n\nconvictions. We tum to the \"residence\" contention before briefly discussing the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.\n\n       To resolve a contention that a court order is vague, courts will treat the order as if\n\nit were a statute and apply standard rules of statutory construction. State v. Bahl, 164\n\nWash. 2d 739, 753-754, 193 P.3d 678 (2008). The test of vagueness is whether an ordinary\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 34232-8-III\nState v. Kobes\n\n\nperson would understand the meaning of the statute. State v. Halstien, 122 Wash. 2d 109,\n\n117, 857 P.2d 270 (1993). It is the burden of the challenger to establish that the statute is\n\nvague. Id. at 118. When a term is undefined, courts can tum to a dictionary to provide\n\nthe plain and ordinary meaning of the language in question. Bahl, 164 Wash. 2d at 754. In\n\naddressing an \"as applied\" challenge, such as that raised here, the question is whether\n\n\"the statute as applied to the particular facts of the case and the party's conduct\" is so\n\nindefinite as to fail to \"provide ascertainable standards of guilt to protect against arbitrary\n\nenforcement.\" State v, Peterson, 174 Wash. App. 828, 845, 301 P.3d 1060 (2013).\n\n       We do not believe an ordinary person would believe that someone leaving her\n\nhome for a week, leaving her children there with her mother as babysitter, and leaving\n\nher possessions behind, would think that the residence has been abandoned. Temporary\n\ndomicile for a brief, fixed period has never been commonly understood as a ch(lnge of\n\nresidence.\n\n       Appellant notes that the term \"residence\" has been defined in varying different\n\nways depending on the statutory context, and relies on the definition used in a sex\n\noffender registration case, State v. Jenkins, 100 Wash. App. 85, 995 P.2d 1268 (2000).\n\nJenkins adopted the following definition found in an earlier case, State v. Pickett, 95 Wn.\n\nApp. 475,478, 975 P.2d 584 (1999):\n\n       \"Residence as the term is commonly understood is the place where a person\n       lives as either a temporary or permanent dwelling, a place to which one\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fNo. 34232-8-III\nState v. Kobes\n\n\n       intends to return, as distinguished from a place of temporary sojourn or\n       transient visit.\"\n\nJenkins, 100 Wash. App. at 91 (quoting Pickett, 95 Wash. App. at 478). We agree that this is\n\nan appropriate definition to apply here. But we disagree that this definition helps Mr.\n\nKobes. 1\n\n       His argument essentially relies on the first half of the definition by emphasizing\n\nthat a temporary dwelling can be a permanent residence. However, the second half is\n\ncritical to understanding the whole definition. In addition to being a temporary dwelling,\n\nthe location must be a place to which the person intends to return and distinguishable\n\nfrom \"' a place of temporary sojourn or transient visit.' \" 2 Id.\n\n       Here, Mr. Kobes knew that his wife intended to return to her home. The children\n\ncontinued to reside in the house and their personal property (such as his wallet) was\n\nmaintained there. She had arranged for a live-in caregiver during her absence. In short,\n\nhe knew that her absence was temporary and that she intended to return to the family\n\nhome. In contrast, there is no evidence supporting a belief that Ms. Ko bes intended to\n\n\n\n       1\n          In Jenkins, the key issue was defining the words \"residence address.\" The word\n\"residence\" served as an adjective describing the key word, \"address.\" Here, the word\n\"residence\" is a noun carrying a somewhat different meaning than the adjective at issue\nin Jenkins.\n        2 Washington law generally recognizes that residence, once established, is\n\npresumed to continue until the person claiming a change in residence establishes that fact.\nE.g., State v. Burns, 59 Wn.2d 197,200,367 P.2d 119 (1961); Fiske v. Fiske, 48 Wash. 2d\n69, 72,290 P.2d 725 (1955).\n\n                                               4\n\fNo. 34232-8-III\nState v. Kobes\n\n\nreturn to the Spokane facility after her week of treatment was complete. It may have\n\nbeen a temporary dwelling, but it was not a temporary residence.\n\n       Accordingly, a person of reasonable intelligence would not believe that Ms. Ko bes\n\nno longer maintained the Kettle Falls address as her residence. The word \"residence\"\n\nwas not vague under the facts of this case.\n\n       That determination simplifies the remaining issue. A person commits the crime of\n\nresidential burglary when he enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling with the intent to\n\ncommit a crime therein. RCW 9A.52.025(1). Entry is unlawful when made in violation\n\nof a court order, even when the violator acts with the permission of the protected person.\n\nState v. Sanchez, 166 Wash. App. 304, 307-312, 271 P.3d 264 (2012).\n\n       Appellate courts review sufficiency of the evidence challenges to see if there was\n\nevidence from which the trier of fact could find each element of the offense proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Green, 94 Wash. 2d 216, 221-222, 616 P.2d 628 (1980)\n\n(citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)).\n\nThe reviewing court will consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution. Id. It also must defer to the finder of fact in resolving conflicting evidence\n\nand credibility determinations. State v. Camarillo, 115 Wash. 2d 60, 71, 794 P.2d 850\n\n(1990).\n\n       The only contested element in this appeal is the \"unlawful entry\" aspect of the\n\ncnme. That argument is predicated on both the theory that the house was no longer Erica\n\n                                              5\n\fNo. 34232-8-111\nState v. Kobes\n\n\nKobes' residence while she was in Spokane for the week and that her mother allowed Mr.\n\nKo bes into the house. The \"residence\" discussion earlier is dispositive of these\n\narguments. The no contact order excluded Mr. Kobes from the Kettle Falls house\n\nbecause it was Erica Kobes' residence. Neither Erica Kobes nor her mother could grant\n\nMr. Kobes permission to enter the house. Sanchez, 166 Wash. App. at 310. Only a court\n\ncould alter that order. Id. at 310-311.\n\n       Accordingly, the evidence supported the unlawful entry element of the crime. The\n\nevidence therefore supported the jury verdict and was sufficient.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW\n\n2.06.040.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                                    j\n\n\n                                             6\n\f",
