Appeal was duly perfected in this case on October 21, 2014. The\n\nJudgment appealed from awarded over $50,000,000 in actual and exemplary damages\n\nat the conclusion of a three-and-a-half day bench trial on over 20 causes of action,\n\nfrom breach of contract to fraud to the Texas Theft Act.\n\f         2. There were no findings of fact or conclusions of law on the amount of\n\nany damages awarded on any claim, however, despite Appellants\u2019 request for\n\nadditional findings and conclusions. The Judgment awarded these damages simply\n\nas aggregate, gross amounts, for Shah in the gross amount of $9,336,920,00, and for\n\nApex Katy Physicians, LLC, in the gross amount of $4,071,584.00.\n\n         3. Additionally, this case is extremely complicated and involves numerous\n\nclaims, defenses, findings, and conclusions, all of which are hotly contested.\n\nAppellants have been forced to cover every single issue in possible way in order to\n\nattack the nonspecific and aggregate findings.\n\n         3. Appellants have tried very hard to this very day to produce a proper brief\n\nthat contains only 15,000 words, but still asserts their well founded positions, but this\n\nhas been frankly impossible. Consequently, Appellants request leave to file a brief\n\nthat does not exceed 20,000 words in the interest of justice.\n\n         4. Mr. Gaston, Appellee\u2019s lead counsel on this appeal, has today advised\n\nthat Appellee\u2019s are not opposed to this request.\n\n         WHEREFORE, Appellants Adeel Zaidi, A. K. Chagla, Prestige Consulting,\n\nInc., and Apex Katy Physicians, \u2013 TMG, LLC, and Appellees Pankaj K.
