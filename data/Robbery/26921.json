After careful review, we affirm.\n\n      On December 14, 2012, a jury convicted appellant of the following\n\noffenses: one count of second-degree murder, four counts of robbery\u2014threat\n\nof immediate serious injury, three counts of aggravated assault, and one count\n\neach of conspiracy to commit robbery, firearms not to be carried without a\n\nlicense, carrying firearms in public in Philadelphia, and possession of an\n\ninstrument of crime.1 On June 21, 2013, the trial court sentenced appellant\n\n\n118 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(b), 3701(a)(1)(ii), 2702(a), 903(a)(1), 6106(a)(1),\n6108, and 907(a), respectively.\n\fJ. S70014/18\n\nto an aggregate sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\nA previous panel of this court affirmed appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence on\n\nDecember 19, 2014.      See Commonwealth v. Ransome, 116 A.3d 693\n\n(Pa.Super. 2014) (unpublished memorandum).           On June 29, 2015, our\n\nsupreme court denied appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.         See\n\nCommonwealth v. Ransome, 117 A.3d 1281 (Pa. 2015).\n\n      Appellant filed a timely pro se PCRA petition on March 22, 2016. On\n\nApril 28, 2016, he filed an amended pro se PCRA petition. Therein, appellant\n\naverred that his sentence was illegal in light of Alleyne v. United States,\n\n570 U.S. 99 (2013), and that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance\n\nfor failing to raise a double jeopardy claim. (See amended PCRA petition,\n\n4/28/16; Docket No. 28.) The PCRA court appointed David Rudenstein, Esq.,\n\nto represent appellant; and on June 5, 2017, Attorney Rudenstein filed a\n\nno-merit letter pursuant to Commonwealth v. Turner, 544 A.2d 927 (Pa.\n\n1988), and Commonwealth v. Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa.Super. 1988)\n\n(en banc), along with a petition to withdraw.\n\n      On June 6, 2017, the PCRA court filed a notice of intent to dismiss\n\nappellant\u2019s PCRA petition without a hearing pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. In\n\nits Rule 1925(a) opinion, the PCRA court notes that after receiving a letter\n\nfrom appellant in which appellant indicated that he did not receive a\n\nTurner/Finley no-merit letter, the PCRA court continued its dismissal of\n\nappellant\u2019s petition until July 17, 2017. (PCRA court opinion, 1/16/18 at 5.)\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ. S70014/18\n\nThe   PCRA court       further   notes    that on   July 17, 2017, it required\n\nAttorney Rudenstein to re-send his Turner/Finley no-merit letter to\n\nappellant, and that on September 4, 2017, Attorney Rudenstein informed the\n\nPCRA court that \u201che sent a Finley letter back in July and just to be sure, he\n\n\u2018recently sent another copy\u2019 to [a]ppellant.\u201d (Id.) The PCRA court dismissed\n\nappellant\u2019s petition on September 6, 2017. On January 22, 2018, the PCRA\n\ncourt granted Attorney Rudenstein\u2019s petition to withdraw.\n\n      Appellant filed a timely pro se notice of appeal on September 26, 2017.\n\nThe PCRA court ordered appellant to file a concise statement of errors\n\ncomplained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) and appellant\n\ncomplied.     The PCRA court subsequently filed an opinion pursuant to\n\nPa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n      In his brief, appellant initially raised the following issues for our review:\n\n             I.     Whether the PCRA Court erred by failing to\n                    provide [a]ppellant additional time to respond\n                    to PCRA Counsel\u2019s Finley letter and 907 Notice\n                    prior to the dismissal of the PCRA in violation of\n                    the Due Process Clause?\n\n             II.    Whether PCRA Counsel rendered ineffective[]\n                    assistance of counsel?\n\nAppellant\u2019s brief at iii.\n\n      We remanded this case on November 20, 2018, for the PCRA court to\n\ndetermine whether appellant received a copy of Attorney Rudenstein\u2019s\n\nTurner/Finley       no-merit     letter   and   petition   to   withdraw.     See\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fJ. S70014/18\n\nCommonwealth v. Ransome, 201 A.3d 861 (Pa.Super. 2018) (unpublished\n\nmemorandum).      On February 22, 2019, we entered an order granting the\n\nPCRA court an additional 60 days to comply with our November 20, 2018\n\ndirective to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Five days later, on February 27,\n\n2019, appellant filed a pro se application for relief in which he requested an\n\nextension of time to file an appeal. Appellant also requested the release of\n\n\u201cpertinent parts of the record to develop and articulate most of his claims.\u201d\n\n(See application for relief, 2/27/19.)\n\n      On July 25, 2019, the PCRA court determined that appellant had not\n\nreceived a copy of Attorney Rudenstein\u2019s Turner/Finley no-merit letter prior\n\nto June 14, 2019, at which point appellant was personally served with a copy\n\nof both the no-merit letter and the PCRA court\u2019s notice of intent to dismiss\n\nappellant\u2019s PCRA petition without a hearing pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907.\n\n(PCRA court findings of fact, 7/25/19 at 1.) As directed by our remand order,\n\nthe PCRA court gave appellant 30 days to respond to the Turner/Finley letter\n\nand the Rule 907 notice.      In response, appellant filed a pro se document\n\nentitled \u201cAequitas Jurisdictiones Non Confundit (equity does not confuse\n\njurisdiction),\u201d on July 11, 2019. The document did not in any way address\n\nthe issues raised in Attorney Rudenstein\u2019s no-merit letter, nor did it raise any\n\nineffective assistance of PCRA counsel challenge. (See PCRA court findings of\n\nfact, 7/25/19, Appendix A.)\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ. S70014/18\n\n      Based on our review of the record, we find that appellant\u2019s issues\n\nrelating to sentencing and ineffective assistance of counsel that he raised in\n\nhis   pro   se   amended     PCRA   petition   were   thoroughly   addressed   in\n\nAttorney Rudenstein\u2019s Turner/Finley no-merit letter.        Having determined,\n\nafter careful review, that the Honorable Diana L. Anhalt, in her Rule 1925(a)\n\nopinion, ably and comprehensively disposes of appellant\u2019s issues on appeal,\n\nwith appropriate reference to the record and without legal error, we affirm on\n\nthe basis of that opinion.\n\n      Order affirmed.\n\n      Appellant\u2019s application for relief filed February 27, 2019 is denied.\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

The Court submits the following\n\nOpinion in accordance with the requirements of Pa.R.A.P. l 925(a). For the reasons set forth\n\nherein, the Court holds that Appellant's PCRA Petition was properly dismissed.\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       On February 7, 2007, police arrested and charged Appellant, Isaiah Ransome with\n\nnumerous offenses stemming from a shooting and robbery. On December 14, 2012, ajury\n\nconvicted Appellant of second-degree murder and related offenses. On June 21, 2013, the\n\nHonorable Benjamin Lerner sentenced Appellant to life imprisonment without the possibility of\n\nparole. On June 26, 2013, Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. On July 1, 2013, the court\n\nordered Appellant pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. l 925(b) to file with the court a Concise Statement of\n\nMatters Complained of on Appeal. On July 22, 2013, Appellant filed a motion for extension of\n\ntime which the court granted. On November 7, 2013, Appellant filed his 1925(b) Statement with\n\nthe Court. On March 10, 2014, Judge Lerner issued his opinion. On December 19, 2014, the\n\fSuperior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court denied\n\nAppellant's Petition for Allowance of Appeal.\n\n       On March 22, 2016, Appellant filed another PCRA petition. On April 28, 2016,\n\nAppellant filed yet another PCRA Petition. After appointment of counsel, on June 5, 2017,\n\ncounsel filed a Finley Letter. On June 6, 2017, this Court submitted an intent to dismiss notice\n\nunder Rule 907. On September 6, 2017, this Court formally dismissed Appellant's PCRA\n\npetition for lack of merit. On September 26, 2017, Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. On\n\nOctober 6, 2017, this Court ordered Appellant pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b) to file with the\n\nCourt a Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal. On November 9, 2017,\n\nAppellant filed a Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal. Appellant raises the following\n\nissues on appeal:\n\n   a. Whether the PCRA court erred by failing to require PCRA counsel to give Appellant a\n\n       copy of the Finley Letter and allow additional time for Appellant to respond to the Finley\n\n       Letter prior to the dismissal of the PCRA in violation of Appellant's right to due process.\n\n   b. Whether PCRA counsel was ineffective for failing to raise or investigate the issue of\n\n       Appellant being misidentified in cell phone video by prosecution at trial and trial\n\n       counsel's ineffectiveness thereto for his failure to object or raise the issue on appeal.\n\n   c. Whether PCRA counsel was ineffective for refusing to respond to Appellant's letters\n\n       requesting him to have new witnesses interviewed.\n\n   d. Whether PCRA counsel was ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel's ineffectiveness\n\n       for failing to address the trial court's abuse of discretion in allowing statements taken\n\n       from juveniles without a parent or guardian present in the record.\n\n   e. Whether PCRA counsel was ineffective for filing an inadequate Finley Letter.\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f    f.   Whether the PCRA court erred in allowing PCRA counsel to file an inadequate Finley\n\n         Letter, which did not address every issue Appellant requested PCRA counsel to raise,\n\n         after conducting its independent review.\n\nFACTUAL HISTORY1\n         On October 3, 2006, at approximately 9:20 p.m., Gary Roemhild, Kevin Roemhild, Keith\n\nPena and the decedent, Michael Thierry, were standing on the front steps of 1500 Rosalie Street,\n\nwhere Gary rented an apartment. As the complainants were conversing with each other,\n\nAppellant and his cohorts, all of whom were armed, approached them. (N.T., 12/6/12, pp. 23-27,\n\n111-117; 12/7/12, pp. 20-25).\n\n         Sensing that a robbery was about to occur, Gary attempted to run inside. He could not\n\nopen the door before Appellant, who was holding a handgun, grabbed him and demanded that he\n\nempty his pockets. (N.T., 12/6/12, pp. 27-28, 117-119). Keith Pena was standing on the steps\n\nnext to Gary. He was robbed by Appellant's brother, Jerry Ransome, who brandished a .32\n\ncaliber revolver. (N.T., 12/7/12, pp. 25-27). Kevin Roemhild and Michael Thierry were at the\n\nbottom of the steps, near the pavement. Eric Gales pointed a .22 caliber rifle at Kevin\n\nRoemhild's head during the robbery. Sean Gordine confronted Michael Thierry. (N.T., 12/6/12,\n\npp. 27-28, 121-131).\n\n         Gary, Keith and Kevin each gave up their money, wallets and cell phones. Michael\n\nThierry dropped his keys and cell phone to the ground and ran. At that point, all four defendants\n\nturned toward Thierry and started shooting. Thierry was shot in the head and groin and collapsed\n\nnear the intersection of Rosalie and Horrocks Streets. As they fled, the defendants turned their\n\nweapons on the surviving victims and fired multiple gunshots at them.\n\n\n1\n The following factual history was taken from the Honorable Benjamin Lerner's Opinion dated\nMarch 10, 2014.\n\n                                                    3\n\f       Police arrived on the scene within a few minutes. There they found Thierry lying in the\n\nstreet. Thierry was taken to the hospital, where he died three days later.\n\n       Over the next several months, homicide detectives interviewed the victims and spoke\n\nwith several witnesses. One of those witnesses was Appellant's brother, Jamil Ransome. He told\n\npolice that Appellant owned a .357 magnum and that Appellant kept the gun at his girlfriend's\n\nhouse. On February 5, 2007, police executed a search warrant at the home of Appellant's\n\ngirlfriend and recovered a .357 magnum.\n\n       On February 7, 2007, Appellant was arrested. He did not give a statement to police.\n\nHowever, in a separate investigation that occurred four months before this incident, Appellant\n\ntold police that he had owned a .357 magnum but he had gotten rid of the gun. Appellant also\n\nacknowledged during the prior investigation that ammunition discovered in his bedroom was his\n\nproperty.\n\n       At trial, two surviving victims, Gary and Kevin Roemhild, and multiple bystanders who\n\nobserved the robbery and subsequent shooting positively identified Appellant as one of the\n\nshooters. The Commonwealth also presented testimony from several police officers and the\n\nmedical examiner, ballistics evidence linking the defendants to the crime, inculpatory statements\n\nAppellant made to Jamil Ransome and Deante Smith after the shooting, and a cell phone video\n\ndepicting all four defendants playing Russian roulette with a .32 caliber handgun. Appellant did\n\nnot have a license to carry a firearm.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n       a. This Court did require counsel to send the Finley letter and did provide more\n          time for Appellant to respond.\n\n       Appellant argues that this Court erred by failing to require PCRA counsel to send him a\n\ncopy of the Finley Letter. Appellant also claims that this Court did not allow for additional time\n\n\n                                                  4\n\ffor him to respond to the Finley Letter prior to the dismissal of his PCRA. However, this Court\n\ndid require counsel to send Appellant the Finley letter and did provide Appellant more time to\n\nrespond.\n\n       On June 5, 2017, Appellant's counsel filed his Finley letter with this Court. On June 6,\n\n2017, this Court filed and mailed a notice of its intent to dismiss under rule 907 to whom this\n\nCourt notified Appellant that this Court would formally dismiss his PCRA on July 7, 2017 and\n\nprovided him 20 days to respond. Following Appellant's letter indicating that he was not in\n\nreceipt of the Finley letter, this Court continued its dismissal to July 17, 2017. On that date, this\n\nCourt required counsel to resend Appellant the Finley letter and continued its dismissal until\n\nSeptember 6, 2017. On September 4, 2017, this Court received a letter from counsel notifying\n\nthe Court that he sent a Finley letter back in July and just to be sure, he \"recently sent another\n\ncopy\" to Appellant. (See attached letter). This Court formally dismissed Appellant's PCRA on\n\nSeptember 6, 2017. Therefore, this Court did not err.\n\n       b. Appellant's arguments b through e are not reviewable.\n\n       In issues b through e, Appellant provides numerous arguments in connection with his\n\nPCRA counsel's effectiveness. However, those contentions are considered waived, as new\n\nclaims may not be raised on appeal. If there was any confusion as to whether a defendant could\n\nchallenge the effectiveness of PCRA counsel on appeal from denial of PCRA relief, the court in\n\nCommonwealth v. Pitts, 981 A.2d 875, 880, n.4 (Pa. 2009) cleared it up, holding that claims of\n\nPCRA ineffectiveness could not be raised for the first time on direct or discretionary appeal.\n\nTherefore, Appellant's arguments regarding the effectiveness of PCRA counsel are all\n\nconsidered waived and not reviewable for purposes of this appeal. See also, Commonwealth v.\n\nLigons, 971 A.2d I 125 (Pa. 2009); Commonwealth v. Hall, 872 A.2d 1177 (Pa. 2005).\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f       f. This Court did not err in allowing PCRA counsel to file an inadequate Finley\n          Letter, as it was not inadequate.\n\n       Appellant argues that this Court erred in allowing PCRA counsel to file an inadequate\n\nFinley Letter. Specifically, Appellant claims that PCRA counsel did not address every issue\n\nAppellant requested. However, because PCRA counsel addressed both claims presented in his\n\nprose PCRA Petition, Appellant's argument is baseless.\n\n       Here, Appellant raised two issues in his pro se PCRA Petition. (1) Montgomery v.\n\nLouisiana/Alleyne and (2) that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a double jeopardy\n\nclaim. See pro se PCRA Petition at 1, 23. Counsel's Finley letter noted and subsequently\n\nanalyzed both issues. (See Finley letter at 7-11). This Court properly accepted and agreed with\n\nPCRA counsel's analysis of both issues, as they are both without merit. See Commonwealth v.\n\nTurner, 544 A.2d 927, 928 (Pa. 1988). Therefore, this Court did not err.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n       After review of the applicable statutes, testimony, and case law this Court's decision\n\nshould be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    BY THE COURT:\n\n\n\n\nDATE: January 16, 2018                                              DIANA L.
