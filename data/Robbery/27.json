We affirm Hutchin\u2019s convictions; however, we reverse as to the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences for counts I, II, and III (armed burglary, armed robbery, and attempted armed robbery), since the offenses arose from the same criminal episode. See Hale v. State, 630 So.2d 521 (Fla.1993).\nAffirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded for resentencing.\nSCHOONOVER, A.C.J., and LAZZARA, J., concur.\n",
