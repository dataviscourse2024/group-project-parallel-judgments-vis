Mario Solorzano-Patlan\nchallenges the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019\n(BIA) decision that he was removable from the\nUnited States as an \"aggravated felon\" because\nhis Illinois burglary conviction was classified\nas a \"burglary offense,\" as well as a \"crime of\nviolence,\" for which the term of imprisonment is\nat least one year. See 8 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n1101(a)(43)(F) & (G). Because we conclude that\nthe BIA\u2019s interpretation of sections\n1101(a)(43)(F) and (G) was erroneous, we GRANT the\npetition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s deportation\norder, and REMAND this case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n  On March 16, 1995, Solorzano-Patlan, a lawful\npermanent resident of the United States with no\nprior criminal record,/1 pled guilty to an\ninformation in Lake County, Illinois, charging\nthat \"without authority, [he] knowingly entered\na 1994 Ford Explorer belonging to [another] with\nthe intent to commit therein a theft.\"/2\n(emphasis added). That same day, Solorzano-Patlan\nwas sentenced to sixty days\u2019 imprisonment and\ntwenty-four months of supervised probation./3\n\n  On March 31, 1998, the Illinois court revoked\n\fSolorzano-Patlan\u2019s probation because he failed to\ncomplete his community service or pay his fines,\nand sentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment;\nat the same time, recommending that Solorzano-\nPatlan be enrolled in the Illinois \"impact\nincarceration\" program, commonly referred to as\n\"boot camp.\" This recommendation was denied\nbecause the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (INS) had placed a detainer on Solorzano-\nPatlan making him ineligible for the \"impact\nincarceration\" program, and he was incarcerated\nat the Shawnee Correctional Center./4\n\n  While he was serving his three-year sentence,\nthe INS issued Solorzano-Patlan a Notice to\nAppear, thereby initiating removal proceedings\nagainst him. See 8 U.S.C. sec. 1229. The Notice\nto Appear charged that Solorzano-Patlan was\nsubject to removal from the United States based\non the INS\u2019s determination that his 1995 Illinois\nburglary conviction was classified as an\naggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\"Any alien who is convicted\nof an aggravated felony at any time after\nadmission is deportable.\").\n\n  On December 16, 1998, the Immigration Judge\n(IJ) conducted removal proceedings to determine\nthe question of Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s deportability.\nSolorzano-Patlan appeared before the IJ and\nadmitted only the factual allegations contained\nin the Notice to Appear, but argued that his\nburglary conviction did not rise to the level of\nan \"aggravated felony,\" and should not be\nclassified as such, because it was neither a\n\"burglary offense\" under 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1101(a)(43)(G) nor a \"crime of violence\" under 8\nU.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(F).\n\n  The IJ rejected Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s arguments,\nand concluded, without analyzing the specific\ncharacteristics of Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s offense,\nthat his 1995 Illinois burglary conviction, by\nthe very title of the offense, satisfied the\n\"burglary offense\" definition of aggravated\nfelony. Also, the IJ only looked to the \"generic\nelements of the offense\" and found that\nSolorzano-Patlan\u2019s conviction satisfied the\n\"crime of violence\" definition of aggravated\nfelony because, according to the IJ, \"burglary of\nan auto ordinarily presents risk that physical\nforce would be used against property.\" Thus,\nfinding that Solorzano-Patlan had committed an\naggravated felony, the IJ terminated Solorzano-\nPatlan\u2019s status as a legal permanent resident and\nordered him deported to Mexico.\n\n  Solorzano-Patlan appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to\nthe BIA. On August 31, 1999, the BIA affirmed the\nIJ\u2019s decision, and concluded that Solorzano-\n\fPatlan\u2019s violation of the Illinois burglary\nstatute \"falls easily within the definition of a\n\u2019burglary offense.\u2019\" The BIA further concluded\nthat Solorzano-Patlan committed a \"crime of\nviolence\" because, according to the BIA (which\nrelied on Fifth Circuit caselaw), \"[t]he burglary\nof a vehicle involves a substantial risk that\nphysical force may be used against persons or\nproperty.\"/5 The BIA went on to hold that the IJ\ncorrectly decided that Solorzano-Patlan was an\naggravated felon, and dismissed Solorzano-\nPatlan\u2019s appeal. Solorzano-Patlan petitions for\nreview.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n  Under The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\n\"[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated\nfelony at any time after admission is\ndeportable.\" 8 U.S.C. sec. 1227 (a)(2)(A)(iii).\nAdditionally, the transitional rules set forth in\nthe 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act, section 309(c)(4), state that\nappeals of final orders of deportation entered\nafter October 30, 1996, shall not be permitted\n\"in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or\ndeportable by reason of having committed . . .\n[an aggravated felony].\" Because we have the\nauthority to determine jurisdiction, we may\nreview whether Solorzano-Patlan has committed an\naggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). See Xiong v. INS, 173 F.3d\n601, 604 (7th Cir. 1999). Consequently, both our\njurisdiction to hear this case and the merits of\nthe appeal turn on the question of whether\nSolorzano-Patlan is an aggravated felon, a\ndecision we review de novo. Id. at 604-05.\n\n  In this case, it is uncontested that Solorzano-\nPatlan is an alien convicted under an Illinois\nstatute entitled burglary. Thus, the question is\nwhether Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s conduct which resulted\nin a conviction pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stats.\n5/19-1(a) is an \"aggravated felony\" as that term\nis defined in 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)./6 The INS argues that\nSolorzano-Patlan\u2019s burglary conviction satisfies\nthe definitions of two \"aggravated felony\"\noffenses: \"burglary offense\" in 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1101(a)(43)(G) and \"crime of violence\" in 8\nU.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(F).\n\nA. The Definition of \"Burglary Offense\" in 8\nU.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(G)\n\n  The INA defines \"aggravated felony\" as including\na \"burglary offense for which the term of\nimprisonment [is] at least one year.\" 8 U.S.C.\nsec. 1101(a)(43)(G). It is important to note that\nCongress did not define the term \"burglary\n\foffense\" in the INA and that individual states\nuse different and various definitions to describe\nwhat conduct does and does not constitute the\ncrime of burglary in their respective\njurisdictions./7 Notwithstanding this, the INS\nargues that \"[w]here petitioner was convicted of\nthe crime of burglary, his offense falls squarely\nunder the statute. No additional analysis should\nbe required.\" This is to say that, according to\nthe INS, Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s Illinois conviction\nis a \"burglary offense,\" and thus an aggravated\nfelony, simply because he was convicted under an\nIllinois statute entitled \"burglary.\" Because the\nSupreme Court has disapproved of this categorical\napproach in similar cases, see Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), we reject the INS\u2019s\nreading of 8 U.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(G); although\nSolorzano-Patlan\u2019s offense is classified as a\n\"burglary\" under Illinois law, it does not\nnecessarily follow that his offense is a per se\n\"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)./8\n\n  In Taylor, the Supreme Court stated, although\nin the context of a section 924(e) enhancement,\nthat\n\n[i]t seems to us to be implausible that Congress\nintended the meaning of \"burglary\" . . . to\ndepend on the definition adopted by the State of\nconviction. That would mean that a person\nconvicted of unlawful possession of a firearm\nwould, or would not, receive a sentence\nenhancement based on exactly the same conduct,\ndepending on whether the State of his prior\nconviction happened to call that conduct\n\"burglary.\"\n\n  For example, Michigan has no offense formally\nlabeled \"burglary.\" It classifies burglaries into\nseveral grades of \"breaking and entering.\" See\nMich. Comp. Laws sec. 750.110 (1979). In\ncontrast, California defines \"burglary\" so\nbroadly as to include shoplifting and theft of\ngoods from a \"locked\" but unoccupied automobile.\nSee Cal. Penal Code Ann. sec. 459 (West Supp.\n1990) . . . .\n\n* * *\n\nWithout a clear indication that . . . Congress\nintended to abandon its general approach of using\nuniform categorical definitions to identify\npredicate offenses, we do not interpret Congress\u2019\nomission of a definition of \"burglary\" in a way\nthat leads to odd results of this kind.\n\n495 U.S. at 590-91 (emphasis added).\n\n  As stated previously, Solorzano-Patlan pled\n\fguilty in Illinois to burglary, pursuant to 720\nIll. Comp. Stats. 5/19-1(a), after he was charged\nwith \"knowingly enter[ing] a 1994 Ford Explorer\nbelonging to [another without authority] with the\nintent to commit therein a theft.\" (emphasis\nadded). This Illinois conviction, classified as\na burglary, prompted the INS to initiate\ndeportation proceedings against Solorzano-Patlan\nand argue that he was deportable because he was\nconvicted of a burglary offense and was,\ntherefore, an aggravated felon.\n\n  But we can see that the INS\u2019s argument is\nflawed when examining the charging papers in this\ncase. In this case, Solorzano-Patlan admitted\nonly to the facts contained in the burglary\ncharge before the IJ and specifically contested\nthe INS\u2019s claim that he was an aggravated felon\nbased on those facts. Moreover, the charging\npapers state that he entered the vehicle with the\nintent to commit a theft, not with the intent to\ncommit a felony, as the statute gave the\ngovernment the option to charge./9\n\n  By merely reviewing the statutes in the states\ncomprising the Seventh Circuit, not to mention\nthe other states across the country, it is easy\nto understand why the Supreme Court has refused\nto allow federal statutory interpretation to be\nbased on the various definitions of criminal\nactivity in the state of conviction. If\nSolorzano-Patlan had been convicted in Indiana,\nit is most likely he would have been charged\nunder Indiana Code sec. 35-43-4-2(a) (1999)\n(emphasis added), which is entitled \"Theft\" and\nreads: \"A person who knowingly or intentionally\nexerts unauthorized control over property of\nanother person, with intent to deprive the other\nperson of any part of its value or use, commits\ntheft . . . .\" Therefore, if Solorzano-Patlan had\nbeen convicted in Indiana, the INS would\npresumably not have espoused the position that\nSolorzano-Patlan\u2019s conduct fell under the\n\"burglary offense\" definition of an aggravated\nfelony because Solorzano-Patlan would not have\nbeen convicted of burglary, but rather theft.\n\n  If we examine Wisconsin criminal law under the\nsame factual situation, it is even more\nunderstandable why Congress did not intend to\nrely solely on the respective jurisdictions\u2019\ndefinitions of criminal conduct. If Solorzano-\nPatlan had committed his offense in Wisconsin, he\nwould have been charged under Wisconsin Statute\nsec. 943.11, which is entitled \"Entry Into a\nLocked Vehicle\" and reads: \"Whoever intentionally\nenters the locked and enclosed portion or\ncompartment of the vehicle of another without\nconsent and with the intent to steal therefrom is\nguilty of a Class A misdemeanor.\" Furthermore, a\n\fClass A misdemeanor is only punishable by \"a fine\nnot to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to\nexceed 9 months, or both.\" Wis. Stat. sec.\n939.51(3)(a) (1999). Therefore, in Wisconsin,\nSolorzano-Patlan would only have been charged\nwith a misdemeanor, and therefore he would not\nhave been eligible for deportation.\n\n  Because states define criminal conduct in a\nvariety of ways, the Supreme Court held that the\nterm \"burglary\" must be read in its \"generic\nsense\" as \"having the basic elements of unlawful\nentry into, or remaining in, a building or\nstructure, with intent to commit a crime.\" Id. at\n598-99 (emphasis added); cf. Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 194, 1424 (6th ed. 1990) (defining a\n\"building\" as a \"[s]tructure designed for\nhabitation, shelter, storage, trade, manufacture,\nreligion, business, and the like,\" and a\n\"structure\" is defined as \"an edifice or building\nof any kind\").\n\n  The need for a uniform interpretation of\n\"burglary\" in 8 U.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(G) is as\ngreat as the need for a uniform interpretation of\n\"burglary\" in 18 U.S.C. sec. 924(e)(2) (B)(ii).\nSee Iris Bennett, The Unconstitutionality of\nNonuniform Immigration Consequences of\n\"Aggravated Felony\" Convictions, 74 N.Y.U. L.\nRev. 1696 (1999). Thus, we conclude that\n\"burglary offense\" in 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1101(a)(43)(G) means \"burglary\" in its \"generic\nsense\" and, therefore, according to Taylor, must\nhave the basic elements of unlawful entry into,\nor remaining in, a building or structure, with\nintent to commit a crime. Cf. United States v.\nGuerrero-Cruz, No. 98-50685, 1999 WL 1128658 (9th\nCir. Dec. 7, 1999) (finding the California\nstatutory definition of \"burglary\" too broad and\nemploying the Taylor definition in interpreting\n8 U.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(G)). Therefore, the INS\ninterpreted burglary in too broad a manner and,\nin the future, it would be well advised to look\nat the charging papers in order to ensure that\nthese basic elements are satisfied before it\ninitiates the serious ramifications of removal\nproceedings based on an alleged \"burglary\noffense.\"\n\n  Because Solorzano-Patlan burglarized a motor\nvehicle and not a \"building or structure,\" we\nhold that his 1995 Lake County, Illinois,\nconviction under 720 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/19-1(a),\nis not a \"burglary offense\" within the meaning of\n8 U.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(G). Accordingly, the\nBIA erred in using section 1101(a)(43)(G) as a\nbasis for Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s removal.\n\nB. The Definition of \"Crime of Violence\" in 8\nU.S.C. sec. 1101(a)(43)(F)\n\f  The INS also argues that Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s\nburglary of a motor vehicle constitutes a \"crime\nof violence\" and, therefore, supports the BIA\u2019s\ndecision to deport him from this country. The INS\nfollows the formalistic approach adopted by the\nFifth Circuit, see, e.g., United States v. Ramon-\nGarcia, 95 F.3d 369, 371 (5th Cir. 1996), and\nargues that Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s burglary\nconviction is necessarily a crime of violence\nbecause burglary \"by its nature\" involves\n\"substantial risk that physical force . . . may\nbe used.\" On the other hand, Solorzano-Patlan\nargues that the INS must make an individualized\nanalysis of whether his conduct carried a\nsubstantial risk that force would be used against\npersons or property.\n\n  The INA defines \"aggravated felony\" as including\n\"a crime of violence . . . for which the term of\nimprisonment [is] at least one year.\" 8 U.S.C.\nsec. 1101(a)(43)(F). \"Crime of violence,\" in\nturn, is defined in relevant part as an \"offense\nthat is a felony and that, by its nature,\ninvolves a substantial risk that physical force\nagainst the person or property of another may be\nused in the course of committing the offense.\" 18\nU.S.C. sec. 16(b)./10\n\n  The Illinois statute under which Solorzano-\nPatlan was convicted, defines \"burglary\" broadly,\nencompassing both conduct that does involve a\nsubstantial risk that physical force may be used\nand conduct that does not involve a substantial\nrisk that physical force may be used. See 720\nIll. Comp. Stats. 5/19-1(a); compare People v.\nFrey, 467 N.E.2d 302, 303 (Ill. App. Ct. 1984)\n(affirming the burglary conviction of a defendant\nwho took a sledgehammer from the open bed of an\nunattended pickup truck) with State v. Stone, 653\nN.E.2d 1311, 1312 (Ill. App. Ct. 1995) (affirming\nthe burglary conviction of a defendant who\nsmashed the driver\u2019s side window and \"busted out\"\nthe steering column of a Toyota sedan in order to\nhot-wire the car). Because different levels of\ncriminal conduct will result in a conviction\nunder 720 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/19-1(a), the\nstatute is a \"divisible statute,\" and \"[w]hen the\nstatutory definition of a criminal offense\nencompasses conduct that does not constitute a\ncrime of violence as well as conduct that does\nconstitute a crime of violence, an [IJ] may not\nsimply categorize all conduct covered by the\noffense as crime of violence conduct.\" Xiong, 173\nF.3d at 605; see also United States v. Nelson,\n143 F.3d 373, 374-75 (7th Cir. 1998) (rejecting\na per se rule in determining whether defendant\u2019s\nconviction for burglary was a \"crime of violence\"\nunder U.S.S.G. sec. 2K2.1(a)(6)); United States\nv. Fife, 81 F.3d 62, 64 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"looking\n\fbeyond the name of the law\" in determining\nwhether defendant\u2019s conviction for \"armed\nviolence\" was a violent felony under 18 U.S.C.\nsec. 924(e)); In re Sweetser, BIA Int. Dec. 3390,\n1999 WL 311950 (May 19, 1999) (\"The statute\u2019s\ndivisibility . . . allows a court to go beyond\nthe mere fact of conviction.\").\n\n  Consequently, the IJ erred in limiting his\nreview to the language and title of the statute\nbecause, in our opinion, it is impossible to\nclassify Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s offense by merely\nreading the statutory language. The IJ should\nhave also reviewed and analyzed the charging\npapers, including the complaint, in order that he\nmight, before he makes a decision as to whether\nSolorzano-Patlan should be deported from this\ncountry, determine whether the conduct for which\nSolorzano-Patlan was convicted of involved a\n\"substantial risk that physical force . . . [may]\nbe used.\" Xiong, 173 F.3d at 604.\n\n  Accordingly, we GRANT Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s petition\nfor review, VACATE the deportation order of the BIA\ndated August 31, 1999, and REMAND for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n/1 Solorzano-Patlan entered the United States in\n1980 and became a lawful permanent resident in\n1989, when he was about twelve. Also, he is the\nfather of a one-year-old U.S. citizen child, and\nis engaged to marry the child\u2019s mother.\n\n/2 720 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/19-1(a) provides, \"[a]\nperson commits burglary when without authority he\nknowingly enters or without authority remains\nwithin a building, house trailer, watercraft,\naircraft, motor vehicle as defined in the\nIllinois Vehicle Code, railroad car, or any part\nthereof, with intent to commit therein a felony\nor theft.\" (emphasis added).\n\n/3 Solorzano-Patlan was also sentenced to perform\n125 hours of public service work, assessed a fine\nof $200, and ordered to pay $610 in restitution.\n\n/4 See 730 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/5-8-1.1(b)(8) (\"In\norder to be eligible to participate in the impact\nincarceration program . . . The Department may\nalso consider . . . whether the committed person\nhas any outstanding detainers or warrants . . .\n.\").\n\n/5 We note that it is rather obvious that some\nphysical force is necessary in factual situations\nsuch as this. For example, one must insert and\nturn a key to release the lock as well as turn\nthe handle to open a car door, and one must then\n\fuse force to pull the door open. We address the\nissue of the amount of force necessary to trigger\nthis section later in the opinion.\n\n/6 Solorzano-Patlan also contends that his original\nterm of imprisonment was less than one year and\nthat, absent the INS detainer, he would have been\neligible for \"boot camp.\" The problem with this\nargument is that Solorzano-Patlan was sentenced\nto the three-year maximum after his probation was\nrevoked, and the relevant inquiry is whether the\npossible maximum sentence that could have been\nimposed is at least a year. Because it is\nuncontested that Solorzano-Patlan\u2019s conviction\ncarried a possible sentence of at least a year\n(he received three), we need not address this\nargument any further.\n\n/7 As we shall see, the states within the Seventh\nCircuit: Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, all\nuse different criteria to categorize basically\nthe same conduct. That is, burglary in one state\nis not burglary in another state.\n\n/8 In contrast, a per se rule might be appropriate\nfor vehicular burglaries of occupied vehicles\nunder 720 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/12-11.1 (\"vehicular\ninvasion\").\n\n/9 See generally Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S.\n411, 422 (1990) (lenity principles \"demand\nresolution of ambiguities in criminal statutes in\nfavor of the defendant\"); Liparota v. United\nStates, 471 U.S. 419, 427 (1985) (\"Application of\nthe rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes\nwill provide fair warning concerning conduct\nrendered illegal and strikes the appropriate\nbalance between the legislature, the prosecutor,\nand the court in defining criminal liability.\").\n\n/10 We note that the force necessary to trigger this\nsection is more than merely opening a car door.\nWe are of the opinion that the force necessary to\nconstitute a crime of violence, must actually be\nviolent in nature. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n1147 (6th Ed. 1990) (defining physical force as\n\"[f]orce applied to the body; actual violence.\").\n\"In coming to this conclusion, we emphasize that\nthe relevant inquiry is whether the conduct\ninvolved a substantial risk of physical force,\nnot whether physical force was actually used.\"\nXiong, 173 F.3d at 607.\n\f",
