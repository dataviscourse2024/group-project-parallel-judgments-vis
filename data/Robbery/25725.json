Clarence D. Schreane seeks a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Specifically, Schreane argues that the police violated his Fifth Amendment\nrights when they denied his request for an attorney while being questioned at the police station.\nIn the alternative, Schreane argues that the police officers\u2019 promises of leniency also made his\nconfession involuntary. Due to the proper deference afforded to the state court, we affirm the\ndistrict court\u2019s denial of Schreane\u2019s writ of habeas corpus.\n\n                           FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The following factual background is taken from the Tennessee Court of Criminal\nAppeals\u2019 (\u201cTCCA\u201d) opinion on direct appeal of Schreane\u2019s conviction:\n\n       This case relates to the defendant\u2019s participation in the killing of Marcus Edwards\n       on September 19, 1991. The Chattanooga Police Department investigated the\n       murder; however, the case went cold and remained unsolved for eight years. In\n       1999, the defendant was incarcerated on unrelated charges when he contacted\n       Chattanooga Police Department detectives and told them he had information\n       related to the unsolved 1991 murder. The detectives had the defendant brought to\n       their location to speak with him, and after a period of a few hours, the defendant\n       confessed.\n\n       At the trial, the evidence showed that the defendant accompanied Charles Turner\n       to the victim\u2019s place of business to help Mr. Turner commit a robbery. As the\n       victim was talking to Mr. Turner, the defendant struck the victim with a rock, and\n       Mr. Turner then shot the victim with a .38 caliber handgun. Mr. Turner took the\n       victim\u2019s .357 magnum handgun, which was on the victim\u2019s body. Mr. Turner\n       also took a cigar box containing cash and gave the defendant one hundred dollars\n       as both men fled the scene in the defendant\u2019s 1983 Cadillac Eldorado.\n\n       Before the trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress his confession, arguing\n       that it was taken in violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. At\n       the motion to suppress hearing, Chattanooga Police Department Detective Mike\n       Mathis testified that he was the lead investigator for the 1991 murder. He said the\n       victim was shot to death and found in his business. Detective Mathis said few\n       solid leads developed until the defendant contacted them.\n\fNo. 15-6141                          Schreane v. Ebbert                                 Page 3\n\n\n     Detective Mathis said that sometime before September 19, 1999, Chattanooga\n     Police Department Lieutenant Steve Angel had been receiving collect telephone\n     calls from the Hamilton County Jail, which he was unable to answer. He said that\n     the defendant's \u201csignificant other\u201d contacted the detectives and told them the\n     defendant wanted to talk to them about an unsolved murder. He said the\n     defendant also called and spoke with Lt. Angel and told him enough specific\n     information about the murder to cause Lt. Angel to have the defendant transported\n     from the Hamilton County Jail to the police service center.\n\n     Detective Mathis said he conducted an interview with the defendant, culminating\n     in a tape-recorded statement. He said that although the defendant was in custody\n     on unrelated charges, he was not under arrest or charged with the victim\u2019s murder\n     when he confessed. Detective Mathis said he did not promise the defendant\n     anything in return for his confession. Detective Mathis said the defendant waived\n     his constitutional right to remain silent and to an attorney before making the tape-\n     recorded statement.\n\n     On cross-examination, Det. Mathis said he talked with the defendant for some\n     period of time before reading him his Miranda rights. He admitted that before he\n     arrived to interview the defendant, Lt. Angel had been talking to the defendant.\n     Detective Mathis said that although he did not promise the defendant anything\n     specific in return for his confession, he did explain to the defendant that he would\n     tell the district attorney general\u2019s office that the defendant had come forward on\n     his own and cooperated with the police. Detective Mathis admitted that he may\n     have told the defendant he would try to help transport the defendant from the\n     Hamilton County Jail to Silverdale, a state correctional facility.\n\n     On redirect examination, Det. Mathis said the defendant initiated the contact with\n     the police department. Detective Mathis explained that the reason for the delay in\n     reading the defendant his Miranda rights was the defendant initially maintained\n     that he had only heard about the murder, not that he had any involvement in it.\n     He said the defendant ultimately \u201ccame clean\u201d and confessed.\n\n     The defendant testified that when he first arrived at the police service center, he\n     was placed in an interview room with Det. Carroll and Det. Mathis. He said Lt.\n     Angel entered the room later. The defendant said Det. Mathis told him he\n     believed \u201cthe bicycle bandit\u201d was responsible for the victim\u2019s murder. The\n     defendant said that he then asked to speak with his attorney but that Det. Mathis\n     told him he did not need an attorney. The defendant said Det. Mathis made\n     promises to him before the taping began. He said Det. Mathis promised him that\n     the defendant would not be charged with the murder, that Det. Mathis would\n     speak with the defendant\u2019s parole officer in another case, and that Det. Mathis\n     would speak with the district attorney general\u2019s office in order to have them\n     dismiss certain charges against the defendant from another case in return for the\n     defendant\u2019s cooperation. He said Det. Mathis also promised to transfer him from\n\f No. 15-6141                              Schreane v. Ebbert                                   Page 4\n\n\n         the Hamilton County Jail to Silverdale. The defendant said he was transferred to\n         Silverdale two days later. The defendant said he did not sign the waiver form\n         until after the taped statement was made.\n\nState v. Schreane, No. E2005-00520-CCA-R3CD, 2006 WL 891394, at *1\u20132 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nApr. 5, 2006), perm. app. denied (Aug. 28, 2006).\n\n         A jury convicted Schreane of first degree felony murder and aggravated robbery, for\nwhich he received consecutive sentences of life imprisonment and sixty years of incarceration,\nrespectively. Id. at *1. Schreane\u2019s convictions were affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA, and\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court (\u201cTSC\u201d) denied permission to appeal. Id.\n\n         The trial court denied Schreane\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, the TCCA affirmed\nthis denial, and the TSC denied permission to appeal. Schreane v. State, No. E2009-01103-\nCCA-R3-PC, 2010 WL 3919264 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 7, 2010), perm app. denied (Jan. 18,\n2011).\n\n         After post-conviction relief was denied, Schreane filed a petition for writ of error coram\nnobis, which the trial court denied. The TCCA affirmed this denial, and the TSC denied\npermission to appeal. Schreane v. State, No. E2012-01202-CCA-R3-PC, 2013 WL 173193\n(Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 16, 2013), perm. app. denied (May 7, 2013), petition to rehear denied\n(June 4, 2013).\n\n         Schreane then filed a motion to reopen his post-conviction proceedings, which the trial\ncourt alternatively construed as another petition for a writ of error coram nobis. The trial court\ndenied this motion, the TCCA affirmed the denial, and the TSC denied permission to appeal.\nSchreane v. State, No. E2012-00954-CCA-R3-CO, 2013 WL 5516430 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 2,\n2013), perm. app. denied (Oct. 2, 2013). Schreane also filed a motion to dismiss his indictment\nin the trial court, which the trial court construed as a petition for state habeas relief. This petition\nwas denied, and the TCCA affirmed on appeal. Schreane v. State, No. E2013-1161-CCA-R3-\nHC, 2013 WL 62295227 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 2, 2013).\n\n         Schreane then filed two petitions for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254. The district court denied Schreane\u2019s requests for relief but granted a certificate of\n\f No. 15-6141                            Schreane v. Ebbert                                 Page 5\n\n\nappealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on one issue: whether Schreane\u2019s confession should have been excluded\nfrom trial due to the denial of his request for counsel and the length of time he was questioned\nbefore police informed him of his Miranda rights. We denied Schreane\u2019s request to expand this\nCOA and limited this appeal to that single issue.\n\n                   STANDARD OF REVIEW AND LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a writ of habeas corpus. Mendoza\nv. Berghuis, 544 F.3d 650, 652 (6th Cir. 2008). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, a court considering a habeas claim must\ndefer to any decision by a state court concerning the claim, unless the state court\u2019s judgment:\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the\nUnited States Supreme Court; (2) involved unreasonable application of clearly established\nfederal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court; or (3) was based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).\n\n       In Williams v. Taylor, the Court explained that this analysis involves a two-part inquiry:\nfirst, whether the state court correctly identified the governing legal rule; and second, whether\nthe state court applied that rule in an objectively reasonable way to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s\ncase. 529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000).\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\nI.     Fifth Amendment Right to Counsel/Miranda\n\n       Schreane argues that \u201conce he requested counsel, officers should have ended their\ninterrogation of him.\u201d According to Schreane, \u201cthis failure rendered his subsequent confession\ninadmissible.\u201d Appellant Br. 10. Specifically, Schreane argues that Miranda \u201crequire[s] police\nofficers to cease questioning a suspect who unequivocally invokes his right to counsel [and]\n[p]olice cannot use statements made after the suspect requests counsel if those subsequent\nstatements are the result of further police-initiated interrogation.\u201d       McKinney v. Hoffner,\n830 F.3d 363, 370 (6th Cir. 2016).\n\f No. 15-6141                            Schreane v. Ebbert                                  Page 6\n\n\n       In response, the State argues that because Schreane was not \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda\npurposes, the police officers were not required to provide an attorney. See United States v.\nMalcolm, 435 F. App\u2019x 417, 420 (6th Cir. 2011) (finding that a suspect who mentioned speaking\nto counsel was not \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda purposes and was therefore not entitled to counsel\nunder Miranda); see also Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 485\u201386 (1981) (holding that there is\nno infringement of the right to counsel absent custodial interrogation).\n\n   a. Correct Legal Rule\n\n       As the Court explained in Williams, the threshold inquiry is whether the state court\ncorrectly identified the governing legal rule. The Fifth Amendment guarantees that an individual\nhas the right not to be \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d\nU.S. CONST. amend. V. The \u201cclearly established\u201d federal law applicable to petitioner\u2019s claim is\nset out in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). In Miranda, the Court held that a suspect\nmust be informed of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, among other rights,\nprior to custodial interrogation by police.       Id. at 444.    To determine whether custodial\ninterrogation exists, the Court defined the term as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement\nofficers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action\nin any significant way.\u201d Id. However, the Court has clarified that questioning initiated by the\naccused is not interrogation for Miranda purposes. Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484.\n\n       In this case, the state court correctly identified the legal rule by stating that \u201cthe record\ndoes not reflect that [Schreane] was under custodial interrogation before the police read him the\nMiranda warnings and obtained his waiver of rights.\u201d Schreane, 2010 WL 3919264, at *9.\n\n   b. Objectively Reasonable Adjudication\n\n       After ensuring that the correct legal rule was used, we turn to whether the state court\u2019s\nadjudication of the claim was objectively reasonable.           In Williams, the Supreme Court\ndistinguished between an \u201cincorrect or erroneous application\u201d of federal law and an\n\u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law. 529 U.S. at 410. The focus of the review, according\nto the Supreme Court, is not whether the federal court would find a constitutional violation if\npresented with a factual scenario identical to that in the state court, but the reasonableness of the\n\f No. 15-6141                                   Schreane v. Ebbert                                          Page 7\n\n\nstate court\u2019s decision in light of the evidence before it. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 184\u2013\n85 (2011).\n\n        In finding that Schreane\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated, the state court\nrelied on the fact that Schreane initiated contact with police to find that he was not subjected to\ncustodial interrogation when he requested an attorney. See State v. Schreane, No- E2005-00520-\nCCA-R3CD, 2006 WL 891394, at *4\u20135 (Apr. 5, 2006) (\u201cThe record reflects that the defendant\ninitiated the questioning in this case by voluntarily seeking out the detectives and speaking to\nthem concerning the victim's murder. In this regard, we conclude the record does not reflect that\nthe defendant was under custodial interrogation before the police read him the Miranda warnings\nand obtained his waiver of rights. The defendant is not entitled to relief on this issue.\u201d); see also\nState v. Schreane, No-E2009-01103-CCA-R3-PC, 2010 WL 3919264 (Oct. 7, 2010) (\u201cThe\nrecord reflects that the Petitioner initiated the questioning in this case by voluntarily seeking out\nthe detectives and speaking to them concerning the victim\u2019s murder. As a result, the Petitioner\nwas not subject to custodial interrogation when he initiated communication with the\ndetectives.\u201d).1\n\n        While it is correct that suspect-initiated contact with the police is not custody for\nMiranda purposes, see Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484, our analysis should not stop there as a few\nissues must be resolved in this case. First, it must be determined whether the state court\u2019s\ndetermination that Schreane initiated the contact with police was an unreasonable determination\nof the facts as presented to the state court. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Schreane asserts that he did not\nmake any calls to police. However, this assertion is in direct contradiction with the evidence in\nstate court. In testimony to the trial court at both the pretrial suppression hearing and at the post-\nconviction hearing, Schreane stated that, although someone else initially contacted the police on\nhis behalf, he made the call to the police on the day he was taken to the police station for\nquestioning. Schreane also stated in his memorandum in support of his petition for post-\nconviction relief that he initiated contact with police to discuss the murder. Therefore, it was not\n\n        1\n           The district court relied on the 2006 state court opinion. There is an argument that the 2010 state court\nopinion is \u201cthe last reasoned state-court opinion.\u201d Yist v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 804\u201305 (1991). However,\nboth opinions rely on the same reasoning and were used interchangeably in the parties\u2019 briefs. Therefore, reliance on\neither case does not change the analysis.\n\f No. 15-6141                             Schreane v. Ebbert                                 Page 8\n\n\nan unreasonable determination of the facts for the state court to conclude that Schreane originally\ninitiated the contact with the police prior to questioning.\n\n        Second, the completeness of the state court\u2019s decision must be examined. As the district\ncourt noted, the state court did not analyze whether Schreane\u2019s request to confer with counsel\nrepresented Schreane\u2019s withdrawing his initiation of the discussion. Furthermore, the state court\ndid not analyze whether Schreane\u2019s request for counsel supports a finding that the police, rather\nthan Schreane, initiated the discussion about the murder that followed the request for counsel.\nWith this failure, it might be difficult to find that the state court\u2019s decision was objectively\nreasonable under Edwards. See Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484\u201385 (\u201cWe further hold that an accused,\nsuch as Edwards, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not\nsubject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him,\nunless the accused initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the\npolice.\u201d).\n\n        However, we can still deny Schreane\u2019s petition as long as the police-initiated discussion\ndid not \u201cpresent a serious danger of coercion\u201d and Schreane felt that he could terminate the\ninterrogation and leave. Howes v. Fields, 565 U.S. 499, 508\u201309 (2012). Although Howes was\nnot \u201cclearly established federal law\u201d at the time of the state court\u2019s opinions, both parties agree\nthat Howes is instructive in this case. In Howes, the Supreme Court eschewed a bright line rule\nof determining whether a defendant, who was incarcerated on an unrelated offense, was \u201cin\ncustody\u201d when subjected to questioning for another offense, and instead, the Supreme Court\nannounced factors to consider. The factors include: (1) the location of the questioning; (2) the\nduration of the questioning; (3) statements made during the questioning; (4) the presence of\nphysical restraints; and (5) the release of the inmate after the questioning. Id. at 509.\n\n        Applying these factors to this case, we must defer to the state court\u2019s determination that\nSchreane was not in custody for Miranda purposes prior to being Mirandized because such a\ndetermination was not unreasonable. Specifically, three factors weigh in favor of finding that\nSchreane was not in custody. First, statements made during the questioning show that Schreane\nwas not a suspect during the interrogation. The murder had occurred eight years prior and\nSchreane had never been questioned. The police officers began the discussion by indicating that\n\f No. 15-6141                                  Schreane v. Ebbert                                         Page 9\n\n\nthey believed that a \u201cbicycle bandit\u201d had committed the murder. Furthermore, Detective Mathis\ntestified that officers never browbeat Schreane, but instead were \u201call ears\u201d during the\ndiscussion.2 Second, the lack of physical restraints also weighs in favor of finding that Schreane\nwas not in custody. As the district court noted, \u201cthere is no indication that Petitioner was\nrestrained at any point during the questioning.\u201d Third, the release of Schreane after questioning\nis also a factor that weighs in favor of finding that he was not in custody. At the conclusion of\nthe discussion, Schreane was not arrested for his role in the murder, but rather he was released\nback to Hamilton County Jail\u2014the same jail in which he had been incarcerated prior to the\nquestioning. Schreane was not indicted for the murder until approximately three years after the\nquestioning.\n\n        While these three factors weigh in favor of finding that Schreane was not in custody\nduring the questioning, at least one factor weighs against such finding: the duration of the\nquestioning. As the district court noted, the questioning took over four hours before police\ninformed Schreane of his Miranda rights. However, the fact that at least one factor weighs\nagainst the state court\u2019s ruling is not enough. The deference afforded by ADEPA bars granting\nSchreane relief in this case. See Simpson, 651 F. App\u2019x at 355 (\u201cBecause some factors suggest\nthat Simpson was in custody on April 24, and others do not, AEDPA bars us from granting\nSimpson relief on this claim.\u201d).\n\n        Therefore, the state court\u2019s ruling was objectively reasonable in finding that Schreane\nwas not in custody for Miranda purposes. An individual who is not in Miranda custody \u201chas no\nconstitutional right to counsel.\u201d Malcolm, 435 F. App\u2019x at 420. The police were not required to\nprovide Schreane an attorney or cease questioning him. Schreane\u2019s confession was properly\nadmitted at trial.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n         Schreane argues in his reply brief that the alleged promises made by police should be considered in the\n\u201cstatements made during questioning\u201d prong. While in some cases that may be true, any promises made to\nSchreane, in this case, provide little insight as to whether he was in custody. For example, police could offer the\nsame promises to an inmate who is not a suspect in order to solve the crime quickly and efficiently.\n\f No. 15-6141                            Schreane v. Ebbert                               Page 10\n\n\nII.    Promise of Leniency\n\n       Schreane also argues that his confession was involuntary because it was a product of a\npromise of leniency. Specifically, Schreane argues that the police promised to \u201ctell the district\nattorney\u2019s office that Petitioner had cooperated, that they would attempt to secure a transfer for\nPetitioner from county jail to Silverdale, and that they would allow Petitioner to see his\ngirlfriend.\u201d However, that issue is outside the scope of the COA.\n\n       We denied Schreane\u2019s motion to expand his COA. In the order, we \u201cdirected . . . a\nbriefing schedule on the claims for which the district court granted a COA: whether Schreane\u2019s\nconfession should have been excluded from trial due to the denial of his request for counsel and\nthe length of time he was questioned before police informed him of his Miranda rights.\u201d The\nState is correct in arguing that this issue is outside the scope of the COA; therefore, we will not\ndecide the issue.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f No. 15-6141                           Schreane v.

I concur in Judge Siler\u2019s opinion for the Court.\nI write separately to briefly emphasize two unusual facts in this case that compel us to deny\nPetitioner Clarence Schreane\u2019s request for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\n       First, Schreane was never a suspect in Marcus Edwards\u2019 murder until he voluntarily\ncontacted the police through a third party and apparently offered to trade information related to\nthe Edwards murder for relief on unrelated charges that he was facing. See State v. Schreane,\nNo. E2005-00520-CCA-R3CD, 2006 WL 891394, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 5, 2006). The\nEdwards case had gone cold for nearly eight years, and Schreane likely would have escaped\ndetection entirely if he had not brought his involvement in the murder to the police\u2019s attention.\nUnder these circumstances, as Judge Siler rightly concludes, the Tennessee Court of Criminal\nAppeals did not unreasonably determine that Schreane was not \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda\npurposes at the outset of his interview with the police because Schreane initiated the interview.\nSee Slip. Op. at 7\u20138; see also Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484 (1981) (holding that a\nsuspect is not in custody for Miranda purposes when he initiates contact with the police).\n\n       Second, Schreane testified before the Tennessee trial court that he asked to speak with an\nattorney near the outset of his conversation with the police after Detective Mathis \u201ctold him he\nbelieved \u2018the bicycle bandit\u2019 was responsible for [Edwards\u2019] murder.\u201d Schreane, 2006 WL\n891394, at *2. In other words, Schreane asked to speak with counsel shortly into an interview\nthat he initiated after the police had told him that they suspected someone else of the crime, and\nbefore Schreane had made any statements inculpating himself. Thus, at the moment Schreane\nasked to speak with an attorney, he cannot possibly have been \u201cin custody\u201d for Edwards\u2019 murder\nbecause the police lacked any inkling that Schreane was involved in the crime. This may well\nhave been a different case if Schreane had renewed his request for counsel after the conversation\nhad turned to his own involvement in the Edwards murder.\n\f No. 15-6141                            Schreane v. Ebbert                             Page 12\n\n\n       In sum, this case presents an unusual fact pattern where the defendant appears to have\nbeen entirely responsible both for: (i) initiating contact with the police; and (ii) causing the\npolice to suspect him of a crime. The police in this case were very nearly bystanders at the\nbeginning of the interview, and had their case against Schreane more or less hand-delivered to\nthem through Schreane\u2019s own bungled attempt at bargaining for relief from other charges. The\nCourt\u2019s opinion must be understood in this context, and should not be misconstrued as broadly\nholding that defendants will rarely or never be \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda purposes, without\nregard to the facts of the matter, when they initiate contact with the police.      With these\nobservations, I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion.\n\f",

CLAY, J,.(pp, 464-55), delivered a separate concurring opinion,\nOPINION\nSILER, Circuit Judge.\nClarence D. Schreane seeks a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Specifically, Schreane argues that the police violated his Fifth Amendment rights when they denied his request for an attorney while being questioned at the police station. In the alternative, Schreane argues that the police officers\u2019 promises of leniency also made his confession involuntary. Due to the proper deference afforded to the state court, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Schreane\u2019s writ of habeas corpus.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nThe following factual background is taken from the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 (\u201cTCCA\u201d) opinion on direct appeal of Schreane\u2019s conviction:\nThis case relates to the defendant\u2019s participation in the killing of Marcus Edwards on September 19,1991. The Chattanooga Police Department investigated the murder; however, the case went cold and remained unsolved for eight years. In 1999, the defendant w\u00e1s incarcerated on unrelated charges when he contacted Chattanooga Police Department detectives and told them he had information related to the unsolved 1991 murder. The detectives had the defendant brought to their location to speak with him, \u00a1and after a period of a few hours, the defendant confessed.\nAt the -trial, the evidence showed that the defendant accompanied Charles Turner to the victim\u2019s place of business: to help Mr. Turner commit a robbery. As the victim was. talking to Mr. Turner, the defendant struck the victim with a rock, and Mr, Turner then shot the victim with a .38 caliber handgun. Mr. Turner took the victim\u2019s .357 .magnum handgun, which was on the victim\u2019s body. Mr, Turner also took a cigar box containing cash and gave the defendant, one hundred dollars as both men fled the scene in the defendant\u2019s 1983 Cadillac Eldorado.\nBefore the trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress his confession, arguing that it was taken in violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. At the motion to suppress hearing, Chattanooga Police Department Detective Mike Mathis testified that he was the lead investigator for the 1991 murder. He said the victim was shot to death and found in his business. Detective Mathis said few solid leads developed until the defendant contacted them,\nDetective Mathis said that sometime before September 19, 1999, Chattanooga Police Department Lieutenant Steve An*449gel had been receiving collect telephone calls from the Hamilton County Jail, which he was unable to answer. He said that the defendant\u2019s \u201csignificant other\u201d contacted the detectives and told them the defendant wanted to talk to them about an unsolved murder. He said the defendant also called and spoke with Lt. Angel and told him enough specific information about the murder to cause Lt. Angel to have the defendant transported from the Hamilton County Jail to the police service center.\nDetective Mathis said he conducted an interview with the defendant, culminating in a tape-recorded statement. He said that although the defendant was in custody on unrelated charges, he was not under arrest or charged with the victim\u2019s murder when he confessed. Detective Mathis said he did not promise the defendant anything in return for his confession. Detective Mathis said the defendant waived his constitutional right to remain silent and to an attorney before 'making the tape-recorded statement.\nOn cross-examination, Det. Mathis said he talked with the defendant for some period of time before reading him his Miranda rights. He admitted that before he arrived to interview the defendant, Lt. Angel had been talking to the defendant. Detective Mathis said that although he did not promise the defendant anything specific in return for his confession, he did explain to the defendant that he would tell the district attorney general\u2019s office that the defendant had come forward on his own and cooperated with the police. Detective Mathis admitted that he may have told the defendant he would try to help transport the defendant from the Hamilton County Jail to Silverdale, a state correctional facility.\nOn. redirect examination, \u25a0 Det. Mathis said-the defendant initiated the contact with the police department. Detective Mathis explained that the reason for the delay in reading the defendant his Miranda rights was the defendant initially maintained that he had only heard about the murder, not that, he had any involvement in it, He said the defendant ultimately .\u201ccame clean\u201d and confessed.\nThe defendant testified that when he first arrived at the police service center, he was placed in an -interview room with Det. Carroll and Det. Mathis. He said Lt. Angel entered the room later. The defendant said Det. Mathis told him he believed \u201cthe bicycle bandit\u201d was responsible for the victim\u2019s murder. The defendant said that he then asked to speak with his attorney but that Det. Mathis told him he did not need an attorney. The defendant said Det. Mathis made promises to him before the taping began. He said Det. Mathis promised him that the defendant would not be charged with the murder, that Det. Mathis would speak with the defendant\u2019s parole officer in another case, and that Det. Mathis would speak with .the district attorney general\u2019s -office in order to have . them dismiss certain charges against the defendant from another case in return for the defendant\u2019s cooperation. He said Det. Mathis also promised to transfer him from the Hamilton County Jail to Silverdale. The defendant said he was transferred to Silverdale two days later. The defendant said he did not sign the waiver form until after the taped statement was made.\nState v. Schreane, No. E2005-00520-CCA-R3CD, 2006 WL 891394, at *1-2 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 5, 2006), perm. app. denied (Aug. 28, 2006).\nA jury convicted Schreane of first degree felony murder and aggravated rob*450bery, for which he received consecutive sentences of life imprisonment and sixty years of incarceration, respectively. Id. at *1. Schreane\u2019s convictions were affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA, and the Tennessee Supreme Court (\u201cTSC\u201d) denied permission to appeal. Id.\nThe trial court denied Schreane\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, the TCCA affirmed this denial, and the TSC denied permission to appeal. Schreane v. State, No. E2009-01103-CCA-R3-PC, 2010 WL 3919264 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 7, 2010), perm app. denied (Jan. 18, 2011).\nAfter post-conviction relief was denied, Schreane filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis, which the trial court denied. The TCCA affirmed this denial, and the TSC denied permission to appeal. Schreane v. State, No. E2012-01202-CCA-R3-PC, 2013 WL 173193 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 16, 2013), perm. app. denied (May 7, 2013), petition to rehear denied (June 4, 2013).\nSchreane then filed a motion to reopen his post-conviction proceedings, which the trial court alternatively construed as another petition for a writ of error coram nobis. The trial court denied this motion, the TCCA affirmed the denial, and the TSC denied permission to appeal. Schreane v. State, No. E2012-00954-CCA-R3-CO, 2013 WL 5516430 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 2, 2013), perm. app. denied (Oct. 2, 2013). Schreane also filed a motion to dismiss his indictment in the trial court, which the trial court construed as a petition for state habeas relief. This petition was denied, and the TCCA affirmed on appeal. Schreane v. State, No. E2013-1161-CCA-R3-HC, 2013 WL 6229527 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 2, 2013).\nSchreane then filed two petitions for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied Schreane\u2019s requests for relief but granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on one issue: whether Schreane\u2019s confession should have been excluded from trial due to the denial of his request for counsel and the length of time he was questioned before police informed him of his Miranda rights. We denied Schreane\u2019s request to expand this COA and limited this appeal to that single issue.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW AND LEGAL STANDARD\nWe review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a writ of habeas corpus. Mendoza v. Berghuis, 544 F.3d 650, 652 (6th Cir. 2008). Under the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, a court considering a habeas claim must defer to any decision by a state court concerning the claim, unless the state court\u2019s judgment: (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court; (2) involved unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court; or (3) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).\nIn Williams v. Taylor, the Court explained that this analysis involves a two-part inquiry: first, whether the state court correctly identified the governing legal rule; and second, whether the state court applied that rule in an objectively reasonable way to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case. 529 U.S. 362, 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).\nDISCUSSION\nI. Fifth Amendment Right to Counsel/Miranda\nSchreane argues that \u201conce he requested counsel, officers should have ended *451their interrogation of him.\u201d According to Schreane, \u201cthis failure rendered his subsequent confession inadmissible.\u201d Appellant Br. 10. Specifically, Schreane argues that Miranda \u201crequire[s] police officers to cease questioning a suspect who unequivocally invokes his right to counsel [and] [p]olice cannot use statements made after the suspect requests counsel if those subsequent statements are the result of further police-initiated interrogation.\u201d McKinney v. Hoffner, 830 F.3d 363, 370 (6th Cir. 2016).\nIn response, the State argues that because Schreane was not \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda purposes, the police officers were not required to provide an attorney. See United States v. Malcolm, 435 Fed.Appx. 417, 420 (6th Cir. 2011) (finding that a suspect who mentioned speaking to counsel was not \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda purposes and was therefore not entitled to counsel under Miranda); see also Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 485-86, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) (holding that there is no infringement of the right to counsel absent custodial interrogation).\na. Correct Legal Rule\nAs the Court explained in Williams, the threshold inquiry is whether the state court correctly identified the governing legal rule. The Fifth Amendment guarantees that an individual has the right not to be \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. The \u201cclearly established\u201d federal law applicable to petitioner\u2019s claim is set out in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In Miranda, the Court held that a suspect must be informed of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, among other rights, prior to custodial interrogation by police. Id. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602. To determine whether custodial interrogation exists, the Court defined the term as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Id. However, the Court has clarified that questioning initiated by the accused is not interrogation for Miranda purposes. Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484, 101 S.Ct. 1880.\nIn this case, the state court correctly identified the legal rule by stating that \u201cthe record does not reflect that [Schreane] was under custodial interrogation before the police read him the Miranda warnings and obtained his waiver of rights.\u201d Schreane, 2010 WL 3919264, at *9.\nb. Objectively Reasonable Adjudication\nAfter ensuring that the correct legal rule was used, we turn to whether the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claim was objectively reasonable. In Williams, the Supreme Court distinguished between an \u201cincorrect or erroneous application\u201d of federal law and an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law. 529 U.S. at 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495. The focus of the review, according to the Supreme Court, is not whether the federal court would find a constitutional violation if presented with a factual scenario identical to that in the state court, but the reasonableness of the state court\u2019s decision in light of the evidence before it. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 184-85, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011).\nIn finding that Schreane\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated, the state court relied on the fact that Schreane initiated contact with police to find that he was not subjected to custodial interrogation when he requested an attorney. See State v. Schreane, No-E2005-00520-CCA-R3CD, 2006 WL 891394, at *4-5 (Apr. 5, 2006) (\u201cThe record reflects that the defendant initiated the questioning in this case by *452voluntarily seeking out the detectives and speaking to them concerning the victim\u2019s murder. In this regard, we conclude the record does not reflect that the defendant was under custodial interrogation before the police read him the Miranda warnings and obtained his waiver of rights. The defendant is not entitled to relief on this issue.\u201d); see also Schreane v. State, No-E2009-01103-CCA-R3-PC, 2010 WL 3919264 (Oct. 7, 2010) (\u201cThe record reflects that the Petitioner initiated the questioning in this case by voluntarily seeking out the detectives and speaking to them concerning the victim\u2019s murder. As a result, the Petitioner was not subject to custodial interrogation when he initiated communication with the detectives.\u201d).1\nWhile it is correct that suspect-initiated contact with the police is not custody for Miranda purposes, see Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484, 101 S.Ct. 1880, our analysis should not stop there as a few issues must be resolved in this case. First, it must be determined whether the state court\u2019s determination that Schreane initiated the contact with police was an unreasonable determination of the facts as presented to the state court. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Schreane asserts that he did not'make any calls to police. However, this assertion is in direct contradiction with the evidence in state court. In testimony to the trial court at both the pretrial suppression hearing and at the post-conviction hearing, Schre-ane stated that, although someone else initially contacted the police on his behalf, he made \u2018the call to the police on the day he was taken to the police station for questioning. Schreane also stated in his memorandum in support of his petition for post-conviction relief that he initiated contact with police to discuss the murder. Therefore, it was not an unreasonable determination of the facts for the state court to conclude that Schreane originally initiated the contact with the police prior to questioning.\nSecond, the completeness of the state court\u2019s decision must be examined. As the district court noted, the state court did not analyze whether Schreane\u2019s request to confer with counsel represented Schre-ane\u2019s withdrawing his initiation of the discussion. Furthermore, the state court did not analyze whether Schreane\u2019s request for \u2022 counsel supports a finding that the police, rather than Schreane, initiated the discussion about the murder that followed the request for counsel. With this failure, it might be difficult to find that the state court\u2019s decision was objectively reasonable under Edwards. See Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880 (\u201cWe further hold that an accused, such as Edwards, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d).\nHowever, we can still deny Schre-ane\u2019s petition as long as the police-initiated discussion did not \u201cpresent- a serious danger of coercion\u201d and Schreane felt that he could terminate the interrogation and leave. Howes v. Fields, 565 U.S. 499, 508-09, 132 S.Ct. 1181, 182 L.Ed.2d 17 (2012). Although Howes was not \u201cclearly established federal law\u201d at the time of the state court\u2019s opinions, both parties agree that *453Howes is instructive in this case. In Howes, the Supreme Court eschewed a bright line rule of determining whether a defendant, who was- incarcerated on an unrelated offense, was \u201cin custody\u201d when subjected to questioning for another offense, and instead, the Supreme Court announced factors to consider. The factors include: (1) the location of the questioning; (2) the duration of the questioning; (3) statements made during the questioning; (4) the presence of physical restraints; and (5) the release of the inmate after the questioning. Id. at 509, 132 S.Ct. 1181.\nApplying these factors to this case, we must defer to the state court\u2019s determination that Schreane was not in custody for Miranda purposes prior to being Miran-dized because such a determination was not unreasonable. Specifically, three factors weigh in favor of finding that Schre-ane was not in custody. First, statements m\u00e1de during the questioning show that Schreane was not a suspect during the interrogation. The murder had occurred eight years prior and Schreane had never been questioned. The police officers began the discussion by indicating that they believed that a \u201cbicycle bandit\u201d had committed the murder. Furthermore, Detective Mathis testified that officers never browbeat Schreane, but instead were \u201call ears\u201d during the discussion.2 Second, the' lack of physical restraints also weighs in favor of-finding that Schreane was not in custody. As the district court noted, \u201cthere is no indication that Petitioner was restrained at any point during the questioning.\u201d Third, the release of Schreane after questioning is also a- factor that weighs in favor of finding that he was not in custody. At the conclusion of the discussion, Schreane was not arrested for his role in the murder, but rather he was released.back to Hamilton County Jail\u2014the same jail in which, he had been incarcerated prior to the questioning. Schreane was not indicted for- the murder until approximately three years after the questioning,.\nWhile these three factors weigh in favor of finding that Schreane was not in custody during the questioning, at least one factor weighs against such finding: the duration of the questioning. As the district court noted, the questioning took over four hours before police informed Schreane of his Mimnda rights; However, the fact that at least one factor weighs against the state court\u2019s ruling is not enough. The deference afforded by ADEPA bars granting Schre-ane relief in this case. See Simpson v. Warden, Warren Correctional Institution, 651 Fed.Appx. 344, 355 (6th Cir. 2016) (\u201cBecause some factors suggest that Simpson was in custody on April 24, and others do not, AEDPA bars us from granting Simpson relief oh'this claim.\u201d).\nTherefore, the state court\u2019s ruling was objectively reasonable in finding that Schreane was not in custody for Miranda purposes. An individual who is not in Miranda custody \u201chas no constitutional right to counsel.\u201d Malcolm, 435 Fed.Appx. at 420. The police were not required to provide Schreane an attorney or cease questioning him. Schreane\u2019s confession was properly admitted at trial.\nII. Promise of Leniency\nSchreane also argues that his confession was involuntary because it was a product of a promise of leniency., Specifi*454cally, Schreane argues that the police promised to \u201ctell the district attorney\u2019s office that Petitioner had cooperated, that they would attempt to secure a transfer for Petitioner from county jail to Silver-dale, and that they would allow Petitioner to see his girlfriend.\u201d However, that issue is outside the scope of the COA.\nWe denied Schreane\u2019s motion to expand his COA. In the order, we \u201cdirected ... a briefing schedule on the claims for which the district court granted a COA: whether Schreane\u2019s confession should have been excluded from trial due to the denial of his request for counsel and the length of time he was questioned before police informed him of his Miranda rights.\u201d The State is correct in arguing that this issue is outside the scope of the COA; therefore, we will not decide the issue.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n. The district court relied on the 2006 state court opinion. There is an argument that the 2010 state court opinion is \"the last reasoned state-court opinion.\u201d Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 804-05, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991). However, both opinions rely on the same reasoning and were used interchangeably in the parties' briefs. Therefore, reliance on either case does not change the analysis.\n\n\n. Schreane argues In his reply brief that the alleged promises made by police should be considered in the \"statements made during questioning\u201d prong. While in some cases that may be true, any promises made to Schreane, in this case, provide little insight as to whether he was in custody. For example, police could offer the same promises to an inmate who is not a suspect -in order to solve the crime quickly and efficiently.\n\n",

I write separately to briefly emphasize two unusual facts in this case that compel us to deny Petitioner Clarence Schreane\u2019s request for a writ of habeas corpus.\nFirst, Schreane was never a suspect in Marcus Edwards\u2019 murder until he voluntarily contacted the police through a third party and apparently offered to trade information related to the Edwards murder for relief on unrelated charges that he was facing. See State v. Schreane, No. E2005-00520-CCA-R3CD, 2006 WL 891394, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 5, 2006). The Edwards case had gone cold for nearly eight years, and Schreane likely would have escaped detection entirely if he had not brought his involvement in the murder to the police\u2019s attention. Under these circumstances, as Judge Siler rightly concludes, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals did not unreasonably determine that Schreane was not \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda purposes at the outset of his interview with the police because Schreane initiated the interview. See Op. at 451-53; see also Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) (holding that a suspect is not in custody for Miranda purposes when he initiates contact with the police).\nSecond, Schreane testified before the Tennessee trial court that he asked to speak with an attorney near the outset of his conversation with the police after Detective Mathis \u201ctold him he believed \u2018the bicycle bandit\u2019 was responsible for [Edwards\u2019] murder.\u201d Schreane, 2006 WL 891394, at *2. In other words, Schreane asked to speak with counsel shortly into an interview that he initiated after the police had told him that they suspected someone else of the crime, and before Schreane had made any statements inculpating himself. Thus, at the moment Schreane asked to speak with an attorney, he cannot possibly have been \u201cin custody\u201d for Edwards\u2019 murder because the police lacked any inkling that Schreane was involved in the crime. This may well have been a different case if Schreane had renewed his request for counsel after the conversation had turned to his own involvement in the Edwards murder.\nIn sum, this case presents an unusual fact pattern where the defendant appears to have been entirely responsible both for: (i) initiating contact with the police; and (ii) causing the police to suspect him of a crime. The police in this case were very nearly bystanders at the beginning of the interview, and had their case against Schreane more or less hand-delivered to them through Schreane\u2019s own bungled attempt at bargaining for relief from other charges. The Court\u2019s opinion must be un*455derstood in this context, and should not be misconstrued as broadly holding that defendants will rarely or never be \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda purposes, without regard to the facts of the matter, when they initiate contact with the police. With these observations, I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion.\n",
