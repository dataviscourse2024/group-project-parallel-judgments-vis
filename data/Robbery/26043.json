Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed an effective sentence of fourteen years' incarceration.

Upon our de novo review of Count 14, we order that the Defendant's two-year sentence on that count be served on supervised probation with the imposition of $1000 fine.

Gookin (at sentencing), Jackson,\nTennessee, for the appellant, Andrew Young Kim.\n\nHerbert H. Slatery III, Attorney General and Reporter; Jonathan H. Wardle, Assistant\nAttorney General; James G. (\u201cJerry\u201d) Woodall, District Attorney General; and Shaun A.\nBrown, Assistant District Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\f                                    OPINION\n                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n        This case arose from multiple incidents of burglary and theft perpetrated by the\nDefendant on five different businesses in the Jackson, Tennessee area. The Defendant\nwas eventually indicted on August 1, 2016, for the following fourteen offenses: Counts 1\nand 2\u2014burglary, a Class D felony, and theft of property valued at $500 or less, a Class A\nmisdemeanor, for events occurring on December 21, 2015, at Outdoor, Inc.; Counts 3 and\n4\u2014burglary and theft of property valued at $1000 or more but less than $10,000, a Class\nD felony, for events occurring on January 5, 2016, at Outdoor, Inc.; Counts 5 and 6\u2014\nburglary and theft of property valued at $1000 or more but less than $10,000 for events\noccurring on January 30, 2016, at Office Max; Counts 7 and 8\u2014burglary and theft of\nproperty valued at $1000 or more but less than $10,000 for events occurring on January\n30, 2016, at Best Buy; Counts 9 and 10\u2014burglary and theft of property valued at $1000\nor more but less than $10,000 for events occurring on February 19, 2016, at Best Buy;\nCounts 11, 12, and 13\u2014burglary, theft of property valued at $1000 or more but less than\n$10,000, and vandalism of property valued at $1000 or more but less than $10,000, a\nClass D felony, for events occurring on April 22, 2016, at Coffman\u2019s; and Count 14\u2014\ntheft of property valued at more than $500 but less than $1000, for events occurring on\nJune 16, 2016, at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-14-103, -105, -\n402, -408.\n\n       Pursuant to a plea agreement with the State, the Defendant sought to enter a guilty\nplea on October 31, 2016, as a Range I, standard offender, to six counts of burglary, one\ncount of vandalism, and one count of Class E felony theft, and the remaining six theft\ncounts were to be dismissed. The State proffered the following factual basis in support of\nthe Defendant\u2019s plea:\n\n              In Count 1, December the 21st of 2015, the victim was Outdoor, Inc.\n      Their alarm went off and when they arrived they discovered the glass had\n      been broken out and there had been a Yeti cooler that was taken. I believe\n      that was valued at under $500 in that matter, but it had been taken and so\n      [there was] an investigation to look into that incident. [The Defendant]\n      later admitted to his involvement . . . .\n\n             ....\n\n             Your Honor, in Count 3 it is the same victim, Outdoor, Inc. On\n      January the 5th of 2016, their alarm again went off. They thought it was a\n      mistake and so they told the alarm company not to call the police because\n      they had just closed and the owner went to the location and did discover\n      that the glass had been broken out again to gain entry into the door and that\n                                           -2-\n\fthere had been watches and GoPro cameras close to that door and that\u2019s\nwhat had been taken this time. It was valued at over $1000. . . . [The\nDefendant] did later admit that he had taken those items . . . .\n\n      ....\n\n       Count 5, if it please the [c]ourt, is January 30th of 2016. The victim\ni[s] Office Max on Stonebrook Place. . . . Again, entry was made to that\nbusiness. An alarm notified them at about 4:19 in the morning. Officers\nmade entry to discover if anybody was in there. They did not find anybody\nin there, but unlawful entry had been made and there was three memory\ncards that were taken. A printer and a case of paper had been taken. They\ndid review the video and they observed a male wearing a blue coat, dark\nblue hat and dark gloves and dark pants. That was the person that had\nentered the business on that occasion. They did not find anybody else\nthere, but the property that was taken was over the value of $1000 for\neverything that was taken. . . . [The Defendant] was later interviewed and\nhe did admit to entering Office Max and stealing the printer and the case of\npaper and the items that had been taken during the burglary. . . . [The\nDefendant] had confirmed that the printer was in his home. . . .\n\n      ....\n\n       Your Honor, may it please the [c]ourt, Count 7 is January the 30th of\n2016. The burglary victim in this matter is Best Buy on Vann Drive. They\nhad an alarm call. They responded to that alarm call while the business was\nclosed. I believe that was at about 5:25 in the morning. They responded.\nThey did find some damage to the box on the back of the building that\ncontrols the alarms. At first the manager did not think that there was\nanything that was taken. He later reviewed footage and later went through\nthe store and did discover that there was some damage to a back door and\nthat there were some items taken. A television, an Apple [i]Mac and\nanother laptop that were taken. All of that totaled more than $1000 in this\nmatter. At the time they did review the video footage to see if they could\ndetermine who this individual was. [The Defendant] was developed as a\nsuspect in this matter. He did cooperate with law enforcement . . . . They\ndid find some electronics in his home from this and he did admit to\nbreaking into Best Buy and stealing the computers and TV. . . .\n\n      ....\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f       . . . They did not have the amounts in the offense report and I\u2019m\nlooking on the victim impact statement and I believe that that was about\n$2600.\n\n       . . . If it please the [c]ourt, Count 9 is February 19th of 2016. Again,\nthe victim is Best Buy. [The Defendant] did burglarize and get into that\nbuilding and commit that burglary. . . . They reviewed video cameras once\nlaw enforcement got there and they did show an individual that was taking\ncomputers. There was about four that were taken and they totaled over\n$2000 . . . . [The Defendant] did admit that he did take those items, those\ncomputers, from Best Buy. . . .\n\n       ....\n\n       . . . [Officers] initially responded at 11:59 that night. They went\nback at 3:15 because they took in the report exactly what was stolen after\nthey discovered things were stolen. The initial one was around midnight.\nThe store was closed.\n\n       ....\n\n        . . . If i[t] please the [c]ourt, Count 11 is [April] the 22nd of 2016.\nIt\u2019s a burglary with the victim as Coffman\u2019s on the Highway 45 [B]ypass.\nOn that night, . . . I believe it was around 12:45 a.m. The Jackson Police\nDepartment responded to a burglary call at Coffman\u2019s. When they arrived,\nthey found that a large window was broken in the front of the store and that\nthere had been some furniture taken. I believe that furniture and items were\nover $6000 that were taken. . . . There was a search warrant in which items\nstolen from the Coffman\u2019s burglary were recovered from [the Defendant\u2019s]\nhome . . . .\n\n        . . . Count 13 is that he did knowingly cause damage over the value\nof $1000 to Coffman\u2019s. That is for the large window, to replace and to\nrepair that window that was damaged. . . .\n\n       ....\n\n       Your Honor, [Count 14] is actually [a] theft that [the Defendant\ncommitted] on June the 16th of 2016[,] . . . the owner being Dick\u2019s\nSporting Goods . . . . On that day the store was open and he went in at\nabout 12:41 p.m. carrying nothing but a cell phone in his hands. He picked\nup a cart and began selecting miscellaneous merchandise in the store. He\n                                      -4-\n\f       then walked up to the register and conducted a return of those items. All\n       that they would give him was a gift card for $344.62. He then\u2014that was a\n       fraudulent return. He then took that card and reentered the shopping area\n       and selected a shirt and a Yeti cooler with that gift card and then exited the\n       business with the shirt and the Yeti cooler. They are valued at over $300 . .\n       . . That was captured on video camera at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\n\nDespite the prosecutor\u2019s averments that it was customary practice in the jurisdiction to\nproceed on the burglary counts and dismiss the corresponding theft counts, the trial court\ndeclined to accept the Defendant\u2019s plea, stating that to do so was not \u201cin the interests of\njustice.\u201d\n\n      On November 7, 2016, the Defendant entered a \u201cblind plea\u201d to the indictment with\nsentencing to be determined by the trial court at a later time. The trial court accepted the\nDefendant\u2019s plea of guilty to all charges. However, no transcript of the November 7,\n2016 plea acceptance hearing is included in the record on appeal.\n\n      The Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing was held on December 20, 2016. Four\nwitnesses representing their respective businesses testified about the break-ins and the\ndamage done to their stores. Each of the four witnesses requested restitution.\n\n       Mr. George Hazelhurst from Outdoor, Inc., testified that his store was burglarized\non December 21, 2015, and again January 5, 2016, and that Yeti coolers, GoPro cameras\nand Garmin watches were stolen during the burglaries. Mr. Hazelhurst estimated that the\ntotal amount of damage done to his store \u201cwas a little over $1000\u201d and that the total value\nof the merchandise taken was \u201c[a]round $3000.\u201d Mr. Hazelhurst testified that he knew\nthe Defendant\u2019s family and that he had forgiven the Defendant. However, Mr.\nHazelhurst opined that the Defendant needed to \u201cget his act together\u201d and \u201cserve his\ntime[.]\u201d Additionally, Mr. Hazelhurst recalled that the Defendant came into the store the\nday after the first robbery \u201cand shopped and was asking\u201d about the burglary.\n\n       Mr. Ronald Noel, representing Office Max, testified that a front window was\n\u201cshattered\u201d during the burglary on January 30, 2016, and that the window cost was about\n$1200. According to Mr. Noel, a large printer worth \u201cabout $700\u201d was stolen, in addition\nto \u201c[s]ome other assorted smaller goods.\u201d\n\n        Mr. Robert Rains from Best Buy testified that the Jackson location was\nburglarized twice after hours\u2014first on January 30, 2016, and then again on February 19,\n2016. According to Mr. Rains, the Defendant \u201cpried the door open on both occasions[.]\u201d\nMr. Rains averred that, during these burglaries, the Defendant took some computers,\ntelevisions, and MacBooks. Mr. Rains valued specific stolen items\u2014an iMac computer\nat $2138, an \u201cHP Spectrum\u201d computer at $1050, a Samsung fifty-five-inch television at\n                                            -5-\n\f$1124, an ASUS computer at $644, a \u201cYoga computer\u201d at $560, and \u201ctwo Lenovo Edge\u201d\ncomputers at $1396. Mr. Rains placed the total amount of loss at $6,913.83.\n\n       According to Mr. Rains, the Defendant \u201cfirst came [in] to Best Buy\u201d last\nNovember and introduced himself, seeming \u201clike a really nice guy.\u201d In addition to\nrequesting restitution and banning the Defendant from the store, Mr. Raines also wanted\nthe Defendant to be banned from shopping online with Best Buy because the Defendant\u2019s\nfrequent returns had cost the store time and money. Moreover, according to Mr. Rains,\nthe Defendant made a false report to the police about Best Buy fraudulently keeping his\ncomputer, and the Defendant tried to steal a new computer by putting a return sticker on\nit while hiding the one he brought into the store inside an oven. Mr. Rains testified that\nthe Defendant had already been banned from Best Buy before these burglaries.\n\n       The last witness from the State was Mr. Bobby Coffman, the owner of Coffman\u2019s\nFurniture. Mr. Coffman testified that he personally responded to the alarm at his store on\nApril 22, 2016, sometime between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m. According to Mr. Coffman,\n\u201c[t]he window unit on the front of the building was broken out[,]\u201d which cost $1,091.25\nto replace. Mr. Coffman said that there was also \u201csome merchandise that was damaged\nin and around where the window was broken out[,]\u201d and he valued this damage \u201cclose to\n$4000.\u201d He then specified the damage to certain items\u2014a Tempur-Pedic mattress that\nwas later recovered, but because they were unable by law to resell the mattress, Mr.\nCoffman valued the loss for the mattress at $1665; a \u201cBig Green Egg\u201d grill that had been\n\u201cflipped over and broken in an attempt to carry it out of the store[,]\u201d which Mr. Coffman\nvalued at $740; a damaged chair worth $469; and a damaged rug worth $279.\n\n       When asked what items were stolen from the business, Mr. Coffman stated that \u201cit\nwas about [fourteen] items all together\u201d\u2014\u201c[f]urniture items, accent chest, oil painting,\nrug, [and] miscellaneous accessory items.\u201d Mr. Coffman valued these items at\napproximately $5200. Furthermore, Mr. Coffman confirmed that several of the stolen\nitems were large and would have likely taken more than one person to remove them from\nthe store.\n\n       According to Mr. Coffman, they were able to recover the stolen items, selling\n\u201c[m]ost of those items . . . at a significant discount\u201d or giving them to charity. Mr.\nCoffman confirmed that he filed an insurance claim for \u201caround $4400\u201d and that he\n\u201crecovered between $1900 and $2000\u201d from the insurance company, after paying his\ndeductible of $2500. He confirmed that the insurance claim covered the damage and\nstolen items and the store window unit.\n\n     Mr. Coffman stated that he knew the Defendant\u2019s family, although he did not\nknow the Defendant personally. Mr. Coffman relayed that the Defendant came into\nCoffman\u2019s the day before the burglary and \u201cspent a significant amount of time going\n                                           -6-\n\faround [the] store making notes and taking pictures of different items and so forth.\u201d\nFurthermore, according to Mr. Coffman, the Defendant came into the store the day after\nthe burglary and talked with some of the sales people. He conveyed that some of the\nsales people knew the Defendant and that they were afraid when they found \u201cout what\nhad happened and knowing that he had been in the store twice before and after.\u201d Also,\naccording to Mr. Coffman, \u201cIt put our family under a lot of duress just dealing with all of\nthis as well.\u201d\n\n       The State did not present a witness from Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. The presentence\nreport was entered into evidence and was accompanied by victim impact statements from\nOutdoor Inc., Best Buy, and Coffman\u2019s. The Defendant only had one speeding ticket on\nhis record at the time of the sentencing hearing.\n\n       The Defendant presented testimony from Dr. Lynn Zager, an expert in\n\u201cpsychological evaluation/forensic psychological evaluation.\u201d Dr. Zager evaluated the\nDefendant and diagnosed him with a \u201cmood disorder, not otherwise specified, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, benzodiazepine use disorder, [and] antisocial personality\ndisorder.\u201d\n\n      With regard to the Defendant\u2019s mood disorder, Dr. Zager stated that depression\nwas a \u201csignificant issue\u201d for the Defendant and noted that the Defendant had received\ntreatment for depression in the past. However, the Defendant\u2019s taking of medication\nhindered Dr. Zager\u2019s ability to make a more specific diagnosis.\n\n       Additionally, Dr. Zager believed that post-traumatic stress disorder was also a\n\u201cvery significant\u201d issue for the Defendant because he had suffered \u201ctwo very serious\ntraumas[.]\u201d First, the Defendant was a manager at a bowling alley where he witnessed a\nshooting. The person attempted to shoot the Defendant, but the \u201cgun misfired.\u201d The\nDefendant claimed that he had a gun himself \u201cbut elected not shoot at the perpetrator\nbecause there were so many innocent people around[.]\u201d The Defendant used his car to\nblock the perpetrator in until the police arrived. A person died, and the Defendant \u201cwas\ninvolved with the cleanup[.]\u201d The Defendant also had to testify in court, which \u201cwas a\ncontinuation of the trauma\u201d for him by causing \u201cvery significant anxiety[.]\u201d1 The second\nincident occurred \u201con a very isolated[,] deserted road\u201d in California. The Defendant was\ndriving when \u201che came upon a person l[]ying in the middle of the street\u201d due to a car\naccident. He stopped to assist the person in the street who was still alive and waited for\n\n1\n  We agree with the State that this recount of the Defendant\u2019s differs markedly from his trial testimony.\nSee State v. Ledarren S. Hawkins, No. W2010-01687-CCA-R3-CD, 2012 WL 543048, at *2 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Feb. 16, 2012), rev\u2019d in part, 403 S.W.3d 121 (Tenn. 2013). There, the Defendant testified that he\n\u201cdid not see anything related to this incident firsthand\u201d and that, while he \u201cstopped the vehicle, . . . he\nallowed the vehicle to leave the parking lot because he could not determine the occupants\u2019 involvement.\u201d\n                                                   -7-\n\fthe first responders to arrive. However, \u201capparently there was another person in one of\nthe cars who was still alive unbeknownst to him or the first responders[,] and [the\nDefendant] heard that last breath as that person expired.\u201d According to Dr. Zager, the\nDefendant had never received needed treatment for \u201cthose traumas[,]\u201d which would have\nincluded medication and counseling.\n\n      Dr. Zager relayed that the Defendant also had \u201can antisocial personality disorder.\u201d\nHowever, Dr. Zager relayed that antisocial personality disorder was not treatable with\nmedication and was, on the whole, \u201cmuch more challenging to treat[.]\u201d\n\n      Dr. Zager testified about the Defendant\u2019s substance abuse issues. Dr. Zager\nconfirmed that the Defendant had received in-patient \u201csubstance abuse rehabilitation\u201d in\nJuly 2015, which was prior to his commission of any of these offenses. However,\naccording to Dr. Zager, this treatment addressed the Defendant\u2019s substance issues but not\n\u201cthe mental health issues at all.\u201d\n\n        Dr. Zager agreed that the Defendant was competent but concluded that the\nDefendant \u201cwas suffering from a mental illness at the time the offenses occurred.\u201d The\nfact that the Defendant was taking Ambien at the time \u201cof some of\u201d these burglaries was\n\u201c[a]nother complicating issue[,]\u201d in Dr. Zager\u2019s opinion. According to Dr. Zager,\nAmbien could have caused a \u201cdissociative-type reaction\u201d; a reaction that was also\ncommon with post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr. Zager described a dissociative state:\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s almost like they take a step out of their body and they are observing what\u2019s\nhappening, but not experiencing it[.]\u201d\n\n       According to Dr. Zager, the Defendant expressed \u201clegitimate\u201d remorse for his\ncrimes. She recommended \u201clong-term outpatient counselling\u201d for the Defendant, which\nshe did not think he could get if incarcerated. However, she agreed that the Defendant\u2019s\nincarceration so far had helped him to become \u201cmotivated to change[.]\u201d\n\n        Dr. Zager\u2019s report was admitted into evidence. In the report, Dr. Zager concluded\nthat, although the Defendant suffered from mental illnesses, \u201chis capacity to appreciate\nthe nature and wrongfulness of his behavior at the times of the alleged offenses was not\nsignificantly [impaired.]\u201d Moreover, it was noted that the Defendant had returned to\nusing drugs prior to his incarceration for these crimes.\n\n        The thirty-one-year-old Defendant made a statement in allocution. The\nDefendant apologized to all those \u201caffected by [his] poor decisions\u201d and stated that he\n\u201cdeeply regret[ted]\u201d his actions. The Defendant claimed that \u201c[t]he entire experience\nha[d] heavily worn\u201d on him and had been \u201cespecially difficult for [his] family and loved\nones.\u201d According to the Defendant, while incarcerated, he was \u201cconfronted by the\npainful truth that [he] ha[d] been living a horrible life full of lies and deception.\u201d He\n                                           -8-\n\fstated that, although he was \u201cat rock bottom,\u201d he had maintained his faith in God and\nwanted to strive for \u201ca life of integrity and honesty[.]\u201d The Defendant asked \u201cfor mercy\nand understanding[,]\u201d claiming that he would never \u201cdo this or anything that would\njeopardize [his] freedom again.\u201d According to the Defendant, he wished \u201cto rehabilitate\n[him]self in joint programs[,]\u201d including participation in Celebrate Recovery. He\nrecognized that his \u201cactions ha[d] caused [him] to lose so many precious moments that\n[he would] never be able to get back[,]\u201d like missing family events. Furthermore, he\nstated that he already lost his car and was about to lose his house as well.\n\n       After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the evidence and sentencing\nconsiderations, the trial court classified the Defendant as a Range I, standard offender.\nThe trial court also found five enhancement factors applicable. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\n40-35-114.\n\n       First, the trial court, noting the Defendant\u2019s substance abuse problem, found that\nthe Defendant had a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior in\naddition to those necessary to establish the appropriate range. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-\n35-114(1). However, the trial court chose to give this factor \u201cvery slight weight.\u201d\n\n        Second, the trial court determined that the Defendant was a leader in the\ncommission of the offense at Coffman\u2019s. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(2).\nAccording to the trial court, the Defendant gave a police statement wherein \u201che made\nreferences to other people that were involved with him when he broke into Coffman\u2019s[.]\u201d\nThe trial court also noted Mr. Coffman\u2019s testimony that there were several large items\ntaken from the store, which would have required assistance to move. The trial court said\nthat it would apply \u201cgreat weight\u201d to this factor when considering the counts of the\nindictment that named Coffman\u2019s as the victim.\n\n       Third, the trial court found that the offenses involved more than one victim but\nstated that this factor was not given \u201cmuch enhancement weight[.]\u201d See Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-114(3). The trial court reasoned, \u201c[H]e is being convicted and being\nsentenced on at least [fourteen] counts involving at least seven different victims. You\nknow, this really involves seven separate criminal episodes over the period of about five\nmonths.\u201d\n\n      Next, the trial court stated that it would apply the factor \u201c[t]hat the amount of\ndamage to property sustained [by] or taken from the victims was particularly great[.]\u201d\nSee Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(6). In giving this factor \u201cgreat weight,\u201d the trial court\nremarked that it had heard testimony from \u201crepresentatives from these various businesses\nabout what property was taken [and] what damage was done to their business.\u201d\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f       Regarding the December 21, 2015 events at Outdoor, Inc., the trial court observed\nthat the Defendant broke a window and stole a Yeti cooler; that the Defendant went in to\nthe store the day after the robbery and spoke with Mr. Hazelhurst \u201cabout the break-in and\nabout what had happened\u201d; and that the break-in diverted the business\u2019s valuable time\naway from other tasks during the holiday season, \u201cthe busiest shopping period of the\nyear[.]\u201d The trial court then mentioned that, two weeks later on January 5, 2016, the\nDefendant broke the same window at Outdoor, Inc., which had since been replaced; that,\nduring this incident, the Defendant stole about $3000 of property; and that, in response,\nthe business \u201cput up security bars and tr[ied] to make other efforts to keep people from\nbreaking into their business.\u201d The trial court surmised that Outdoor, Inc. had \u201csuffered a\ntremendous loss of property.\u201d\n\n       According to the trial court, the same was true for Office Max\u2014that business\nhaving its window \u201csmashed out\u201d on January 30, 2016, and items valued at over $1000\ntaken from the store. The trial court further remarked that the cost to repair the window\nwas $1200.\n\n        The trial court next observed that Best Buy had \u201csuffered two break-ins,\u201d one on\nJanuary 30, 2016, and the other on February 19, 2016, and that \u201c[a] lot of valuable items .\n. . were taken from that business.\u201d According to the trial court, Best Buy\u2019s loss from\nthese two incidents totaled around $9000. The trial court then noted that Mr. Rains\ntestified that, prior to the burglaries, the Defendant had already been banned from Best\nBuy.\n\n       As for the events occurring at Coffman\u2019s on April 22, 2016, the trial court stated\nthat \u201ca large window was knocked out valued at over $1000\u201d; that \u201c[a]bout $5200 of\nitems were stolen from [this] business\u201d; and that there was \u201c[a]proximately another\n$4000 worth of merchandise [that] was damaged as a result of the break-in[.]\u201d\n\n       The trial court, after relaying the facts of each break-in, stated that it was\naccrediting the testimony of Mr. Coffman, Mr. Hazelhurst, and Mr. Rains that they knew\nof the Defendant and that he had been inside their stores. The trial court opined that,\nbased upon the Defendant\u2019s actions, such as taking pictures at Coffman\u2019s, he appeared to\nbe \u201ccasing out the businesses[.]\u201d\n\n       As its final enhancement factor, the trial court considered that, at the time the\nDefendant committed the Class E felony on June 16, 2016, he was released on bond. See\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(13)(A). According to the trial court, the Defendant had\nbeen arrested for the six prior burglaries and released on bond on May 15, 2016. It was\nonly a month later that the Defendant stole from Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. The trial court\nsaid that it was giving this factor \u201cgreat weight for enhancement purposes.\u201d\n\n                                           -10-\n\f        The trial court then discussed the Defendant\u2019s evidence presented in mitigation,\nrelaying that it had reviewed the presentence report and considered all of the testimony\npresented at the hearing. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-113. The trial court first\nobserved that the Defendant had made an allocution statement, wherein he \u201cexpress[ed]\nsome remorse for his actions.\u201d The trial court then noted that the Defendant had suffered\nfrom substance abuse in the past, that he had received treatment \u201cseveral months prior to\ncommitting all of these offenses[,]\u201d and that, while \u201cit helped him at first,\u201d \u201cthen he did\nnot take into consideration the consequences.\u201d The trial court opined that, \u201cfor whatever\nreason[, drug treatment] certainly ha[d]n\u2019t helped [the Defendant] change his behavior[.]\u201d\nThe trial court also referenced the Defendant\u2019s employment history\u2014remarking that the\nDefendant had worked at Forever Communications \u201cfor a short period of time[,]\u201d and\nlater at Carlock Nissan for about four months, and then at AFLAC for \u201cabout nine\nmonths during the time period that he committed these offenses.\u201d The trial court\nobserved that the Defendant \u201cwas actually working making some [money] during the\ntime that he [was] out [t]here breaking into all of those businesses and stealing all of\nth[eir] property.\u201d After reviewing the mitigation evidence, the trial court concluded that\nit did not \u201csee anything . . . that [it] would consider mitigating on the [D]efendant\u2019s\nbehalf.\u201d\n\n       Before imposing the length of each sentence, the trial court made one more\nobservation\u2014that the Defendant was not \u201csomeone that\u2019s lacking for money.\u201d Citing to\nthe presentence report, the trial court noted that the Defendant had a home valued at\nabout $160,000, had an \u201cinterest in a business called Andy Kim Skating, LP, with an\nunknown amount of equity[,]\u201d had two different bank accounts with \u201ca combined balance\nof $4200 plus the salary that he was earning through his job at AFLAC[,]\u201d and was\nleasing a vehicle valued at about $38,000. The trial court surmised, \u201c[T]here is really no\nreason he would go out and commit all of these other than just to make more money, I\nguess.\u201d\n\n       After considering the enhancement and mitigating factors, the trial court sentenced\nthe Defendant to three years for each of the twelve Class D felonies, which included\nburglary, theft of property valued at $1000 or more but less than $10,000, and vandalism\nof property valued at $1000 or more but less than $10,000 (Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n10, 11, 12, and 13); two years for the one count of Class E felony theft (Count 14); and\neleven-months and twenty-nine days for the one count of Class A misdemeanor theft\n(Count 2). The trial court also ordered restitution in the amount of $4000 to Outdoor,\nInc., $1900 to Office Max, $7,913.83 to Best Buy, and $3000 to Coffman\u2019s. The trial\ncourt additionally ordered a $1000 fine for each of the fourteen counts, the Defendant to\npay court costs, the Defendant to submit to DNA testing, and the Defendant to have no\ncontact with any of these businesses in the future, including Best Buy online.\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f        The trial court then addressed the Defendant\u2019s request for alternative sentencing.\nThe trial court said that it did not accredit Dr. Zager\u2019s testimony \u201cat all\u201d and,\nconsequently, it did not believe that the Defendant was \u201csuffering from any type of\nmental health disorder.\u201d The trial court noted that the Defendant\u2019s crimes \u201crequired a lot\nof planning\u201d because the Defendant \u201cwas going out to these businesses, visiting these\nbusinesses, scoping out what property he perhaps wanted to take[,]\u201d and then going back\nlater and breaking into these businesses when they were closed. The trial court likewise\ndid not believe that the Defendant was suffering from any physical condition.\n\n       Deliberating on the circumstances surrounding these offenses, the trial court stated\nthat \u201cthe totality of all of this criminal activity, it [was] very extensive.\u201d The trial court\nremarked that there were seven separate victims over a five-month time period, that\n\u201c[t]hese [were] large thefts[,]\u201d that the victims asked for imprisonment wanting the\nDefendant to be held accountable for his actions, and that the victims\u2019 had used both time\nand monetary expenditures \u201cto deal with this.\u201d\n\n        The trial court found that the Defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation was \u201cvery\npoor,\u201d giving \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the fact that the Defendant was on bond when he\ncommitted the theft at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. The trial court reasoned that the\nDefendant gave \u201ca full confession\u201d upon his arrest for these six burglaries, that he was\nreleased on a $50,000 bond, but that, \u201ca month later[,] he [was] out doing the same thing\nagain[.]\u201d In addition, the trial court remarked that the Defendant had not \u201cmade any\neffort to try to rehabilitate himself.\u201d\n\n       According to the trial court, the \u201cinterests of society in being protected from this\ndefendant\u2019s criminal conduct in the future [was] great.\u201d In this regard, the trial court\nmaintained that \u201c[w]e have to protect our businesses\u201d and \u201cto protect these owners who\nhave to suffer from thieves who want to break in and steal.\u201d The trial court also\ndetermined that \u201cconfinement [was] particularly suited to provide an effective deterrent\nto others who [were] likely to commit similar offenses,\u201d noting again the extensive\nmeasures businesses had to take to deal with thieves and to protect their property. The\ntrial court concluded that the Defendant was \u201cnot a good candidate for alternative\nsentencing\u201d \u201cbased upon the extensive activity, the extensive criminal activity that he\ncommitted over a five-month period.\u201d\n\n        Finally, the trial court addressed the imposition of consecutive sentencing, stating\ninitially that Count 14 involving Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods was, by law, mandatorily\nconsecutive to the other counts because the Defendant \u201cwas out on bond when he\ncommitted that theft.\u201d The trial court stated that it was \u201clook[ing] at the overall activity\nof this defendant[,]\u201d and found that discretionary consecutive sentencing was also\nappropriate \u201cto protect society from this defendant\u2019s unwillingness to lead a productive\nlife and the [D]efendant\u2019s resort to criminal activity in furtherance of [an] anti-societal\n                                            -12-\n\flifestyle.\u201d Stated another way, \u201cI\u2019m thinking why would this young man[,] who basically\nhas a good financial living situation[,] go[] out and just start[] committing these various\ncrimes[,] . . . other than he just wants to resort to criminal activity as part of his lifestyle.\u201d\nThe trial court further determined that the aggregate length of the sentence was\nreasonably related to \u201cthe [fourteen] different offenses for which [the Defendant] st[ood]\nconvicted.\u201d\n\n        In fashioning the Defendant\u2019s sentence, the trial court aligned the sentences related\nto each victim concurrently, while aligning the aggregated sentences for each victim\nconsecutively to one another. Specifically, an aggregate three-year sentence was\nimposed for Counts 1 through 4 relating to Outdoor, Inc.; an aggregate three-year\nsentence was imposed for Counts 5 through 6 relating to Office Max; an aggregate three-\nyear sentence was imposed for Counts 7 through 10 relating to Best Buy; an aggregate\nthree-year sentence was imposed for Counts 11 through 13 relating to Coffman\u2019s; and a\ntwo-year sentence for the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods theft in Count 14. These sets of\noffenses as they related to each victim were to be served consecutively to one another,\nresulting in a total effective sentence of fourteen years in the Department of Correction.\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n       On appeal, the Defendant contends that the trial court improperly sentenced him to\nfull confinement on Count 14 because Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-122\nprohibits continuous confinement for a non-violent property offense. The Defendant also\nargues that the trial court erred regarding the length of his various sentences, the denial of\nany form of alternative sentencing, and the imposition of partially consecutive\nsentencing. The State concedes error on Count 14 but submits that the trial court\u2019s\nsentencing decision should be affirmed in all other respects.\n\n                                     I. Standard of Review\n\n        Before a trial court imposes a sentence upon a convicted criminal defendant, it\nmust consider: (a) the evidence adduced at the trial and the sentencing hearing; (b) the\npresentence report; (c) the principles of sentencing and arguments as to sentencing\nalternatives; (d) the nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct involved; (e)\nevidence and information offered by the parties on the enhancement and mitigating\nfactors set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated sections 40-35-113 and 40-35-114; (f) any\nstatistical information provided by the Administrative Office of the Courts as to\nTennessee sentencing practices for similar offenses; and (g) any statement the defendant\nwishes to make in the defendant\u2019s own behalf about sentencing. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-\n35-210(b). When an accused challenges the length and manner of service of a sentence,\nthis court reviews the trial court\u2019s sentencing determination under an abuse of discretion\nstandard accompanied by a presumption of reasonableness. State v. Bise, 380 S.W.3d\n                                              -13-\n\f682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). This standard of review also applies to \u201cthe questions related to\nprobation or any other alternative sentence,\u201d see State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 278-79\n(Tenn. 2012), and also to consecutive sentencing determinations, see State v. Pollard, 432\nS.W.3d 851, 860-61 (Tenn. 2013). The burden of showing that a sentence is improper is\nupon the appealing party. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-401, Sentencing Comm\u2019n\nCmts.; see also State v. Arnett, 49 S.W.3d 250, 257 (Tenn. 2001).\n\n       This court will uphold the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision \u201cso long as it is within\nthe appropriate range and the record demonstrates that the sentence is otherwise in\ncompliance with the purposes and principles listed by statute.\u201d Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 709-\n10. Moreover, under such circumstances, appellate courts may not disturb the sentence\neven if we had preferred a different result. See State v. Carter, 254 S.W.3d 335, 346\n(Tenn. 2008). Those purposes and principles include \u201cthe imposition of a sentence justly\ndeserved in relation to the seriousness of the offense,\u201d Tennessee Code Annotated section\n40-35-102(1), a punishment sufficient \u201cto prevent crime and promote respect for the\nlaw,\u201d Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-102(3), and consideration of a\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cpotential or lack of potential for . . . rehabilitation,\u201d Tennessee Code\nAnnotated section 40-35-103(5). Carter, 254 S.W.3d at 344. Ultimately, in sentencing a\ndefendant, a trial court should impose a sentence that is \u201cno greater than that deserved for\nthe offense committed\u201d and is \u201cthe least severe measure necessary to achieve the\npurposes for which the sentence is imposed.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-103(2) & (4).\n\n         II. Length of Terms, Alternative Sentencing, and Consecutive Sentencing\n\n      The Defendant contends that the court erred in setting the length of his sentences,\nin denying all forms of alternative sentencing, and in imposing partially consecutive\nsentences. The State responds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the\nDefendant\u2019s sentences, other than Count 14, should be upheld.2\n\n                                        A. Sentence Length\n\n       The Defendant contends that the trial court improperly applied enhancement\nfactors (2) and (3) in fashioning the Defendant\u2019s sentence. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-\n35-114(2) & (3). He makes no challenge to any of the other three enhancement factors\napplied by the trial court.\n\n       The weight to be afforded an enhancement or mitigating factor is left to the trial\ncourt\u2019s discretion so long as its use complies with the purposes and principles of the 1989\n\n2\n  Although the appellate record does not include a copy of the November 7, 2016 guilty plea transcript,\nwe deem the record, which does include the October 31, 2016 transcript and a verbatim recitation of the\nfacts supporting each count, sufficient for this court to conduct a meaningful review.\n                                                 -14-\n\fSentencing Act and the court\u2019s findings are adequately supported by the record. Tenn.\nCode Ann. \u00a7 40-35-210(d)-(f); Carter, 254 S.W.3d at 342-43. Moreover, no longer does\nmisapplication of an enhancement or mitigating factor \u201cinvalidate the sentence imposed\nunless the trial court wholly departed from the 1989 Act, as amended in 2005.\u201d Bise, 380\nS.W.3d at 706. Accordingly, this court will uphold the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision\n\u201cso long as it is within the appropriate range and the record demonstrates that the\nsentence is otherwise in compliance with the purposes and principles listed by statute.\u201d\nId. at 709-10.\n\n        Regarding enhancement factor (2)\u2014that the defendant was a leader in the\ncommission of an offense, the trial court gave this factor \u201cgreat weight\u201d in the counts\nnaming Coffman\u2019s as the victim, i.e., Counts 11, 12, and 13. The Defendant cites to\nState v. Randell Murphy, for the proposition that, even if others were involved, \u201cthere\nwas no proof, either during the guilty plea submission hearing or the sentencing hearing,\nto establish that the defendant had a leadership role in the offenses.\u201d No. W2011-00744-\nCCA-R3-CD, 2012 WL 1656735, at *10 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 9, 2012). The trial\ncourt, in its ruling, noted that the Defendant, in his statement to police, apparently \u201cmade\nreferences to other people that were involved with him when he broke into Coffman\u2019s\nand stole some large items.\u201d Mr. Coffman also testified that, due to the size of several of\nthe stolen items, it would be unlikely that someone could have removed those alone\nwithout assistance. Moreover, from Mr. Coffman\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing,\nit appeared as though the Defendant was \u201ccasing out\u201d Coffman\u2019s the day before the\nburglary \u201cmaking notes and taking pictures of different items and so forth.\u201d The\nDefendant also came into the store the day after the burglary. We conclude that the\nrecord supports application of enhancement factor (2) to the Coffman\u2019s counts of the\nindictment.\n\n        Regarding enhancement factor (3)\u2014that the offenses involved more than one\nvictim, the trial court applied this factor but stated that this factor was not given \u201cmuch\nenhancement weight[.]\u201d In applying this factor, the trial court reasoned, \u201c[H]e is being\nconvicted and being sentenced on at least [fourteen] counts involving at least seven\ndifferent victims. You know, this really involves seven separate criminal episodes over\nthe period of about five months.\u201d The Defendant cites to State v. Imfeld in support of his\nargument that enhancement factor (3) is inapplicable when a defendant is convicted of\nseparate offenses as to each victim. 70 S.W.3d 698, 705-06 (Tenn. 2002). Our supreme\ncourt has said that this enhancement factor may be applied only to an offense involving\nmore than one victim, not to offenses in which there is a specific, named victim. Id. In\nthe present case, the indictment named each of the five businesses as a victim of the\ncharged offenses. While the trial court erred in applying this enhancement factor, the\ntrial court also did not give it \u201cmuch enhancement weight.\u201d\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f       The Defendant also submits that the trial court failed to properly consider Dr.\nZager\u2019s testimony in mitigation. According to the Defendant, Dr. Zager\u2019s testimony\nsupports application of mitigating factors (8) and (13). See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-\n113(8) (\u201cThe defendant was suffering from a mental or physical condition that\nsignificantly reduced the defendant\u2019s culpability for the offense[.]\u201d) & (13) (\u201cAny other\nfactor consistent with the purposes of this chapter.\u201d). The Defendant notes that Dr.\nZager\u2019s testimony \u201cwas uncontroverted by any other testimony\u201d and submits that he\nshould be allowed to receive needed \u201crehabilitative mental health treatment.\u201d\n\n       In examining the Defendant\u2019s mitigation evidence, the trial court discussed the\nDefendant\u2019s history of substance abuse, noting that the Defendant had received drug\ntreatment prior to the commission of these offenses and had returned to using drugs. The\ntrial court also reviewed the Defendant\u2019s employment history, observing that the\nDefendant \u201cwas actually working making some[ money] during the time\u201d he burglarized\nthese businesses and that he was not a person \u201clacking for money.\u201d The trial court\nconcluded that it did not \u201csee anything . . . that [it] would consider mitigating on the\n[D]efendant\u2019s behalf.\u201d Later in its ruling, the trial court stated that it did not accredit Dr.\nZager\u2019s testimony \u201cat all\u201d and, consequently, it did not believe that the Defendant was\n\u201csuffering from any type of mental health disorder.\u201d\n\n        The trial court heard Dr. Zager\u2019s live testimony at the sentencing hearing and was\nin the best position to assess credibility. See Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 709 n.43. The record\ndoes not preponderate against the trial court\u2019s credibility determination. Moreover, the\ntrial court aptly observed that the Defendant\u2019s crimes \u201ctook a lot of planning[.]\u201d In the\nreport, Dr. Zager concluded that, although the Defendant suffered from mental illnesses,\n\u201chis capacity to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of his behavior at the times of the\nalleged offenses was not significantly [impaired.]\u201d In addition, the Defendant\u2019s version\nof the two incidents of trauma he suffered, as recounted by Dr. Zager, can only be\ncategorized outlandish.\n\n        Again, a trial court\u2019s erroneous consideration of some enhancement or mitigating\nfactors, which are merely advisory, does not give this court grounds for reversal when the\ntrial court otherwise conforms with the mandates of the Sentencing Act. See Bise, 380\nS.W.3d at 709-10; Carter, 254 S.W.3d at 346. Most importantly, the Defendant makes no\nargument that any of the other three enhancement factors were improperly applied to\nhim\u2014that the Defendant had a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal\nbehavior in addition to those necessary to establish the appropriate range; that the amount\nof damage to property sustained by or taken from the victims was particularly great; or\nthat at the time the Defendant was on bond when he committed the Class E felony theft.\nSee Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(1), (6) & (13)(A). The record demonstrates that the\ntrial court sentenced the Defendant in accordance with our Sentencing Act. Accordingly,\n\n                                             -16-\n\fwe cannot say that the Defendant has established that the trial court abused its discretion\nby enhancing the lengths of his sentences, and he is, therefore, not entitled to relief. See,\ne.g., State v. Joshua Iceman, No. M2016-00975-CCA-R3-CD, 2017 WL 4805118, at *32\n(Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 24, 2017), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Feb. 14, 2018); State v.\nRichard Dickerson, No. W2012-02283-CCA-R3-CD, 2014 WL 1102003, at *12 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Mar. 19, 2014) (both cases concluding that the trial court improperly\nconsidered two of three enhancement factors it applied but, nonetheless, otherwise\nconformed with the mandates of the Sentencing Act, so the defendant was not entitled to\nrelief).\n\n                                         B. Alternative Sentencing\n\n       Relative to the trial court\u2019s denial of alternative sentencing, the Defendant\ncontends that \u201cthe trial court erred by sentencing [him] to a period of confinement rather\nthan by less restrictive means.\u201d The Defendant asserts that, although the trial court\nmentioned his prior substance abuse, it \u201ccompletely disregarded the testimony and report\nof\u201d Dr. Zager, thus, failing \u201cto adequately take into account [his] potential and need for\nrehabilitative measures.\u201d The Defendant also notes that he is a favorable candidate for\nalternative sentencing.\n\n       The Defendant was convicted of twelve Class D felonies and a Class A\nmisdemeanor.3 Therefore, he was to be \u201cconsidered as a favorable candidate for\nalternative sentencing options in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-102(6). However, no longer is any defendant entitled to a presumption that\nhe or she is a favorable candidate for alternative sentencing. Carter, 254 S.W.3d at 347.\nTennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-102(6) is now only advisory. See Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-102(6)(D). A trial court should consider the following when determining\nany defendant\u2019s suitability for alternative sentencing:\n\n          (A) Confinement is necessary to protect society by restraining a defendant\n          who has a long history of criminal conduct;\n\n          (B) Confinement is necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of the\n          offense or confinement is particularly suited to provide an effective\n          deterrence to others likely to commit similar offenses; or\n\n          (C) Measures less restrictive than confinement have frequently or recently\n          been applied unsuccessfully to the defendant[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-103(1)(A)-(C).\n\n3\n    We will discuss alternative sentencing options for the Class E felony theft, Count 14, separately.\n                                                      -17-\n\f       In denying alternative sentencing, the trial court stated that it did not find Dr.\nZager\u2019s testimony credible and did not believe that the Defendant was \u201csuffering from\nany type of mental health disorder.\u201d As stated above, the record does not preponderate\nagainst that finding. The trial court also commented on the circumstances surrounding\nthe offenses, noting that \u201cthe totality of all of this criminal activity\u201d was very extensive,\ninvolving seven separate victims over a five-month time period. The court further noted\nthat \u201c[t]hese [were] large thefts\u201d causing the businesses to use both time and monetary\nexpenditures. The trial court also found that the Defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation\nwas poor, giving \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the fact that the Defendant was on a $50,000 bond\nwhen he committed the theft at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Moreover, society \u201cgreat[ly]\u201d\nneeded to be protected \u201cfrom this defendant\u2019s criminal conduct in the future[.]\u201d The trial\ncourt also determined that \u201cconfinement [was] particularly suited to provide an effective\ndeterrent to others who are likely to commit similar offenses,\u201d noting the extensive\nmeasures businesses had to take to deal with thieves and to protect their property. The\ntrial court properly considered the sentencing principles in its alternative sentencing\ndecision. Accordingly, the Defendant has failed to establish an abuse of discretion or\notherwise overcome the presumption of reasonableness in this regard.\n\n                                 C. Consecutive Sentences\n\n        The Defendant also contends that trial court erred in ordering partially consecutive\nsentencing. Specifically, the Defendant requests \u201cthis court consider that no one suffered\nbodily injury in these burglaries of businesses\u201d and that \u201c[n]o habitations were intruded\nupon.\u201d He further notes that he \u201cis capable of making restitution if allowed to work and\nattempt to maintain employment\u201d and that he \u201cis willing and able to seek rehabilitation\nfor his mental health issues.\u201d\n\n        Our supreme court has held that \u201cthe abuse of discretion standard, accompanied by\na presumption of reasonableness, applies to consecutive sentencing determinations\u201d \u201cif\n[the trial court] has provided reasons on the record establishing at least one of the seven\ngrounds listed in Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b)[.]\u201d Pollard, 432\nS.W.3d at 860-61. Further, \u201c[s]o long as a trial court properly articulates reasons for\nordering consecutive sentences, thereby providing a basis for meaningful appellate\nreview, the sentences will be presumed reasonable and, absent an abuse of discretion,\nupheld on appeal.\u201d Id. at 862 (citing Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1)) (\u201cThe order [for\nconsecutive sentences] shall specify the reasons for this decision and is reviewable on\nappeal.\u201d).\n\n      Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b) provides that a trial court should\nconsider the following criteria in determining whether to impose consecutive sentencing:\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\f             (1) The defendant is a professional criminal who has knowingly\n       devoted the defendant\u2019s life to criminal acts as a major source of livelihood;\n\n              (2) The defendant is an offender whose record of criminal activity is\n       extensive;\n\n              (3) The defendant is a dangerous mentally abnormal person so\n       declared by a competent psychiatrist who concludes as a result of an\n       investigation prior to sentencing that the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct has\n       been characterized by a pattern of repetitive or compulsive behavior with\n       heedless indifference to consequences;\n\n               (4) The defendant is a dangerous offender whose behavior indicates\n       little or no regard for human life and no hesitation about committing a\n       crime in which the risk to human life is high;\n\n              (5) The defendant is convicted of two (2) or more statutory offenses\n       involving sexual abuse of a minor with consideration of the aggravating\n       circumstances arising from the relationship between the defendant and\n       victim or victims, the time span of defendant\u2019s undetected sexual activity,\n       the nature and scope of the sexual acts and the extent of the residual,\n       physical and mental damage to the victim or victims;\n\n              (6) The defendant is sentenced for an offense committed while on\n       probation; or\n\n              (7) The defendant is sentenced for criminal contempt.\n\nThe trial court may impose consecutive sentencing upon finding the existence of any one\nof the criteria contained in Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b).\n\n       In the instant case, the trial court first determined that consecutive sentencing was\nrequired by law with respect to the conviction for theft from Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods,\nCount 14, because the Defendant committed the offense while he was released on bond\nfor the other offenses. This is a correct statement of the law regarding mandatory\nconsecutive sentencing. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-20-111(b) (stating that consecutive\nsentencing is mandatory for offenses committed while a defendant is released on bail,\nprovided the defendant is convicted of both offenses); Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(C)\n(requiring consecutive sentencing where \u201cthe defendant was released on bail and the\ndefendant is convicted of both offenses\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\f        In imposing discretionary consecutive sentencing on the other thirteen counts, the\ntrial court stated that it was \u201clook[ing] at the overall activity of this defendant[,]\u201d\nbelieving that consecutive sentencing was necessary \u201cto protect society from this\ndefendant\u2019s unwillingness to lead a productive life and the [D]efendant\u2019s resort to\ncriminal activity in furtherance of [an] anti-societal lifestyle.\u201d According to the trial\ncourt, the Defendant \u201cjust want[ed] to resort to criminal activity as part of his lifestyle.\u201d\nThe trial court also concluded that the aggregate length of the sentences was reasonably\nrelated to \u201cthe [fourteen] different offenses for which [the Defendant] st[ood] convicted.\u201d\n\n       Despite having no prior criminal record other than a speeding ticket, the\nDefendant was convicted of fourteen crimes, including thirteen felonies, for his crime\nspree that spanned a five-month period. There were seven different incidents, and five\nseparate businesses were burglarized. While the trial court did not identify with\nparticularity which of the consecutive sentencing criterion it was relying upon, the record\nsupports the imposition of consecutive sentencing based upon a finding that the\nDefendant \u201cis an offender whose record of criminal activity is extensive.\u201d See Tenn.\nCode Ann. 40-35-115(b)(2).\n\n        This court has held that current offenses may be used in determining whether a\ndefendant\u2019s record of criminal activity is extensive for the purposes of consecutive\nsentencing. See State v. Cummings, 868 S.W.2d 661, 667 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992);\nState v. Carolyn J. Nobles, No. M2006-00695-CCA-R3-CD, 2007 WL 677861, at *12\n(Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 7, 2007); State v. Bobby Blair, No. M2002-02376-CCA-R3-CD,\n2003 WL 22888924, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 5, 2003) (\u201c[T]his court has held that\n[Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35]-115(b)(2) applies to both the extensive nature\nof the defendant\u2019s present convictions and the defendant\u2019s history of criminal activity.\u201d)\n(citing State v. Palmer, 10 S.W.3d 638, 648-49 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999)). Accordingly,\nwe cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing partially\nconsecutive sentences. See, e.g., Cummings, 868 S.W.2d at 667 (upholding the\nimposition of consecutive sentencing for a defendant who was convicted of eight crimes\nin a single trial based on the fact that the defendant\u2019s record of criminal activity was\nextensive even though he had no prior criminal convictions); State v. Tracy Thomas\nHepburn, No. M2008-01979-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 WL 2889101, at *11 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nJuly 23, 2010) (affirming the imposition of consecutive sentencing based upon the\ndefendant\u2019s extensive criminal activity when, in the case under review, the defendant was\nconvicted of sixty-two counts of burglary, attempted burglary, vandalism and theft\noffenses committed against approximately twenty-six businesses, some of which the\ndefendant victimized more than once, over a period of approximately five weeks); State\nv. State v. Alex Dewayne Welles, No. W2003-02282-CCA-R3-CD, 2004 WL 1606976,\nat *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 16, 2004) (upholding consecutive sentencing for a\ndefendant convicted of forty-eight crimes occurring within a ten-month period, involving\n\n                                            -20-\n\fat least twenty-eight victims, some of whom the defendant victimized on more than one\noccasion).\n\n       At this juncture, we note that the judgment forms for Counts 7 through 10 do not\nproperly reflect the trial court\u2019s ruling. The judgment forms in the record indicate that\nCounts 7 and 8 run concurrently with one another but consecutively to Counts 1 through\n6. The judgment forms for Counts 9 and 10 reflect that they run concurrently with one\nanother but consecutively to Counts 1 through 8. However, this was not the trial court\u2019s\ndesired sentencing structure. The trial court stated specifically that \u201cCounts 7 through 10\nwhich involve the two break-ins at the Best Buy business\u201d were to be served concurrently\nwith one another but consecutively to Counts 1 through 6. The proper alignment of these\nfour counts results in an effective fourteen-year sentence, as computed by the trial court.\nAccordingly, the judgments in Counts 7 through 10 are remanded for correction.\n\n                                     III. Count 14\n\n        Finally, we address the Defendant\u2019s argument that his sentence of continuous\nconfinement for Count 14 was contrary to Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-122\nbecause he was convicted of a non-violent property offense. The State concedes the\npoint, acknowledging that, because the Defendant was convicted of a non-violent\nproperty offense in Count 14, a period of continuous confinement was not authorized by\nstatute.\n\n       Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-122 governs sentencing for non-violent\nproperty offenses, and it provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n              (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, except as\n       provided in subsection (b), the judge sentencing a defendant who commits a\n       non-violent property offense, as defined in subsection (c), on or after July\n       1, 2010, shall not be authorized to impose the sentencing alternatives of\n       continuous confinement in a local jail or the department of correction as\n       authorized by \u00a7 40-35-104(c)(5), (c)(6), or (c)(8). However, the judge may\n       sentence the defendant to any of the other sentencing alternatives\n       authorized by \u00a7 40-35-104(c), which include, but are not limited to,\n       periodic confinement, work release, community corrections, probation, or\n       judicial diversion.\n\n              (b)(1) A defendant convicted of an offense set out in subsection (c)\n       may be sentenced to any of the sentencing alternatives authorized by \u00a7 40-\n       35-104(c), including a period of continuous confinement, if the sentencing\n       judge determines the defendant:\n\n                                           -21-\n\f              (A) Has at least one (1) prior conviction at the time the subsection\n      (c) offense is committed; or\n\n             (B) Violated the terms and conditions of the alternative sentence\n      originally imposed upon the defendant pursuant to subsection (a).\n\n             ....\n\n             (c) As used in this section, a non-violent property offense is:\n\n             ....\n\n              (11) Felony theft of property under \u00a7 39-14-103, where the amount\n      of the theft is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000)[.]\n\nTennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-104(c) provides for \u201c[t]he following sentencing\nalternatives in any appropriate combination are authorized for defendants otherwise\neligible under this chapter\u201d:\n\n            (1) Payment of a fine either alone or in addition to any other\n      sentence authorized by this subsection (c);\n\n             (2) Payment of restitution to the victim or victims either alone or in\n      addition to any other sentence authorized by this subsection (c);\n\n             (3) A sentence of confinement that is suspended upon a term of\n      probation supervision that may include community service or restitution, or\n      both;\n\n              (4) A sentence of periodic confinement that may be served in a local\n      jail or workhouse in conjunction with a term of probation;\n\n            (5) A sentence of continuous confinement to be served in a local jail\n      or workhouse in conjunction with a term of probation;\n\n           (6) A sentence of continuous confinement in a local jail or\n      workhouse;\n\n             (7) Work release in accordance with \u00a7 40-35-315;\n\n             (8) A sentence of continuous confinement in the department of\n      correction if the conviction is for a felony and the sentence is at least one\n      (1) year, unless:\n                                           -22-\n\f             (A) The sentence is prohibited by subsection (b); or\n\n             (B) The defendant is convicted of a violation of \u00a7 39-14-103,\n      involving property valued at less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), and\n      the defendant is sentenced as an especially mitigated offender as defined in\n      \u00a7 40-35-109 or a standard offender as defined in \u00a7 40-35-105; or\n\n            (9) A sentence to a community based alternative to incarceration in\n      accordance with the provisions, including eligibility requirements, of\n      chapter 36 of this title.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-104 (2014).\n\n        Ordinarily, the trial court has discretion to determine whether a defendant should\nserve a sentence in confinement or should be granted an alternative sentence. State v.\nNicholas Cole, No. M2015-02286-CCA-R3-CD, 2016 WL 6087672, at *8. However, if a\ndefendant has been convicted of one of the enumerated non-violent property offenses\nlisted in section 40-35-122(c), the trial court cannot order continuous confinement unless\nthe defendant has a prior felony conviction or if the defendant has \u201c[v]iolated the terms\nand conditions of the alternative sentence originally imposed upon the defendant . . . . \u201d\nId. (quoting Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-122(a) & (b)). This statute was enacted in 2010\nwith the goal of allowing non-violent property offenders \u201cto work in order to pay\nrestitution to the victims of their crimes without using scarce prison beds thereby\npermitting longer sentences for those offenders who do threaten public safety.\u201d Id.\n(quoting Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-122, Compiler\u2019s Notes; 2010 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch.\n1090, \u00a7 1). Moreover, this court has previously held that section 40-35-122 is \u201cclear and\nunambiguous; therefore, it should [be] enforced as written because \u2018it is generally\npresumed that the legislature acted purposefully in the subject included or excluded.\u2019\u201d\nState v. Astin D. Hill, No. W2012-02147-CCA-R3-CD, 2014 WL 683892, at * 5 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Feb. 19, 2014) (quoting State v. Pope, 427 S.W.3d 363, 368 (Tenn. 2013));\nsee also State v. Hawk, 170 S.W.3d 547, 551 (Tenn. 2005) (discussing statutory\ninterpretation).\n\n       Further, \u201c[s]ection 40-35-122(a) specifically and unequivocally omits the three\ncontinuous confinement provisions of Section 40-35[-]104(c) from the sentences\navailable for a non-violent property offender.\u201d State v. Preston Rashad Royal, No.\nW2015-01334-CCA-R3-CD, 2016 WL 1446097, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 12, 2016).\nIf section 40-35-122 applies, the trial court cannot order split confinement, where a\ndefendant serves some time in continuous confinement and the remainder of the sentence\non probation. Cole, 2016 WL 6087672, at *8 (citing State v. Devon Elliott Cruze, No.\nE2014-01847-CCA-R3-CD, 2015 WL 5064070, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 27, 2015)\n\n                                           -23-\n\f(reversing the trial court\u2019s order that the defendant serve sixty days in continuous\nconfinement and the balance on probation as violative of section 40-35-122).\n\n        Section 40-35-122 applies to the Defendant\u2019s case. The Defendant was convicted\nin Count 14 of theft of property valued at more than $500 but less than $1000, for events\noccurring on June 16, 2016, at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Theft under $1000 is a non-\nviolent property offense as defined by Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-\n122(c)(11). Moreover, the Defendant did not have any prior qualifying felony\nconviction, and the Defendant was never placed on any alternative sentence for the\ninstant offenses. Accordingly, he fell squarely within the ambit of section 40-35-122, and\nthe trial court was not authorized to sentence him to continuous confinement for two\nyears. See, e.g., State v. Sandra Kay Stutts, No. W2016-01681-CCA-R3-CD, 2018 WL\n637943, at *5-6 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 31, 2018); Cole, 2016 WL 6087672, at *6-9;\nRoyal, 2016 WL 1446097, at *1-2; Cruze, No. E2014-01847-CCA-R3-CD, 2015 WL\n5064070, at *4; Hill, 2014 WL 683892, at *4-5 (all concluding the same under similar\nfact patterns).\n\n       We agree with both the Defendant and the State that the Defendant\u2019s sentence on\nCount 14 should be vacated. However, the Defendant also asks this court to remand the\ncase to a different trial judge relying on Hill. The Defendant explains, \u201cDue to the\nDivision II judge\u2019s failure to follow the clear, plain language of the statute at issue here,\nhowever, the same relief is warranted in the instant matter\u201d as provided in Hill. When a\ntrial court\u2019s error negates the standard of abuse of discretion with a presumption of\nreasonableness, this court may conduct a de novo review or remand the issue. See\nPollard, 432 S.W.3d at 864-65 (concluding same when the trial court fails to provide\nadequate reason for the imposing consecutive sentences); State v. King, 432 S.W.3d 316,\n327-28 (Tenn. 2014) (concluding same when the trial court\u2019s comments denying judicial\ndiversion were inadequate). We believe this is a more appropriate case for de novo\nreview.\n\n         In the five cases cited above wherein this court reached the same conclusion that\nthe trial court erred in imposing continuous confinement for a non-violent property\noffense, this court has remanded the case for resentencing with instructions to the trial\ncourt to impose a sentence authorized by the applicable statutes. However, the trial judge\nin this case is the same trial judge as in Hill and Royal. Hill was decided in February\n2014, and this court remanded to a different trial judge because the trial judge specifically\nacknowledged its understanding of section 40-35-122 but declined to follow it, instead\n\u201ctaking the position that the Legislature could not have intended for it to apply to\nsomeone with the [d]efendant\u2019s juvenile criminal history.\u201d 2014 WL 683892, at *7. In\nRoyal, decided in April 2016, the same judge again overruled the Defendant\u2019s objection\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\fto the legality of his sentences before being reversed on appeal. 2016 WL 1446097, at\n*1.\n\n        Pursuant to dictates of section 40-35-122, sentencing alternatives are limited to\nthose listed in section 40-35-104(c)(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), and (9). Regarding subsections\n(c)(1) and (2), the trial court imposed a fine of $1000 on Count 14 but did not order\nrestitution. We see no reason to depart from this determination. Moreover, we feel that\nthe appropriate sentence for the Defendant\u2019s conviction for Class E felony theft is\nsupervised probation pursuant to subsection (c)(3). The Defendant will serve twelve\nyears in the Department of Correction before beginning service of his mandatorily\nconsecutive two-year sentence on Count 14. All of the Defendant\u2019s convictions are for\nnon-violent property offenses, although the others are not governed by section -122. The\nDefendant\u2019s effective sentence\u2014twelve years\u2019 incarceration followed by two years\u2019\nprobation\u2014is sufficient to protect the public from the Defendant and will serve to\nappropriately punish him for his crimes. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-102(1) & (3).\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on our review of the record and the applicable law, we affirm in part and\nreverse in part the judgments of the trial court. In accordance with this opinion, Counts 7\nthrough 10 are remanded for correction of clerical errors in the judgment forms. The\nsentence in Count 14 is vacated, and the trial court is ordered upon remand to enter a\njudgment reflecting that the Defendant\u2019s two-year sentence on that count be served on\nsupervised probation with the imposition of $1000 fine. The remaining counts are\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  _________________________________\n                                                  D.
