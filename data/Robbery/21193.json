The\n\ntrial court denied his motion to suppress. Appellant pled guilty to the indictment and was sentenced\n\nto two years\u2019 confinement in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division,\n\nprobated for two years. At issue is the denial of his motion to suppress. For the reasons that follow,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellant filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence. At the hearing, Officer Balderrama\n\ntestified that he and his partner, Officer Chapa, were dispatched to an apartment complex regarding\n\nan unknown problem. The officers met with Raquel Graciano and her 14-year-old son, Christian\n\nSilva, about a family disturbance. Appellant was not at the apartment.\n\n       Officer Balderrama spoke with Christian. The boy explained that there had been an argument\n\nand that Appellant had created a mess in the apartment. Christian also described how Appellant\n\fbroke into cars. He had some \u201cstickers\u201d and he would cut and change the numbers.1 Christian then\n\nwent into the apartment, retrieved the stickers, came back outside, and handed the stickers to the\n\nofficer. Balderrama did not ask Christian to bring him the stickers but he observed the boy grab the\n\nstickers from a living room closet approximately five feet from the open front door of the apartment.\n\nBalderrama turned the stickers into evidence and completed his report.\n\n       On cross-examination, Balderrama testified that his reason for being at the residence was in\n\nresponse to a 911 call. Graciano and Christian were outside the apartment when he arrived.\n\nBalderrama spoke with Christian and asked him what happened. Christian told him about an\n\nargument and that Appellant was throwing milk, dropping tables, breaking into cars, and that he had\n\nstickers. After Christian handed the stickers to Balderrama, Graciano told him he was going to get\n\nin trouble with Appellant because the closet belonged to him. Balderrama did not enter the\n\napartment.\n\n       Graciano testified that Appellant had lived with her at the apartment for approximately five\n\nmonths. He was not home when the police arrived. Her son went outside first, and she followed\n\nhim. She denied fighting with Appellant, and described an argument with her children over some\n\nspilled cereal. The police did not ask permission to talk to Christian and she did not see the police\n\nenter her apartment. The closet had a chain lock that had been broken by her kids. Everything in\n\nthe closet belonged to Appellant. Graciano did not give Christian permission to get anything from\n\nthe closet and she did not consent to a search of her home. She asked her son why he took something\n\nthat did not belong to him. But she did not physically stop him from giving the documents to the\n\npolice because she had gone back inside.\n\n       At the close of the evidence, the trial court entered a finding that although Appellant had an\n\n       1\n           The record reveals that the \u201cstickers\u201d were fraudulent Texas automobile registration decals.\n\fexpectation of privacy, \u201cthe police never entered the home, never entered the residence.\u201d The judge\n\ndenied the motion to suppress and entered the following findings on the record:\n\n        The officer was at the residence investigating the disturbance. The officer was not\n        there investigating the activity of having illegal stickers. The officer did not direct\n        the young boy to go and retrieve the stickers, but rather, the young boy volunteered\n        the fact that the stickers were there and volunteered to go get the stickers. Therefore,\n        there was no search, which was the court\u2019s previous finding. But the additional\n        finding that I need to make today is that the child was not acting as an agent because\n        the activities of the young man occurred before the officer even knew about the\n        illegality of the stickers that were there. But it was at the action of the child that then\n        the officer became aware of the fact that there were illegal stickers.\n\n                                      MOTION TO SUPPRESS\n\n        In his sole issue for review, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion\n\nto suppress.\n\n                                          Standard of Review\n\n        We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress using the bifurcated standard of\n\nreview articulated in Guzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997). See Carmouche v.\n\nState, 10 S.W.3d 323, 327 (Tex.Crim.App. 2000); Krug v. State, 86 S.W.3d 764, 765 (Tex.App.--El\n\nPaso 2002, pet. ref\u2019d). Because the trial judge is the sole trier of fact regarding the credibility of and\n\nthe weight to be given to a witness\u2019s testimony, we do not engage in our own factual review of the\n\ntrial court\u2019s decision. See State v. Ross, 32 S.W.3d 853, 855 (Tex.Crim.App. 2000); Romero v.\n\nState, 800 S.W.2d 539, 543 (Tex.Crim.App. 1990). Almost total deference is given to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s ruling on questions of historical fact and application of law to fact questions that turn on an\n\nevaluation of credibility and demeanor. Montanez v. State, 195 S.W.3d 101, 106 (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n2006), citing Guzman, 955 S.W.2d at 89. A trial court\u2019s rulings on mixed questions of law and fact\n\nthat do not turn on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses are reviewed de novo. Id.\n\n                                           Agent of the State\n\f       The trial court found that Christian was not acting as an agent of the State when he obtained\n\nthe stickers from the closet and turned them over to Balderrama. This is a mixed question of law and\n\nfact that does not turn on the credibility and demeanor of a witness which we review de novo.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment protects the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\n\npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV. For the\n\npurposes of the Fourth Amendment, a \u201csearch\u201d occurs when the government violates a subjective\n\nexpectation of privacy that society considers objectively reasonable. See Kyllo v. United States, 533\n\nU.S. 27, 33, 121 S. Ct. 2038, 2042-43, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94 (2001). However, the Fourth Amendment\n\nproscribes only governmental action, not action by a private individual who is not acting as an agent\n\nof the government or with the knowledge and participation of a government official. United States\n\nv. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 1656, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984). Even a wrongful\n\nsearch or seizure by a private citizen does not deprive the government of the right to use evidence\n\nobtained from the wrongful search. See Walter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649, 656, 100 S. Ct. 2395,\n\n2401, 65 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1980).\n\n       The government may not encourage conduct by private persons that the government itself\n\ncannot do, and if the government encourages a search, or the private citizen searches solely for the\n\npurpose of aiding in law enforcement, the search is illegal. Morrow v. State, 757 S.W.2d 484, 489\n\n(Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, pet. ref\u2019d), citing Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443,\n\n488, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 2049, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971). To determine whether a person is acting as an\n\n\u201cinstrument\u201d or agent of the government, we ask (1) whether the government knew of, and\n\nacquiesced in, the intrusive conduct, and (2) whether the party performing the search intended to\n\nassist law enforcement efforts or, instead, to further his own ends. Stoker v. State, 788 S.W.2d 1, 11\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1989). De minimis or incidental contacts between the citizen and law enforcement\n\fagents before or during the course of a search or seizure will not subject the search to Fourth\n\nAmendment scrutiny. United States v. Walther, 652 F.2d 788, 791 (9th Cir.1981).\n\n                                             ANALYSIS\n\n        We conduct our analysis of this question on a case-by-case basis in light of all the\n\ncircumstances. United States v. Hall, 142 F.3d 988, 993 (7th Cir.1998). The defendant bears the\n\nburden of proving that a private party acted as an agent of the government. United States v. Feffer,\n\n831 F.2d 734, 737 (7th Cir.1987).\n\n        We begin with Dawson v. State, 106 S.W.3d 388, 390 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2003,\n\nno pet.). There, a motel manager was concerned about the amount of traffic in and out of a room.\n\nHe told a police officer his suspicions about illegal drug activity he believed to be occurring. Id.\n\nThe same officer would intermittently stop by the motel to get some coffee or use the restroom. Id.\n\nOn one such occasion, the manager invited the officer to check on the room. Id. at 391. The\n\nmanager entered the room, took a look around, and changed the lock. Id. The officer was standing\n\nnear the door when this happened and smelled the odor of burnt marijuana. The officer obtained a\n\nsearch warrant, which he executed two days later, and found marijuana, cocaine, and drug\n\nparaphernalia in the room. Id. On appeal, the defendant argued that the motel manager was acting\n\nas an agent of the police and his entry into the room was pretextual. Therefore, the cocaine later\n\ndiscovered was the fruit of an illegal search. Id. The court found that the manager initiated the entry\n\ninto the room for the purpose of checking for damage or abandonment; that the officer did not ask\n\nthe manager to enter the room; and that the officer did not cross the threshold. Id. at 392. The earlier\n\nconversations between the manager and the officer regarding the drug activity were found to be\n\nsufficiently general and remote to constitute only de minimis contact. Id. The manager had a\n\nlegitimate reason to enter the room, and that the record indicated that his entry was intended to\n\ffurther his own ends as a manager, not to further the State\u2019s ends. Id. The court concluded that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to suppress. Id. at 393.\n\n       Similarly, in Stoker v. State, 788 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Tex.Crim.App. 1989), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990), a\n\nconfidential informant was arranging drug transactions with the defendant when he discovered that\n\nthe defendant had a pistol used in some armed robberies and murders. The informant initiated a\n\nconversation with a deputy concerning the defendant\u2019s possession of a weapon that had been used\n\nin criminal conduct. Id. The deputy told the informant, \u201cif you ever acquire it, I would like to see\n\nit.\u201d Id. The officer did not instruct the informant on how to obtain the weapon, or even that he\n\nshould obtain it. Id. The court found that since law enforcement officials did not direct the\n\ninformant to retrieve the weapon, and had no reason to know that he would enter the defendant\u2019s\n\nhome to acquire it, the court could not conclude that the state \u201cknew of or acquiesced in the intrusive\n\nconduct.\u201d Id.\n\n       And in United States v. Crowley, 285 F.3d 553, 558 (7th Cir. 2002), federal authorities\n\nnotified local delivery services to watch for suspicious packages addressed to the defendant. A UPS\n\ndriver noticed such a package while making deliveries and opened it. Id. at 556. The driver re-\n\nwrapped it and contacted local law enforcement. Id. Two narcotics officers responded and met with\n\nthe driver in the back of the truck. While the agents were momentarily distracted by an approaching\n\nvehicle, the driver reopened the package and showed the content to the officers. Id. The officers\n\nobtained a search warrant. Id. The defendant moved to suppress the package on the grounds the\n\ndriver was an agent of law enforcement. Id. at 558. The trial court disagreed, finding that the driver\n\nwas \u201cacting on her own, without having received any direction from the police.\u201d Id. at 557. The\n\nappellate court held that the officers neither encouraged nor induced the driver to open the package\n\fand determined that the driver was not a government agent. Id. at 559.\n\n        Appellant argues that Christian had no reason to enter into his closet and retrieve the\n\nevidence other than to further an investigation by the police. The record shows that Balderrama\n\nquestioned Christian and Christian reported the illegal activity. But the record does not show, and\n\nthe trial court did not find, that Balderrama directed or induced Christian to retrieve the stickers. The\n\nboy voluntarily gave the stickers to the officer. See Dawson, 106 S.W.3d 392; Crowley, 285 F.3d\n\n556. We conclude that Christian did not act as an instrument or agent of the government because\n\nBalderrama did not anticipate or acquiesce in the intrusive conduct. See Stoker, 788 S.W.2d 11.\n\n                                             Article 38.23\n\n        In the alternative, Appellant argues that the search and seizure was illegal under Article 38.23\n\nof the Texas Rules of Criminal Procedure. Article 38.23 states in relevant part that \u201c[n]o evidence\n\nobtained by an officer or other person in violation of any provisions . . . or laws of the United States\n\nof America, shall be admitted in evidence against the accused.\u201d TEX .CODE CRIM .PROC.ANN . art.\n\n38.23(a)(Vernon 2005). Appellant maintains that Christian violated Section 30.05 and Section 30.02\n\nof the Texas Penal Code such that the evidence should be excluded. We disagree because the\n\nrequired elements of these crimes are not met. With regard to criminal trespass under Section 30.05,\n\nthe offense requires intrusion of the entire body. TEX .PENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7 30.05(a)(Vernon 2003);\n\nFerguson v. State, 634 S.W.2d 306, 309 (Tex.Crim.App. 1982). The record indicates that Christian\n\nlived in the apartment, the closet was located in the living room, and it was approximately five feet\n\nfrom the front door. Christian simply opened the closet and grabbed the stickers. As for the offense\n\nof burglary in violation of Section 30.02, a person commits an offense if he either: (1) enters a\n\nhabitation with intent to commit a theft; or (2) enters a habitation and commits theft. TEX .PENAL\n\nCODE ANN . \u00a7 30.02(a). Turning over evidence to law enforcement can negate the criminal-intent\n\felement required for theft. Stone v. State, 574 S.W.2d 85 (Tex.Crim.App. 1978)(babysitter\u2019s action\n\nin turning over photographs to the police negated any inference that she sought to deprive the\n\ndefendant of his property); Jenschke v. State, 147 S.W.3d 398 (Tex.Crim.App. 2004). By\n\nimmediately turning over the stickers to the police, Christian lacked the requisite intent to commit\n\ntheft necessary to commit the offense of burglary. Finding no abuse of discretion, we overrule the\n\nsole point and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\nJune 30, 2010\n                                                         ANN CRAWFORD McCLURE, Justice\n\nBefore Chew, C.J., McClure, and Rivera, JJ.\nRivera, J., not participating\n\n(Do Not Publish)\n\f",
