Memorandum: The evidence was sufficient to support the court\u2019s adjudication that respondent committed an act which, if done by an adult, would constitute third degree robbery. The court erred, however, in delegating to the Probation Department the authority to fix the amount of restitution (see, Family Ct Act \u00a7 353.6 [1] [a]; People v Fuller, 57 NY2d 152; People v De Berry, 117 AD2d 1006).
