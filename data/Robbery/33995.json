The testimony was based on a business record and thus constituted an exception to the rule against hearsay (see, CPLR 4518 [a]; Prince, Richardson on Evidence \u00a7 8-301 [Farrell 11th ed]). Additionally, a proper foundation was established (see, People v Kennedy, 68 NY2d 569, 579-580). Although the record itself was not offered into evidence, on the facts here this was appropriate in order to avoid risking undue prejudice to the defendant (see, United States v Baker, 442 F2d 1024, cert denied 404 US 883; People v Balone, 52 AD2d 216; see also, People v Woods, 161 AD2d 1176).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or- without merit. Miller, J. P., Copertino, Sullivan and Altman, JJ., concur.\n",
