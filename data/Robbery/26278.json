The trial\n\n\n       1 Act of May 26, 1999, 76th Leg., R.S., ch. 727, \u00a7 1, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws 3336, amended by Act\nof May 19, 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., ch. 338, \u00a7 2, 2017 Tex. Gen. Laws 978 (current version at TEX. PENAL\nCODE ANN. \u00a7 30.02(c)(2)).\n\fcourt suspended Appellant\u2019s sentence and placed him on community supervision for a\n\nperiod of five years. The trial court later extended the term of Appellant\u2019s community\n\nsupervision by an additional year.           In 2017, the State moved to revoke Appellant\u2019s\n\ncommunity supervision alleging that he had committed aggravated sexual assault of a\n\nchild and violated other conditions of his probation. Appellant was later convicted of\n\naggravated sexual assault of a child2 and sentenced to fifty years confinement on\n\nFebruary 28, 2018.          The trial court revoked Appellant\u2019s community supervision and\n\nsentenced him to five years confinement, to run concurrently with his sentence for\n\naggravated sexual assault, on March 5, 2018. These appeals followed.\n\n\n       The appellate record in cause 07-18-00197-CR was due on June 28, 2018, and in\n\ncause 07-18-00196-CR on July 3, 2018. The clerk\u2019s record was timely filed in both\n\nappeals, but the reporter sought a thirty-day extension in each cause due to her case\n\nload. We granted the reporter the extensions and subsequently granted two additional\n\nthirty-day extensions in each cause. With the last extensions, we admonished the\n\nreporter that failure to file the reporter\u2019s record by the given deadlines could result in the\n\nappeals being abated and the causes remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 37.3(a)(2).           The reporter did not file the reporter\u2019s record by the\n\ncourt\u2019s deadlines and now seeks a fourth extension to October 22, 2018, in each cause.\n\n\n       The court reporter is responsible for preparing, certifying, and timely filing the\n\nreporter's record. TEX. R. APP. P. 35.3(b). Additionally, trial and appellate courts are\n\njointly responsible for ensuring that the appellate record is timely filed. TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n\n\n       2   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.021(a)(2)(B), (f)(1) (West Supp. 2018).\n\n                                                    2\n\f35.3(c). Consequently, we now abate these appeals and remand the causes to the trial\n\ncourt for further proceedings.\n\n\n       Upon remand, the trial court shall utilize whatever means necessary to determine\n\nthe reasons for the delay in filing the reporter\u2019s record and take such action as is\n\nnecessary to ensure the filing of same on or before October 29, 2018. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 37.3(a)(2). The trial court shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall\n\ncause its findings, conclusions, and any necessary orders to be included in a\n\nsupplemental clerk\u2019s record filed with this court by November 5, 2018.\n\n\n       Should the reporter file the reporter\u2019s record on or before October 22, 2018, she is\n\ndirected to immediately notify the trial court, in writing, of the filing whereupon the trial\n\ncourt shall not be required to take further action.\n\n\n       It is so ordered.\n\n\n                                                  Per Curiam\n\n\nDo not publish.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f",
