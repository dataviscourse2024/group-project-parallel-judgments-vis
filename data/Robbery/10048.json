It also found that he had\n\nprior convictions for armed robbery and attempted armed robbery. He was sentenced to a\n\nmitigated, enhanced, eight-year term of imprisonment for possession of a narcotic drug and\n\npresumptive, enhanced, 3.75-year terms of imprisonment for each of the other convictions,\n\nall to be served concurrently.\n\n\u00b62            On appeal, Joyner maintains his sentences for the possession convictions are\n\nillegal. He argues that, as a matter of law, his prior convictions for armed robbery and\n\nattempted armed robbery do not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d in\n\nA.R.S. \u00a7 13-604.04, and he is therefore eligible for mandatory probation. See A.R.S. \u00a7 13-\n\n901.01. On this record, we agree.\n\n                                 Procedural Background\n\n\u00b63            The state alleged in Joyner\u2019s indictment that he was \u201cineligible for probation\n\npursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-901.01\u201d based on his past convictions for attempted armed robbery\n\nand armed robbery, \u201cwhich was a violent crime.\u201d After the guilty verdicts were rendered,\n\nthe state presented the jury with evidence of Joyner\u2019s prior criminal convictions, including\n\ncharging documents, plea agreements, sentencing minute entries, and presentence reports for\n\nboth offenses. The jury found Joyner had been previously convicted of armed robbery and\n\nattempted armed robbery, which were identified in the verdict forms by specific cause\n\nnumbers.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f\u00b64            At sentencing, neither the parties nor the trial court addressed the potential\n\napplication of \u00a7 13-901.01, and the presentence report simply noted, \u201c[n]o probation\n\navailable.\u201d1 The court \u201creaffirm[ed]\u201d the convictions and the jury\u2019s findings that Joyner had\n\ntwo prior felony convictions before imposing sentence.\n\n                                    Standard of Review\n\n\u00b65            Because Joyner did not raise the issues he raises now at sentencing, we review\n\nhis claims only for fundamental error. See State v. Henderson, 210 Ariz. 561, \u00b6 19, 115\n\nP.3d 601, 607 (2005). \u201cTo prevail under this standard of review, a defendant must establish\n\nboth that fundamental error exists and that the error in his case caused him prejudice.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 20. We will not disturb a sentence that is within the statutory range absent an abuse of the\n\ntrial court\u2019s discretion. State v. Russell, 175 Ariz. 529, 534, 858 P.2d 674, 679 (App.\n\n1993). On the other hand, \u201c[t]he failure to impose a sentence in conformity with mandatory\n\nsentencing statutes makes the resulting sentence illegal.\u201d State v. Carbajal, 184 Ariz. 117,\n\n118, 907 P.2d 503, 504 (App. 1995). And we have held that the \u201c[i]mposition of an illegal\n\nsentence constitutes fundamental error.\u201d State v. Thues, 203 Ariz. 339, \u00b6 4, 54 P.3d 368,\n\n369 (App. 2002); see also State v. Vargas-Burgos, 162 Ariz. 325, 327, 783 P.2d 264, 266\n\n\n       1\n         Although Joyner had argued in a sentencing memorandum that \u201con the current state\nof the record probation is still mandatory . . . [because] the jury never made any finding with\nrespect to the \u2018violent\u2019 nature\u201d of his prior convictions, he appears to have abandoned this\nargument at the sentencing hearing. Moreover, Joyner never raised the argument he now\nmakes on appeal: that, as a matter of law and statutory definition, a conviction for armed\nrobbery cannot constitute a conviction for a \u201cviolent crime\u201d as defined in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-\n604.04(B).\n\n                                              3\n\f(App. 1989) (claim that sentence illegal not waived by failure to object in trial court).\n\nMoreover, \u201c[w]hether the trial court applied the correct sentencing statute is a question of\n\nlaw, which we review de novo.\u201d State v. Hollenback, 212 Ariz. 12, \u00b6 12, 126 P.3d 159, 163\n\n(App. 2005).           Sentencing Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-901.01\n\n\u00b66             Section 13-901.01 is the codification of a voter initiative commonly known\n\nas Proposition 200 that \u201csignificantly changed the legal consequences for defendants\n\nconvicted of certain nonviolent, first- and second-time drug offenses.\u201d2 State v. Rodriguez,\n\n200 Ariz. 105, \u00b6 2, 23 P.3d 100, 101 (App. 2001). Specifically, \u00a7 13-901.01(A) provides:\n\n                      Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any person\n               who is convicted of the personal possession or use of a\n               controlled substance or drug paraphernalia is eligible for\n               probation. The court shall suspend the imposition or execution\n               of sentence and place the person on probation.\n\n\u00b67             There are limited exceptions to this mandatory probation requirement,\n\nhowever. A court is not required to place a defendant on probation when a defendant has\n\nbeen convicted for a third time of personal possession of a controlled substance, see \u00a7 13-\n\n901.01(H)(1); State v. Guillory, 199 Ariz. 462, \u00b6 3, 18 P.3d 1261, 1263 (App. 2001), or\n\nwhen a defendant \u201chas been convicted of or indicted for a violent crime as defined in \u00a713-\n\n604.04,\u201d \u00a7 13-901.01(B). Section 13-604.04, which was also enacted to give effect to\n\nProposition 200, 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 6, \u00a7 1, defines a violent crime as \u201cany criminal\n\n\n\n       The initiative was titled \u201cDrug Medicalization, Prevention, and Control Act of\n       2\n\n1996.\u201d 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws, p. 2895.\n\n                                             4\n\fact that results in death or physical injury or any criminal use of a deadly weapon or\n\ndangerous instrument,\u201d \u00a7 13-604.04(B). Thus, a defendant who has multiple prior\n\nconvictions for drug offenses or any prior conviction for a violent crime is subject to\n\n\u201c[s]tandard felony sentencing provisions that permit imprisonment.\u201d Foster v. Irwin, 196\n\nAriz. 230, \u00b6 3, 995 P.2d 272, 273-74 (2000). Conversely, \u201c[a] prior conviction for a\n\nnon-violent, non-drug-related crime does not negate the probation requirement\u201d of \u00a7 13-\n\n901.01. Foster, 196 Ariz. 230, \u00b6 10, 995 P.2d at 276.\n\n\u00b68           Here, the trial court implicitly found Joyner was ineligible for mandatory\n\nprobation under \u00a7 13-901.01(B) (and, by reference, \u00a7 13-604.04) because of Joyner\u2019s prior\n\nconvictions for armed robbery and attempted armed robbery. Citing State v. Crawford, 214\n\nAriz. 129, 149 P.3d 753 (2007); State v. Hinchey, 165 Ariz. 432, 799 P.2d 352 (1990); and\n\nCherry v. Araneta, 203 Ariz. 532, 57 P.3d 391 (App. 2002), Joyner argues that whether a\n\ndefendant\u2019s prior conviction may be characterized as a violent crime as defined in \u00a7 13-\n\n604.04 is a legal question that may be resolved only by reference to the statutory elements\n\nof the offense of conviction, without consideration of the underlying facts. And, according\n\nto Joyner, a conviction for armed robbery does not necessarily establish a \u201ccriminal use of\n\na deadly weapon or dangerous instrument,\u201d \u00a7 13-604.04, because armed robbery may also\n\nbe committed by using or threatening to use a simulated deadly weapon, see A.R.S. \u00a7 13-\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f1904.3 The state, on the other hand, urges us to affirm the court\u2019s implicit finding that\n\nJoyner had previously been convicted of a violent crime by considering facts alleged in the\n\ndocuments of record for his prior convictions, including the charging documents, a pretrial\n\nrelease statement, a presentence report, and a sentencing minute entry. According to the\n\nstate, those documents establish Joyner used a gun when he committed his prior offenses.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       Section 13-1904, A.R.S., provides:\n\n                   A. A person commits armed robbery if, in the course of\n              committing robbery as defined in \u00a7 13-1902, such person or an\n              accomplice:\n\n                   1. Is armed with a deadly weapon or a simulated deadly\n              weapon; or\n\n                    2. Uses or threatens to use a deadly weapon or\n              dangerous instrument or a simulated deadly weapon.\n\nSection 13-1902(A), A.R.S., provides:\n\n                     A person commits robbery if in the course of taking any\n              property of another from his person or immediate presence and\n              against his will, such person threatens or uses force against any\n              person with intent either to coerce surrender of property or to\n              prevent resistance to such person taking or retaining property.\n\n\u201c\u2018Deadly weapon\u2019 means anything designed for lethal use, including a firearm,\u201d A.R.S.\n\u00a7 13-105(13), and \u201c\u2018[d]angerous instrument\u2019 means anything that under the circumstances\nin which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used is readily capable of\ncausing death or serious physical injury,\u201d \u00a7 13-105(11).\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                 Determination of Violent Nature of Prior Conviction\n\na.     Based on Statutory Definition\n\n\u00b69            Division One of this court has held that a court may consider the statutory\n\ndefinition of an offense to discern whether the elements required for conviction necessarily\n\nestablish the commission of a violent crime under \u00a7 13-901.01(B). Cherry, 203 Ariz. 532,\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 57 P.3d at 393 (previous plea of guilty to assault for \u201c[i]ntentionally, knowingly or\n\nrecklessly caus[ing] any physical injury to another person,\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1203(A)(1),\n\nnecessarily established \u201cphysical injury\u201d requirement of \u00a7 13-604.04) (first alteration in\n\nCherry); see also Montero v. Foreman, 204 Ariz. 378, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 64 P.3d 206, 209-10\n\n(App. 2003) (previous guilty plea to disorderly conduct \u201cin violation of A.R.S. \u00a7\n\n13-2904(A)(6),\u201d requiring finding that Montero \u201c[r]ecklessly handle[d], display[ed] or\n\ndischarge[d] a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument\u201d necessarily established violent crime\n\nunder \u00a7 13-604.04) (first alteration in Montero). In Cherry and Montero, the same proof\n\nrequired to find the defendants guilty of the elements of their charged offenses also\n\nestablished, necessarily, that they had been convicted of violent crimes as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 13-\n\n901.01(B) and 13-604.04. Cf. State v. Parker, 128 Ariz. 97, 99, 624 P.2d 294, 296 (1981)\n\n(dangerous nature allegation \u201cmust be submitted to the jury for a separate finding unless an\n\nelement of the offense charged contains an allegation and requires proof of the dangerous\n\nnature of the felony\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f\u00b610             In this case, by contrast, Joyner is correct that his prior conviction for armed\n\nrobbery, as defined in \u00a7 13-1904, does not necessarily establish he used a deadly weapon\n\nor dangerous instrument because armed robbery may be committed with a simulated deadly\n\nweapon\u2014and a \u201csimulated deadly weapon\u201d may be neither deadly nor dangerous. See, e.g.,\n\nState v. Bousley, 171 Ariz. 166, 168, 829 P.2d 1212, 1214 (1992) (positioning hands to\n\n\u201csimulate[] deadly weapons\u201d supported armed robbery conviction); State v. Felix, 153 Ariz.\n\n417, 419, 737 P.2d 393, 395 (App. 1986) (nasal inhaler constituted simulated deadly\n\nweapon). As a result, armed robbery, based solely on its statutory definition, is not\n\nnecessarily a violent crime under the definition in \u00a7 13-604.04.4 Thus, next we address\n\nwhether the other evidence the state proffered could be considered to establish the violent\n\nnature of Joyner\u2019s prior convictions.\n\nb.         Consideration of Underlying Facts Prohibited\n\n\u00b611             In Cherry, Division One of this court suggested, in dictum, that analyzing the\n\nstatutory elements of an offense is the only means of concluding a prior offense was violent\n\n\n\n       4\n        We are constrained by the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 13-604.04 and 13-1904. Using other\ndefinitions, robbery and armed robbery have been \u201crepeatedly found [to be] . . . crime[s] of\nviolence.\u201d State v. Lee, 185 Ariz. 549, 557, 917 P.2d 692, 700 (1996) (statutory definition\nof robbery \u201crequires the use of threat of force,\u201d which supported former A.R.S. \u00a7 13-\n703(F)(2) aggravating circumstance of prior conviction of crime involving violence); cf. State\nv. Tresize, 127 Ariz. 571, 574, 623 P.2d 1, 4 (1980) (under prior version of \u00a7 13-1904,\n1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 142, \u00a7 73, before statute amended to include simulated weapon,\njury instructed that armed robbery required proof defendant armed with or used deadly\nweapon or dangerous instrument and \u201cmust necessarily have concluded that the offense was\na dangerous offense\u201d subject to enhancement under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-604).\n\n                                                8\n\fas defined in \u00a7\u00a7 13-901.01 and 13-604.04, reasoning that \u201cwhether [a] prior conviction is\n\na violent crime for purposes of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-901.01 is a question of law for the trial judge.\u201d\n\n203 Ariz. 532, \u00b6 8, 57 P.3d at 393. Division One perceived that question to be a narrow\n\none, as explained below:\n\n              Analysis of the prior conviction \u201cis purely a legal question; it\n              does not depend on the merits of alternative versions of the\n              facts.\u201d [State v.] Ault, 157 Ariz. [516,] 520, 759 P.2d [1320,]\n              1324 [(1988)]. The scope of a trial court\u2019s review of the prior\n              conviction is limited, however, to the statutory elements of the\n              offense, without consideration of other evidence.\n\n203 Ariz. 532, \u00b6 11, 57 P.3d at 394.\n\n\u00b612           As the court noted in Cherry, in other contexts in which sentencing statutes\n\nrequire a trial court to determine the nature of a prior conviction, the court may consider\n\nonly the statutory elements necessary for the conviction.5 Id. This limitation \u201cguarantees\n\nthat a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights will not be violated,\u201d State v. Schaaf, 169\n\nAriz. 323, 333, 819 P.2d 909, 919 (1991), by subjecting the defendant to \u201cwhat is, in effect,\n\na second trial on [a] defendant\u2019s prior conviction to establish the existence\u201d of a sentencing\n\n\n\n       5\n        Because \u00a7 13-604.04 calls for a conclusion about the nature of a prior offense, we\ndistinguish it from sentencing factors that are established by mere proof that a prior\nconviction exists and liken it to those recidivist sentencing factors that require some\nadditional analysis. Compare, e.g., A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703(F)(2) (prior conviction for enumerated\n\u201cserious offense\u201d) with former \u00a7 13-703(F)(2), 1988 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 155, \u00a7 1 (prior\nfelony \u201cinvolving the use or threat of violence on another person\u201d); see also State v.

If \u2018the defendant [could] commit or be convicted of\n\nthe crime without the use or threat of violence, the prior conviction c[ould] not qualify as\n\na statutory aggravating circumstance\u2019\u201d under that statute.

As these cases suggest, because the nature of a prior conviction is \u201ca purely legal\n\nissue,\u201d limiting the court\u2019s analysis to the elements established by the prior conviction frees\n\nthe sentencing court \u201cfrom the burden of making factual determinations about the\n\ndefendant\u2019s underlying conduct.\u201d Crawford, 214 Ariz 129, \u00b6 9, 149 P.3d at 756.\n\n\u00b615           We see no reason why this same analysis should not apply here. We\n\nrecognize, as the state suggests, that it is unlikely the voters who enacted Proposition 200\n\nintended that a defendant with prior convictions for armed robbery and attempted armed\n\nrobbery be eligible for mandatory probation.6 But our supreme court has emphasized that\n\nthis rule\u2014that the nature of a prior conviction may only be determined by the statutory\n\nelements of the offense\u2014is required \u201c[t]o protect \u2018a criminal defendant\u2019s due process\n\nrights.\u2019\u201d Roque, 213 Ariz. 193, \u00b6 81, 141 P.3d at 391, quoting Schaaf, 169 Ariz. at 333-34,\n\n819 P.2d at 919-20. Such protections are due defendants being placed on probation under\n\n\u00a7 13-901.01 as well as those being sentenced under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-604, 13-702, and 13-703.\n\n\n       6\n        In fact, Division One of this court has also assumed robbery is among the violent\ncrimes that exclude a defendant from the benefits of mandatory probation under Proposition\n200. Gray v. Irwin, 195 Ariz. 273, \u00b6 13, 987 P.2d 759, 762 (App. 1999) (suggesting\ndefendants with \u201cprior felony convictions for homicide, sexual assault, and robbery\u201d would\nbe denied mandatory probation under \u00a7 13-901.01(B)).\n\n                                              11\n\fAccordingly, we hold that whether a prior conviction is a violent crime under \u00a7 13-\n\n901.01(B) is a legal determination based solely on the elements of the prior conviction.7\n\nc.     Evidence that Prior Conviction Was for Violent Offense\n\n\u00b616           Nonetheless, the state argues that the trial court was entitled to consider\n\ndocuments related to Joyner\u2019s prior convictions without subjecting Joyner to \u201c\u2018what\n\namounts to a second trial\u2019 on a prior conviction . . . because the relevant evidence is already\n\nin the record.\u201d None of the Arizona cases construing \u00a7\u00a7 13-604 or 13-703 has addressed\n\nwhether documents associated with a plea of guilty may be used to delimit the nature of a\n\nprior conviction when, as here, an offense has been broadly defined by statute. But some\n\nhave addressed whether a court may rely on charging documents or jury instructions that\n\nnarrow the elements of an offense in such a way that, even if the statutory definition is\n\nbroad, a court can still be certain that the fact of conviction necessarily established every\n\nelement required to prove the sentencing factor. In State v. Thompson, 186 Ariz. 529, 531-\n\n32, 924 P.2d 1048, 1050-51 (App. 1996), for example, Division One distinguished the\n\nunderlying facts of the prior crime from evidence of the prior conviction: \u201cIt is one thing\n\n. . . to preclude the State from \u2018bring[ing] in the victim of the prior crime, long after its\n\ncommission,\u2019 to establish the nature of the prior crime. It is another to preclude the State\n\nfrom introducing documentary evidence defining the nature of the prior conviction.\u201d Id.,\n\n\n\n       7\n        In light of this holding, we do not address Joyner\u2019s alternative argument that he is\nentitled to a jury trial on the question.\n\n                                              12\n\fquoting Schaaf, 169 Ariz. at 334, 819 P.2d at 920 (distinguishing Gillies, 135 Ariz. at\n\n511, 662 P.2d at 1018) (alteration in Thompson).\n\n\u00b617           Most recently, our supreme court addressed limitations on evidence a court\n\nmay consider to determine whether a prior conviction in another jurisdiction involves \u201c\u2018an\n\noffense which if committed within this state would be punishable as a felony\u2019\u201d for purposes\n\nof sentence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 13-604(N) and (W). Crawford, 214 Ariz. 129, \u00b6 1,\n\n149 P.3d at 754, quoting \u00a7 13-604(N). This determination requires comparison of the\n\nstatutory definitions and a \u201c\u2018strict conformity between the elements of the [foreign] felony\n\nand the elements of some Arizona felony.\u2019\u201d Id. \u00b6 7, quoting State v. Clough, 171 Ariz. 217,\n\n219, 829 P.2d 1263, 1265 (App. 1992).\n\n\u00b618           In Crawford, the state relied on Thompson in arguing that the trial court could\n\nhave considered Crawford\u2019s federal indictment for possessing a credit card stolen from the\n\nUnited States mail to establish conduct punishable as a felony in Arizona. 214 Ariz. 129,\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 4, 10, 149 P.3d at 755-56. Thompson had held that a charging document, when\n\nincorporated in a judgment of conviction, may be used to \u201cestablish[] that the defendant was\n\nconvicted under a particular subsection of a foreign statute, if that subsection encompasses\n\nonly conduct that would constitute a felony in Arizona.\u201d 186 Ariz. at 531-32, 924 P.2d at\n\n1050-51 (also construing \u00a7 13-604(N)).\n\n\u00b619           The supreme court emphasized the general rule that a sentencing court must\n\nfocus \u201csolely on the elements of the foreign statute,\u201d Crawford, 214 Ariz. 129, \u00b6 9, 149 P.3d\n\n\n                                             13\n\fat 756, and the limited nature of Thompson\u2019s exception, stating: \u201cThompson allows use of\n\na charging document \u2018only to narrow the [prior] conviction to a particular subsection of the\n\nstatute that served as the basis of the [prior] conviction\u2019 and not to establish \u2018the factual\n\nnature of the prior conviction.\u2019\u201d Crawford, 214 Ariz. 129, \u00b6 11, 149 P.3d at 756, quoting\n\nRoque, 213 Ariz. 193, \u00b6 88, 141 P.3d at 392. Because the federal statute at issue in\n\nCrawford contained no subsections, the court held Thompson was inapplicable. Crawford,\n\n214 Ariz. 129, \u00b6 11, 149 P.3d at 756.\n\n\u00b620           The court in Crawford noted that the \u201ccases interpreting \u00a7 13-604 are\n\nconsistent with our case law involving the use of foreign convictions in capital sentencing.\u201d\n\nId. \u00b6 8, citing Roque, 213 Ariz. 193, \u00b6\u00b6 82-88, 141 P.3d at 391-92 (California robbery was\n\n\u201cserious offense\u201d under \u00a7 13-703(F)(2)); State v. Henry, 176 Ariz. 569, 587, 863 P.2d 861,\n\n879 (1993) (California involuntary manslaughter not crime of violence under former\n\n\u00a7 13-703(F)(2)); State v. Schaaf, 169 Ariz. 323, 334, 819 P.2d 909, 920 (1991) (Nevada\n\nattempted murder not violent crime under former \u00a7 13-703(F)(2)). These cases, like\n\nCrawford, considered only the statutory definition of the foreign offense of conviction to\n\ndetermine the applicability of an Arizona sentencing factor.\n\n\u00b621           In contrast, some capital cases addressing whether a defendant had prior\n\nArizona convictions for crimes involving violence, an aggravating factor under former\n\n\u00a7 13-703(F)(2), suggest that jury instructions and forms of verdict may be considered\u2014not\n\nas extrinsic evidence of the facts underlying the conviction, but as intrinsic evidence of what\n\n\n                                              14\n\fthe jury necessarily decided by its verdict. For example, in State v. Walden, 183 Ariz. 595,\n\n617-18, 905 P.2d 974, 996-97 (1995), the court acknowledged that Arizona\u2019s statutory\n\ndefinitions of sexual assault and kidnapping did not necessarily establish crimes of violence\n\nbecause both can be committed using deceit rather than force. Id., citing holdings in State\n\nv. Bible, 175 Ariz. 549, 604, 858 P.2d 1152, 1207 (1993). But the court nonetheless found\n\nWalden\u2019s Hannah8 prior convictions were violent crimes under former \u00a7 13-703(F)(2) based\n\non limiting jury instructions that had defined the lack of consent element for sexual assault\n\nto mean \u201c\u2018the victim was coerced by the immediate or threatened use of force against a\n\nperson or property\u2019\u201d and the restraint element for kidnapping to \u201crequire[] a finding that the\n\nvictim\u2019s movements were restricted \u2018by physical force or intimidation.\u2019\u201d 183 Ariz. at 617,\n\n905 P.2d at 996. According to the supreme court, these jury instructions effectively refined\n\nthe statutory definitions, so \u201cthese prior convictions necessarily involved the use or threat\n\nof violence.\u201d Id. at 618, 905 P.2d at 997.\n\n\u00b622           In State v. McKinney, 185 Ariz. 567, 582-83, 917 P.2d 1214, 1229-30 (1996),\n\nthe court cited Walden, noting that although the defendant\u2019s \u201cprior conviction [for second-\n\ndegree murder] was for a crime that, on the face of the statute, might have been committed\n\nrecklessly\u201d and so could not be used as an aggravating factor under former \u00a7 13-703(F)(2),\n\nthe jury instructions or forms of verdict might have been used to \u201cnarrow the . . . charge\u201d\n\n\n\n\n       8\n        State v. Hannah, 126 Ariz. 575, 617 P.2d 527 (1980).\n\n                                             15\n\ffound in the statutory definition, 185 Ariz. at 583, 917 P.2d at 1230. As the court\n\nexplained:\n\n                      [Defendant]\u2019s prior conviction is not disqualified merely\n              because the statutory definition of the crime permits it to be\n              committed with a reckless mental state. It is disqualified\n              because the instructions and the non-specific form of verdict\n              . . . did not narrow the mental state of the charge . . . . Had\n              [defendant]\u2019s instructions or form of verdict specified that the\n              mental state for his second degree murder conviction was based\n              on either an intentional or knowing mens rea, the conviction\n              would have qualified, regardless of the fact that the crime\u2019s\n              statutory definition allows for conviction under a lesser mental\n              state.\n\nId.; see also State v. Schackart, 190 Ariz. 238, 247, 947 P.2d 315, 324 (1997) (implying\n\ntrial court might have relied on jury instructions used in obtaining prior conviction to\n\ndetermine violence factor under former \u00a7 13-703(F)(2); supreme court would not consider\n\nevidence because presented for first time on appeal).9\n\n\u00b623           Federal courts have faced similar evidentiary issues when required to determine\n\nwhether a defendant\u2019s prior state conviction warrants sentence enhancement pursuant to the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). See, e.g., Taylor v. United States, 495\n\nU.S. 575, 110 S. Ct. 2143 (1990). Like Arizona, federal courts do not permit review of the\n\n\n       9\n        Schackart; State v. McKinney, 185 Ariz. 567, 917 P.2d 1214 (1996); and State v.\nWalden, 183 Ariz. 595, 905 P.2d 974 (1995), provide some of our supreme court\u2019s more\nrecent statements about how a court may determine whether a conviction qualifies as an\naggravating factor under former \u00a7 13-703(F)(2). Section 13-703(F)(2) was amended in 1993\nto substitute \u201cserious offense, whether preparatory or completed,\u201d defined to include specific\noffenses, for \u201cfelony in the United States involving the use or threat of violence on another\nperson.\u201d 1993 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 153, \u00a7 1.\n\n                                             16\n\funderlying facts to determine the nature of a prior conviction and have held that the federal\n\nenhancement statute \u201cgenerally requires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction\n\nand the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d Id. at 602, 1105 S. Ct. at 2160. However,\n\njust as McKinney and Walden suggest that, in Arizona, jury instructions might be considered\n\nto narrow the elements of a prior conviction, the Supreme Court held in Taylor that a\n\nfederal sentencing court may \u201cgo beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of\n\ncases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements\u201d necessary for the\n\nenhancement factor. 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S. Ct. at 2160. Thus, to establish a prior\n\nconviction for burglary of a building in a state having a burglary statute with broader\n\napplication, the Court held, \u201cif the indictment or information and jury instructions show that\n\nthe defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building, and that the jury necessarily\n\nhad to find an entry of a building to convict, then the Government should be allowed to use\n\nthe conviction for enhancement.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b624           Relevant to our discussion in this case, the Supreme Court has recently\n\nclarified this analysis of federal law and has extended its application to prior state\n\nconvictions arising out of bench trials and guilty pleas. Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S.\n\n13, 16, 19-21, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 1257, 1259-60 (2005). First rejecting the government\u2019s\n\nargument that a court should be permitted to review police reports and complaint\n\napplications to determine the nature of a prior conviction, the Court reaffirmed its decision\n\nin Taylor and held a federal sentencing court may rely only on \u201cconclusive records made\n\n\n                                             17\n\for used in adjudicating guilt.\u201d Id. at 21-24, 1255 S. Ct. at 1260-62. Such records may\n\ninclude charging documents and jury instructions, as set forth in Taylor, and as\n\n              analogs to jury instructions[,] . . . a bench-trial judge\u2019s formal\n              rulings of law and findings of fact, and in pleaded cases[,] . . .\n              the statement of factual basis for the charge, shown by a\n              transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement\n              presented to the court, or by a record of comparable findings of\n              fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.\n\nId. at 20, 125 S. Ct. at 1259-60 (citation omitted). The Court reasoned that by reviewing\n\nthese record documents, a court may be able to determine \u201cwhether the plea had\n\n\u2018necessarily\u2019 rested on\u201d the elements required for enhancement. Id. at 21, 125 S. Ct. at\n\n1260, quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S. Ct. at 2160.\n\n\u00b625           We conclude the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Shepard may be\n\napplicable to cases involving prior Arizona convictions. Although its adoption would be an\n\nextension of current Arizona law, it is consistent with McKinney and Walden and the\n\nunderlying rule for determining the nature of prior Arizona convictions: Recognizing that\n\n\u201c[e]vidence of a prior conviction is reliable, the defendant having had his trial and exercised\n\nhis full panoply of rights which accompany his conviction,\u201d Gillies, 135 Ariz. at 511, 662\n\nP.2d at 1018, a court may \u201cconsider only evidence of the conviction,\u201d State v. Hinchey, 165\n\nAriz. 432, 437, 799 P.2d 352, 357 (1990), and \u201ccannot look behind the [prior] conviction\n\nto determine the true facts of the case,\u201d McKinney, 185 Ariz. at 581, 917 P.2d at 1228. Cf.\n\nRedeker v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 127 P.3d 520, 525-26 (Nev. 2006) (adopting\n\nShepard for Nevada determination of existence of prior conviction \u201cof a felony \u2018involving\n\n                                              18\n\fthe use or threat of violence to the person of another\u2019\u201d; finding \u201cthe approach in Taylor and\n\nShepard answers the concerns about due process . . . identified by the Arizona Supreme\n\nCourt [in Gillies], as well as the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual\n\napproach\u201d), quoting Nev. Rev. Stat. 200.033(2)(b).\n\n\u00b626           We need not decide this issue today, however.           Even if Walden\u2019s rule\n\npermitting consideration of jury instructions to narrow a statutory definition were clearly\n\napplicable to a determination of whether prior convictions were for violent crimes under\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 13-901.01 and 13-604.04, and even if that rule were extended to allow similar review,\n\nin determining the existence of prior convictions resulting from bench trials or pleas of\n\nguilty, of only those \u201cconclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt,\u201d Shepard, 544\n\nU.S. at 21, 125 S. Ct. at 1260, none of the documents suggested by the state meet that\n\nstandard.\n\n\u00b627           First, the charging documents that led to Joyner\u2019s prior convictions, although\n\nreferring to the use of a gun, are not reliable evidence of the elements established by his\n\nconvictions because they were not incorporated by reference in the judgments of conviction.\n\nCf. Thompson, 186 Ariz. at 532, 924 P.2d at 1051. Indeed, as reflected in Joyner\u2019s plea\n\nagreements and judgments for both cases, his prior convictions were for \u201cnondangerous\u201d\n\noffenses, and Joyner\u2019s plea agreements \u201cserve[d] to amend\u201d the charging documents to\n\nconform to his guilty pleas. See State v. Wilson, 126 Ariz. 348, 351-52, 615 P.2d 645, 648-\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f49 (App. 1980). As a result, the charging documents are not reliable evidence of the\n\nelements of Joyner\u2019s convictions.10\n\n\u00b628           The other documentary evidence suggested by the state, including the release\n\npapers and presentence reports prepared for Joyner\u2019s prior convictions, although suggestive\n\nof the facts underlying his prior crimes, do not prove what statutory elements were\n\nestablished by the judgments of conviction. Nor is the sentencing court\u2019s direction in the\n\narmed robbery sentencing minute entry that Joyner \u201cforfeit the firearm related to this cause\u201d\n\nthe kind of conclusive record that would reliably narrow the basis for Joyner\u2019s armed\n\nrobbery conviction. In addition, transcripts of Joyner\u2019s plea colloquys for the prior\n\nconvictions were not provided to the trial court and are not included in the record on appeal.\n\n\u00b629           Thus, the state failed to establish that Joyner has a prior conviction for a\n\nviolent crime under \u00a7 13-901.01(B). Accordingly, Joyner was entitled to suspension of the\n\nimposition of sentence and placement on mandatory probation for his possession offenses.11\n\n\n       10\n         The title of Joyner\u2019s armed robbery information stated that the offense was a\ndangerous felony, but the information did not include allegations of dangerousness pursuant\nto \u00a7 13-604. If the dangerous nature of the armed robbery had been properly alleged and\nproved and ultimately incorporated in the judgment of conviction for that offense, the court\ncould have relied on the judgment because, \u201c[a]lthough \u2018dangerous\u2019 and \u2018violent\u2019 are\nseparate concepts, they share a similar definition.\u201d State v. Benak, 199 Ariz. 333, \u00b6 7, 18\nP.3d 127, 129 (App. 2001) (construing \u00a7 13-604.04). Joyner\u2019s armed robbery plea\nagreement expressly provided that any allegation of dangerousness was \u201cdismissed or, if not\nyet filed, shall not be brought.\u201d\n       11\n         We reject the state\u2019s suggestion that, under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-702(C)(11), \u201ca court may\ntake into account all the defendant\u2019s criminal activity and history in determining sentences,\neven if the defendant has not been convicted or charged for that conduct.\u201d The trial court\n\n                                             20\n\fSee \u00a7 13-901.01(A). Because this provision is mandatory, Joyner\u2019s prison sentences are\n\nillegal, see State v. Carbajal, 184 Ariz. 117, 118, 907 P.2d 503, 504 (App. 1995), and\n\ntherefore, the error is fundamental, see State v. Thues, 203 Ariz. 339, \u00b6 4, 54 P.3d 368, 369\n\n(App. 2002).\n\nd.     Prejudice\n\n\u00b630            The state asserts Joyner cannot establish the prejudice required by State v.\n\nHenderson, 210 Ariz. 561, \u00b6 20, 115 P.3d 601, 607 (2005), because he cannot \u201cshow that\n\nhe, in particular, did not use a gun\u201d during the armed robbery and attempted armed robbery\n\nhe committed in 2000. We read Henderson differently.\n\n\u00b631            To establish that a fundamental error is also prejudicial, a defendant must\n\nshow that, but for the error, a reasonable fact-finder \u201ccould have reached a different result.\u201d\n\nId. \u00b6 27. In this case, the state bore the burden of proving both the existence of a prior\n\nconviction and its violent nature. See Foster v. Irwin, 196 Ariz. 230, \u00b6 8, 995 P.2d 272, 275\n\n(2000) (\u201cThe state did not brief or argue . . . whether Foster\u2019s conviction for evading police\n\nwas a violent crime. Thus, his only prior felony conviction does not remove Foster from the\n\nmandatory probation requirement of \u00a7 13-901.01.\u201d); cf. State v. Rodriguez, 200 Ariz. 105,\n\n\u00b6 5, 23 P.3d 100, 101 (App. 2001) (\u201cagree[ing] with the state\u2019s concession of error\u201d that\n\n\n\n\ndid not aggravate Joyner\u2019s sentences pursuant to \u00a7 13-702. To find a defendant ineligible\nfor mandatory probation under \u00a7 13-901.01(B), a court must find the defendant has a prior\nconviction or is currently under indictment for a violent crime as defined in \u00a7 13-604.04.\nState v. Gomez, 212 Ariz. 55, \u00b6 29, 127 P.3d 873, 878 (2006).\n\n                                              21\n\fevidence of prior convictions for drug offenses was insufficient). Henderson does not shift\n\nthis burden or require Joyner to disprove what the state failed to prove. Cf. State v.\n\nMorales, No. CR-06-0374-PR, \u00b6 12, 2007 WL 1345384 at *3 (Ariz. May 8, 2007)\n\n(stipulation of prior convictions entered without voluntariness determination fundamental\n\nerror; defendant not required to show absence of prior convictions to establish prejudice\n\nbecause such requirement would relieve state of burden of proof).\n\n\u00b632           On this record, the trial court erred by finding that Joyner had a prior\n\nconviction for a violent crime. But for this error, Joyner would have been placed on\n\nprobation for the possession convictions. Instead, he was sentenced to an eight-year prison\n\nterm and two, concurrent, 3.75-year prison terms. Joyner has shown prejudice.\n\n                Reliance on Prior Convictions for Enhanced Sentence\n\n\u00b633           Joyner also argues that none of his convictions should have resulted in\n\nenhanced prison terms because neither the judge nor the jury expressly found that his prior\n\nconvictions constitute historical prior felony convictions under former A.R.S.\n\n\u00a7 13-604(V)(2), now (W)(2). See 2003 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 11, \u00a7 1; 2005 Ariz. Sess. Laws,\n\nch. 188, \u00a7 1. We find no prejudicial error in the trial court\u2019s reliance on Joyner\u2019s prior\n\nconvictions to enhance his sentence for resisting arrest. Although Joyner is correct that the\n\nverdict forms for the prior convictions did not include the offense dates, the verdicts\n\nspecifically identified the county in which the convictions were entered and the cause\n\nnumber of each conviction. Certified copies of the conviction records for those cause\n\n\n                                             22\n\fnumbers were admitted into evidence and established that Joyner\u2019s prior offenses were\n\ncommitted in 2000 and led to two convictions, one for armed robbery, a class two felony,\n\nand another for attempted armed robbery, a class three felony. Joyner never challenged the\n\nadmission or veracity of these documents. We disagree with Joyner\u2019s assertion that the jury\n\nwas required to expressly find the prior convictions constituted historical prior felony\n\nconvictions under \u00a7 13-604(W)(2). As Joyner notes, \u00a7 13-604(P) provides that only a trial\n\ncourt may find that prior convictions constitute historical prior felony convictions. That\n\ndetermination requires the court to apply the statutory provisions to the facts of the prior\n\nconvictions. Joyner\u2019s prior convictions unequivocally fall within the provisions of \u00a7 13-\n\n604(W)(2)(b). Joyner was therefore correctly sentenced on his conviction for resisting arrest\n\npursuant to \u00a7 13-604(C). We find no fundamental error in this sentence.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n\u00b634           For the reasons stated, we affirm Joyner\u2019s convictions and his sentence for\n\nresisting arrest, but vacate his sentences for possession of a narcotic drug, possession of\n\nmarijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia and remand the case to the trial court for\n\nresentencing on those convictions.\n\n\n\n                                              ____________________________________\n                                              GARYE L.
