He also pled guilty to separate charges of robbery and aggravated\nrobbery. The trial court imposed ten-year sentences for each aggravated robbery\nconviction and a six-year sentence for the robbery conviction.

App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nROBERT L. HOLLOWAY, JR., J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which J. ROSS DYER\nand KYLE A. HIXSON, JJ., joined.\n\nAlexander D. Camp, Jackson, Tennessee, for the appellant, Jamarcus Dequan Murdock.\n\nHerbert H. Slatery III, Attorney General and Reporter; Benjamin A. Ball, Senior Assistant\nAttorney General; Mark E. Davidson, District Attorney General; and Joe Van Dyke,\nAssistant District Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\f                                                 OPINION\n\n                                Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Defendant was indicted on four counts of aggravated robbery: in counts one and\ntwo with the December 9, 2017 aggravated robberies of the Ready Mart and Teresa Ann\nMyrick; in count three with the February 27, 2018 aggravated robbery of the Dollar General\nStore in Toone; and in count four with the February 24, 2018 aggravated robbery of the\nWhiteville Food Mart. Jamarcus Dequan Murdock, 2021 WL 1423125, at *1. The trial\ncourt granted Defendant\u2019s motion to sever the offenses, and Defendant subsequently\npleaded guilty as charged in count four. Id.\n\n        Counts one and two proceeded to trial. According to the evidence presented at trial,\nDefendant planned to commit the robbery of the Ready Mart with fourteen-year-old A.M.1\nId. at *3. On the evening of December 9, 2017, Defendant and A.M. entered the store\nwhile wearing hoodies and bandannas to cover a portion of their faces. Id. at *1-3.\nDefendant produced a gun and waved it around while demanding money from the cash\nregister and from Ms. Myrick, a customer. Id. at *1-2. Ms. Myrick testified that she was\n\u201cscared to death\u201d and that she relinquished her money because \u201cmy life was worth more\nthan what little money I had in my pocket.\u201d Id. at *1. A.M., who testified against\nDefendant at trial, denied having a gun and stated that his role was to \u201c[t]ake the money\u201d\nand put it into a bag. Id. at *3. At one point, Defendant\u2019s mask came down, exposing his\nface, and Charlene Hudson, an employee of the store, recognized Defendant as someone\nwhom she had known for a long period of time. Id. at *2. Ms. Myrick and Ms. Hudson\nsubsequently identified Defendant in a photographic lineup as the perpetrator who had the\ngun. Id. at *2.\n\n       Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the jury convicted Defendant of two\ncounts of aggravated robbery as charged in counts one and two. Id. Following the trial\nand pursuant to a plea agreement with the State, Defendant pleaded guilty to the lesser-\nincluded offense of the robbery of the Dollar General Store in count three in exchange for\na Range I, six-year sentence to be served concurrently with the sentences for the three\naggravated robbery convictions. Id. at *1.\n\n       During the sentencing hearing for the aggravated robbery convictions in counts one,\ntwo, and four, neither party presented proof. Id. at *3. The trial court applied, as\nenhancement factors, that Defendant was a leader in the commission of the offenses and\nthat he had no hesitation about committing the offenses when the risk to human life was\nhigh. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(2), (10). With regard to count one, the trial court\n\n       1\n           We will identify the minor by his initials.\n                                                     -2-\n\falso applied as an enhancement factor that the aggravated robbery involved more than one\nvictim. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(3). The trial court applied as a mitigating factor\nthat Defendant \u201cbecause of his youth lacked substantial judgment in committing the\noffenses,\u201d but the trial court found that the enhancement factors \u201cfar\u201d outweighed the\nmitigating factor. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-113(6). The trial court imposed ten-year\nsentences for each of the aggravated robbery convictions. The trial court ordered\nDefendant to serve the sentences for the aggravated robbery convictions in counts one and\ntwo consecutively to each other, finding that Defendant was a dangerous offender. See\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(1). The trial court ordered that the ten-year sentence in\ncount four be served concurrently to the sentences in counts one and two for an effective\ntwenty-year sentence.\n\n       Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\nand the imposition of consecutive sentences for his convictions under counts one and two.\nJamarcus Dequan Murdock, 2021 WL 1423125, at *1. This court concluded that the\nevidence was sufficient to support the convictions but vacated the imposition of\nconsecutive sentences. Id. at *6. This court held that the trial court, in utilizing the\n\u201cdangerous offender\u201d category to impose consecutive sentences, failed to make the\nrequired findings that consecutive sentences are reasonably related to the severity of the\noffenses and are necessary to protect the public from further criminal conduct as required\nby State v. Wilkerson, 905 S.W.2d 933, 937-39 (Tenn. 1995). Jamarcus Dequan Murdock,\n2021 WL 1423125, at *5. After determining that the appellate record was inadequate to\nconduct a de novo review, this court remanded the case to the trial court \u201cfor the\nconsideration of the Wilkerson factors in determining whether consecutive sentencing on\nthe basis of the dangerous offender category is appropriate in this case.\u201d Id.\n\n       At the outset of the resentencing hearing, the trial court incorporated its earlier\nfindings with regard to the sentencing range and stated that the court would specifically\naddress only the issue of consecutive sentencing. Neither party presented additional proof.\nAfter arguments by both parties, the trial court stated it would consider the evidence\npresented at trial, the facts presented at the plea hearing, the presentence report, the\narguments presented at the prior sentencing hearing, and the arguments presented during\nthe hearing on remand. The trial court found that \u201ca handgun, a deadly weapon, was used\nand directed at victims which placed them in grave danger and showed a disregard by\n[Defendant] to human life.\u201d The trial court stated that Defendant \u201ccommitted a crime\nwithout hesitation [and] with risk to human life by pointing a handgun at an individual.\u201d\nThe trial court found that extended, consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the\npublic from further criminal acts by Defendant and were reasonably related to the severity\nof the offenses committed. The trial court found that Defendant was a dangerous offender\nand ordered that the sentences for two of the aggravated robbery convictions run\nconsecutively to each other and concurrently to the sentences for the remaining convictions\n                                           -3-\n\ffor an effective twenty-year sentence. The trial Defendant subsequently filed a motion in\nthis court to accept a late-filed notice of appeal, and this court granted the motion.\n\n                                           Analysis\n\n        On appeal, Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in classifying him as a\n\u201cdangerous offender\u201d and in ordering him to serve his sentences in counts one and two\nconsecutively. Specifically, Defendant contends that he is not a \u201cdangerous offender\u201d\nbecause there was no risk to human life, as the weapon was never discharged, a victim\nidentified the weapon as a pellet gun, and the victims sustained no injuries. The State\ncontends that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in ordering consecutive service\nof Defendant\u2019s sentences.\n\n        When a defendant challenges the length of a sentence, this court reviews the trial\ncourt\u2019s sentencing determinations under an abuse of discretion standard accompanied by a\npresumption of reasonableness. State v. Bise, 380 S.W.3d 682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). \u201cThis\nabuse of discretion standard, accompanied by a presumption of reasonableness, applies to\nwithin-range sentences that reflect a decision based upon the purposes and principles of\nsentencing.\u201d State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 278-79 (Tenn. 2012). A finding of abuse\nof discretion indicates the \u201ctrial court\u2019s logic and reasoning was improper when viewed in\nlight of the factual circumstances and relevant legal principles involved in a particular\ncase.\u201d State v. Shaffer, 45 S.W.3d 553, 555 (Tenn. 2001). A trial court has not abused its\ndiscretion unless \u201cthe record [is] void of any substantial evidence that would support the\ntrial court\u2019s decision.\u201d Id.\n\n       \u201cIn the context of consecutive sentencing, the presumption of reasonableness\napplies similarly, giving deference to the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretionary authority\nto impose consecutive sentences if it has provided reasons on the record establishing at\nleast one of the seven grounds listed in Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b).\u201d\nState v. Pollard, 432 S.W.3d 851, 861 (Tenn. 2013). The trial court may impose\nconsecutive sentences upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201c[t]he\ndefendant is a dangerous offender whose behavior indicates little or no regard for human\nlife and no hesitation about committing a crime in which the risk to human life is high[.]\u201d\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(4). However, although \u201c[p]roof that an offender\u2019s\nbehavior indicated little or no regard for human life and no hesitation about committing a\ncrime in which the risk to human life was high\u201d is proof that an offender is a dangerous\noffender, \u201cit may not be sufficient to sustain consecutive sentences.\u201d Pollard, 432 S.W.3d\nat 863 (citing State v. Wilkerson, 905 S.W.2d 933, 938 (Tenn. 1995)). Thus, in order to\nimpose consecutive sentences based upon the dangerous offender classification, \u201ctrial\ncourts must conclude that the evidence has established that the aggregate sentence is\n\u2018reasonably related to the severity of the offenses\u2019 and \u2018necessary in order to protect the\n                                             -4-\n\fpublic from further criminal acts.\u2019\u201d Id. at 863 (citing Wilkerson, 905 S.W.2d at 938); see\nState v. Lane, 3 S.W.3d 456, 461 (Tenn. 1999) (recognizing that two additional findings\nmust be made prior to ordering consecutive sentences only under the dangerous offender\ncategory).\n\n        The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings that Defendant was a dangerous\noffender whose behavior indicates little to no regard for human life and who had no\nhesitation about committing a crime in which the risk to human life was high and that\nconsecutive sentencing was reasonably related to the severity of the offenses committed\nand was necessary to protect the public from further criminal acts by Defendant. See Tenn.\nCode Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(4); Wilkerson, 905 S.W.2d at 938. The aggravated robberies\nagainst Ms. Myrick and Ready Mart did not involve an isolated incident. Rather,\nDefendant committed a string of robberies in a relatively short amount of time. With regard\nto counts one and two, Defendant pointed a deadly weapon at two unarmed victims in a\nconvenience store during robberies that he planned and persuaded a fourteen-year-old to\nassist in committing.\n\n       Defendant relies upon this court\u2019s decision in State v. Eric D. Thomas, in which this\ncourt held that the trial court erred in finding that the defendant was a dangerous offender\nand in ordering that his sentences for his four robbery convictions be served consecutively.\nNo. W1999-00337-CCA-R3-CD, 2001 WL 721054, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 26,\n2001). This court concluded that, although the defendant \u201capparently threatened the\nvictims with violence, he did not cause any injuries and was not armed.\u201d Id. As the State\nargues in its brief, this court\u2019s opinion in Eric D. Thomas, in which this court conducted a\nde novo review of the defendant\u2019s sentence, predates the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s\nopinions in Bise and Pollard, which requires that this court review for an abuse of\ndiscretion. Furthermore, unlike the unarmed defendant in Eric D. Thomas, the trial court\nfound that Defendant in the present case was armed when he committed the aggravated\nrobberies.\n\n        We conclude that the trial court made the necessary findings required by Wilkerson\nand acted within its discretion in imposing partial consecutive sentences. Defendant is not\nentitled to relief.\n\n                                       Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the trial court are affirmed.\n\n\n                                             ____________________________________\n                                             ROBERT L.
