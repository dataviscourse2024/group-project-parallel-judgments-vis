The matter\n\ncame on for trial during the 5 October 2009 criminal session of\n\nSampson County Superior Court, the Honorable Russell J. Lanier,\n\nJr., Judge presiding.\n\n    The State\u2019s evidence tended to show the following.                     On 22\n\nMay 2007, Timothy Johnson was walking home after midnight when\n\nhe saw defendant and two friends standing on a street corner.\n\nJohnson recognized the men from the neighborhood and knew one of\n\ndefendant\u2019s associates by the name \u201cEarl.\u201d\n\n    When Earl called out to him, Johnson walked over to the\n\ngroup.       Defendant approached Johnson and struck him in the face.\n\nJohnson returned the blow, knocking defendant to the ground, and\n\nwas set upon by defendant\u2019s associates.                Johnson fell down and\n\nwas hit and kicked by the three men.                  When Johnson stood up,\n\nEarl \u201csnatched\u201d $7 from his pocket.                Johnson began to run and\n\nheard    a    popping   sound.     He    turned   around   and   saw    defendant\n\nfiring at him with a handgun.                  Johnson \u201cran straight to the\n\nhouse\u201d and had his girlfriend drive him to the police station.\n\n    On 7 October 2009, a jury found defendant guilty of common-\n\nlaw robbery and not guilty of possession of a firearm by a\n\f                                             -3-\n\n\nconvicted felon.              The trial court sentenced             defendant    to an\n\nactive    prison      term     of   sixteen    to   twenty     months.       Defendant\n\nappeals.\n\n                              _____________________________\n\n    In     his    sole    argument      on    appeal,     defendant    contends      the\n\ntrial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss at the close\n\nof the State\u2019s evidence.            We disagree.\n\n    \u201cUpon review of a motion to dismiss, the court determines\n\nwhether there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the State, of each essential element of the offense\n\ncharged    and    of     the    defendant      being    the    perpetrator      of   the\n\noffense.\u201d        State v. Lane, 163 N.C. App. 495, 499, 594 S.E.2d\n\n107, 110 (2004) (citations omitted).                    \u201cSubstantial evidence is\n\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n\nadequate to support a conclusion.\u201d                     State v. Brown, 310 N.C.\n\n563, 566, 313 S.E.2d 585, 587 (1984) (citing State v.

Hill, 365 N.C. 273, 275, 715 S.E.2d 841,\n\n843 (2011) (citation and quotation omitted).                        If the evidence\n\f                                         -4-\n\n\n\u201cis sufficient only to raise a suspicion or conjecture as to\n\neither the commission of the offense, or the identity of the\n\ndefendant     as   the   perpetrator      of    it,     the    motion       for    nonsuit\n\nshould be allowed.         This is true even though the suspicion so\n\naroused by the evidence is strong.\u201d               In re Vinson, 298 N.C. 640,\n\n656\u201457, 260 S.E.2d 591, 602 (1979) (citation omitted).\n\n      \u201cCommon      law   robbery   is    defined       as   \u2018the     felonious,       non-\n\nconsensual taking of money or personal property from the person\n\nor presence of another by means of violence or fear.\u2019\u201d                            State v.\n\nJones, 339 N.C. 114, 164, 451 S.E.2d 826, 854 (1994) (quoting\n\nSmith, 305 N.C. at 700, 292 S.E.2d at 270).                        Under the doctrine\n\nof    concerted     action,     \u201c[a]    person        may     be    found    guilty     of\n\ncommitting a crime if he is at the scene acting together with\n\nanother person with a common plan to commit the crime, although\n\nthe   other   person     does   all     the    acts    necessary      to     commit    the\n\ncrime.\u201d     State v. Jefferies, 333 N.C. 501, 512, 428 S.E.2d 150,\n\n156 (1993) (citing State v. Joyner, 297 N.C. 349, 255 S.E.2d 390\n\n(1979)).      To sustain a conviction, the evidence must show that\n\nthe defendant (1) was present at the scene of the crime and (2)\n\n\u201cact[ed] together with another who does the acts necessary to\n\nconstitute the crime pursuant to a common plan or purpose.\u201d\n\nState v. Wallace, 104 N.C. App. 498, 504, 410 S.E.2d 226, 230\n\f                                             -5-\n\n\n(1991) (citing         State v. Williams, 299 N.C. 652, 656\u201457, 263\n\nS.E.2d    774,       777\u201478     (1980)).            Moreover,       the        fact   that     a\n\n\u201cdefendant did some act forming a part of the crime charged\n\nwould    be    strong      evidence     that        he   was   acting      together       with\n\nanother       who    did      other     acts        leading      toward        the    crimes\u2019\n\ncommission.\u201d         Joyner, 297 N.C. at 356\u201457, 255 S.E.2d at 395.\n\n      Defendant       argues     the    trial        court     erred      in    denying      his\n\nmotion to dismiss because the evidence was insufficient to show\n\nthat he acted in concert with Earl in robbing Johnson.                                  While\n\nconceding      the    evidence        may    have    shown     a    common       purpose     to\n\nassault       Johnson,     defendant        contends      that      it    raises      only    a\n\nsuspicion      or    conjecture       that     he    shared     a   common       purpose     to\n\ncommit the robbery.\n\n      In State v. Ikard, the defendant sat in the back seat of a\n\nvehicle with three men and the victim.                       State v. Ikard, 71 N.C.\n\nApp. 283, 284, 321 S.E.2d 535, 536 (1984).                               When the vehicle\n\nstopped, the defendant and his three associates exited.                                      Id.\n\nThe defendant walked 20\u201325 feet away from the vehicle taking\n\nwith him the victim\u2019s radio.                 Id.     When the victim requested the\n\nradio, two of the defendant\u2019s associates returned to the car.\n\nId.     One of them threatened the victim with a shotgun while the\n\nother took $18 from the victim\u2019s wallet.                            Id.        Finding this\n\f                                   -6-\n\n\nevidence insufficient to support concerted action for common law\n\nrobbery, this Court noted that:\n\n       The State introduced no evidence tending to show\n       that defendant knew that his companions were\n       going to rob Mr. Anderson . . . . Nor was there\n       any evidence tending to show that defendant\n       encouraged the other men in the commission of the\n       crime, or that he by word or deed indicated to\n       them that he stood prepared to render assistance.\n       The most that can be said on this evidence is\n       that defendant was present when the crime was\n       committed, and this is insufficient to take the\n       case to the jury.\n\nId. at 285\u201486, 321 S.E.2d at 537.\n\n    Here, taken in the light most favorable to the State, there\n\nis substantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably\n\ninfer that defendant and Earl joined in a common purpose to rob\n\nJohnson.   Defendant was not just \u201cpresent\u201d during the robbery;\n\nhe acted \u201cin conjunction\u201d with Earl.         Joyner, 297 N.C. at 356,\n\n255 S.E.2d at 395.      Unlike the defendant in Ikard, defendant was\n\nboth \u201cprepared\u201d to and did \u201crender assistance.\u201d            Ikard, 71 N.C.\n\nApp. at 285\u201486, 321 S.E.2d at 537.               Defendant initiated the\n\nphysical   encounter,    struck   Johnson   in    the   face,   and   kicked\n\nJohnson while Johnson was on the ground.            Defendant also ended\n\nthe physical encounter by firing his             handgun as Johnson was\n\nrunning away.\n\n    In contrast to Ikard, the assault and robbery of Johnson\n\f                                        -7-\n\n\nwere not \u201cdistinct and separate\u201d acts.                 State v. Lambert, 149\n\nN.C. App. 163, 167, 560 S.E.2d 221, 224 (2002).                       Defendant\u2019s\n\nassault   of   Johnson     gave    Earl    an     opportunity    to   reach   into\n\nJohnson\u2019s pocket.        As such, defendant was not separated from the\n\nlocation of the robbery, see Ikard, 71 N.C. App. at 284\u201486, 321\n\nS.E.2d    at   536\u201437,     nor    was     there    significant    time   between\n\ndefendant\u2019s and Earl\u2019s actions.               See Lambert, 149 N.C. App. at\n\n167, 560 S.E.2d at 224 (noting \u201cno separation by either time or\n\nproximity between the [defendant\u2019s] bottle-throwing\u201d attacks and\n\nhis associates beating the victim to death with a tree limb).\n\nThe evidence thus supports a reasonable inference that defendant\n\nwas trying to disable Johnson so Earl could take money from him,\n\nand afterwards encouraged Johnson to flee by shooting at him.\n\nAccordingly, defendant\u2019s argument is overruled.\n\n    No error.\n\n    Judges STROUD and HUNTER, Robert N., Jr., concur.\n\n    Report per Rule 30(e).\n\f",
