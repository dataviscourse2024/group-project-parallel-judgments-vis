GREG TAYLOR, JR. v. THE STATE.\n\n      In 2012, Greg Taylor, Jr., pleaded guilty to armed robbery and aggravated\nassault. In March 2023, proceeding pro se, Taylor filed a motion to vacate his\ncriminal conviction, asserting that it was void. The trial court dismissed his motion,\nand Taylor filed this appeal. We lack jurisdiction.\n      First, a post-conviction motion seeking to vacate an allegedly void conviction\nis not a valid procedure in a criminal case, and any appeal from the denial or\ndismissal of such a motion must be dismissed. See Williams v. State, 287 Ga. 192,\n192 (695 SE2d 244) (2010); Roberts v. State, 286 Ga. 532, 532 (690 SE2d 150)\n(2010).\n      Second, Taylor\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely. A notice of appeal must be filed\nwithin 30 days after entry of the order to be appealed. OCGA \u00a7 5-6-38 (a). The proper\nand timely filing of a notice of appeal is an absolute requirement to confer jurisdiction\non this Court. Rowland v. State, 264 Ga. 872, 872 (1) (452 SE2d 756) (1995). Here,\nthe trial court dismissed Taylor\u2019s motion on May 5, 2023, and he filed this appeal on\nJune 20, 2023, 46 days later.\n      For these reasons, we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal, which is hereby\nDISMISSED.\n\n                                         Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\n                                                Clerk\u2019s Office, Atlanta,____________________\n                                                                          11/07/2023\n                                                I certify that the above is a true extract from\n                                         the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\n                                                 Witness my signature and the seal of said court\n                                         hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\n\n\n                                                                                        , Clerk.\n\f",
