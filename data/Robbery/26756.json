UNITED STATES                      3\n\n                         OPINION\n\nPAEZ, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Joshua Allen Ward challenges his mandatory sentence\nunder the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 924(e). He argues on appeal that the district court\nerroneously determined that his prior Minnesota state\nconviction for aiding and abetting simple robbery under\nMinn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 609.24 is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the\nACCA\u2019s force clause. Because the minimum force required\nto sustain a Minnesota simple robbery \u201cincludes the amount\nof force necessary to overcome a victim\u2019s resistance,\u201d\nStokeling v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 544, 555 (2019), we\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n    Ward was convicted in 2012 of one count of unlawful\npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).\nThe ACCA provides that a person who violates \u00a7 922(g)(1)\nand who has \u201cthree previous convictions\u201d for a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d shall be imprisoned for a minimum of 15 years. 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).       Over Ward\u2019s objection to his\ndesignation as an \u201carmed career criminal,\u201d the district court\nsentenced him to the 15-year mandatory minimum.\n\n    In 2015, the Supreme Court held that the ACCA\u2019s\nresidual     clause     under      \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)       was\nunconstitutionally vague. See Johnson v. United States,\n135 S. Ct. 2551, 2555\u201357 (2015) (\u201cJohnson II\u201d).\nSubsequently, in Welch v. United States, the Court held that\nJohnson II applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.\n136 S. Ct. 1257, 1268 (2016).\n\f4                 WARD V. UNITED STATES\n\n    In 2016, Ward filed a motion in the district court\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a) to vacate his sentence based\non Johnson II. He argued that his prior convictions for\nburglary, aiding and abetting simple robbery, second-degree\nassault, and aggravated assault, fell under the invalidated\nresidual clause of the ACCA and that he was therefore\nwrongfully sentenced. The government conceded that\nWard\u2019s two Minnesota burglary convictions did not qualify\nas violent felonies under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) but maintained\nthat Ward\u2019s three other convictions qualified as predicate\nACCA offenses. The district court agreed and denied\nWard\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence. The district court\ngranted Ward\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability\nbased on \u201cvarying interpretations by other courts\u201d regarding\nhis conviction for aiding and abetting Minnesota simple\nrobbery. Ward timely appealed.\n\n                              II.\n\n    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253(c) and\n2255(d). The limited issue before us, which we review de\nnovo, is whether Ward\u2019s Minnesota conviction for aiding\nand abetting simple robbery qualifies as a predicate violent\nfelony for sentencing purposes under the ACCA. See United\nStates v. Parnell, 818 F.3d 974, 978 (9th Cir. 2016).\n\n                              III.\n\n      The ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\n. . . that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of\nanother; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, [or] involves\nuse of explosives . . . .\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Prior to\nJohnson II, 135 S. Ct. at 2556\u201357, crimes that \u201cotherwise\ninvolve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\n\f                    WARD V. UNITED STATES                             5\n\nphysical injury to another\u201d also constituted \u201cviolent\nfelonies\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2014known as the\n\u201cresidual clause.\u201d The Supreme Court, however, invalidated\nthe ACCA residual clause as void for vagueness. See\nJohnson II, 135 S. Ct. at 2555, 2563. Thus, Ward\u2019s prior\nconviction for simple robbery is a predicate offense only if\nit falls under either the \u201cforce clause\u201d (also known as the\n\u201celements clause\u201d) of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) or the \u201cenumerated\noffenses clause\u201d of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The parties agree that\nthe only issue we must decide is whether Minnesota simple\nrobbery categorically involves \u201cphysical force\u201d within the\nmeaning of the ACCA\u2019s force clause. 1\n\n                                  A.\n\n    We apply the familiar categorical approach, as outlined\nin Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), to determine\nwhether a state offense is a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s\nforce clause. See, e.g., Parnell, 818 F.3d at 978. In doing\nso, we ask \u201cwhether the conduct proscribed by the statute\nnecessarily involves \u2018the use, attempted use, or threatened\nuse of physical force against the person of another.\u2019\u201d United\nStates v. Geozos, 870 F.3d 890, 898 (9th Cir. 2017)\n(emphasis added) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)).\nPrior to Johnson II, the Supreme Court held that \u201cin the\ncontext of a statutory definition of \u2018violent felony,\u2019 the\n\n     1\n       In his supplemental post-argument brief, Ward raised a new claim\nregarding the mens rea required in Minnesota\u2019s aiding and abetting\nstatute. Although \u201cparties are not limited to the precise arguments they\nmade below,\u201d Thompson v. Runnels, 705 F.3d 1089, 1098 (9th Cir. 2013)\n(quoting Lebron v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 379\n(1995)), this appears to raise a new claim rather than a new argument,\nsee United States v. Pallares-Galan, 359 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(\u201c[I]t is claims that are deemed waived or forfeited, not arguments.\u201d).\nWe therefore consider the claim waived and do not address it.\n\f6                 WARD V. UNITED STATES\n\nphrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means violent force\u2014that is, force\ncapable of causing physical pain or injury to another.\u201d\nJohnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 140 (2010)\n(\u201cJohnson I\u201d). Thus, under Johnson I, the force element of\na predicate conviction must entail more than just the\n\u201cslightest offensive touching.\u201d Id. at 139\u201341.\n\n    Applying Johnson I, we have held that \u201c\u2018violent\u2019 force\nmust be \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018strong,\u2019\u201d and that \u201c[t]he mere\npotential for some trivial pain or slight injury will not\nsuffice.\u201d United States v. Walton, 881 F.3d 768, 773 (9th\nCir. 2018) (quoting Johnson I, 559 U.S. at 140); see id. at\n774 (holding that Alabama armed robbery is not a violent\nfelony under the ACCA); see also United States v. Molinar,\n876 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 2017), amended, 881 F.3d 1064,\n1069\u201370 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that Arizona armed\nrobbery is not a crime of violence under the Sentencing\nGuideline\u2019s force clause). This approach diverges from the\none adopted by several of our sister circuits, like the Seventh\nand Eighth Circuits, which look to Justice Scalia\u2019s\nconcurrence in United States v. Castleman, 572 U.S. 157,\n173\u201384 (2014), to suggest that \u201cany number of forceful acts\nbeyond simple touching\u201d may \u201cqualify as violent force in the\nsense that they have the capacity to inflict physical pain, if\nnot concrete physical injury, upon the victim.\u201d United States\nv. Jennings, 860 F.3d 450, 457 (7th Cir. 2017); see also\nUnited States v. Pettis, 888 F.3d 962, 966 (8th Cir. 2018)\n(reaffirming that physical force under the ACCA\nencompasses \u201ca jostle accompanied by a forceful pull\u2014like\n[a] \u2018blind-side bump, brief struggle, and yank\u2019 . . . [and]\n\u2018involves a use of force that is capable of inflicting pain\u2019\u201d).\n\n    Recently, the Supreme Court clarified that for robbery\noffenses, the \u201cphysical force\u201d element under the ACCA\n\u201cincludes the amount of force necessary to overcome a\n\f                 WARD V. UNITED STATES                      7\n\nvictim\u2019s resistance.\u201d Stokeling, 139 S. Ct. at 555. Thus,\nFlorida robbery\u2014defined as the taking of property with the\nuse of force to overcome the resistance by the victim\u2014\nqualifies as an ACCA violent felony. Id. at 549, 555.\n\n     In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on the\ncommon law understanding of robbery as \u201can unlawful\ntaking . . . [which] involved \u2018violence.\u2019\u201d Id. at 550. It\nhighlighted a few illustrative examples of common law\nrobbery: \u201cit was robbery \u2018to seize another\u2019s watch or purse,\nand use sufficient force to break a chain or guard by which\nit is attached to his person, or to run against another, or\nrudely push him about, for the purpose of diverting his\nattention and robbing him.\u2019\u201d Id. \u201cSimilarly, it was robbery\nto pull a diamond pin out of a woman\u2019s hair when doing so\ntore away hair attached to the pin.\u201d Id. In common law\nrobbery, the core concern was whether the defendant applied\nforce\u2014any degree of force\u2014that was sufficient to overcome\na victim\u2019s resistance, \u201chowever slight.\u201d Id. at 551. The\nCourt then concluded that Congress adopted the common\nlaw meaning of \u201cforce\u201d for robbery in the force clause of the\nACCA. Id.; see also id. at 551\u201352 (\u201cBy replacing robbery\nas an enumerated offense with a clause that has \u2018force\u2019 as its\ntouchstone, Congress made clear that \u2018force\u2019 retained the\nsame common-law definition that undergirded the original\ndefinition of robbery adopted a mere two years earlier.\u201d).\nThis conclusion was \u201cbuttressed\u201d by the fact that a\nsignificant majority of states defined nonaggravated robbery\nas requiring force that overcomes a victim\u2019s resistance. Id.\nat 552.\n\n    Notably, the Court explained that its holding regarding\nFlorida robbery was consistent with Johnson I, which\naddressed common law misdemeanor battery. Id. (citing\nJohnson I, 559 U.S. at 138). The Court differentiated the\n\f8                    WARD V. UNITED STATES\n\nforce necessary for common law battery from that necessary\nfor common law robbery. See id. at 552\u201353. While the\nformer \u201cdoes not require resistance or even physical aversion\non the part of the victim,\u201d the latter involves\n\u201coverpower[ing] a victim\u2019s will\u201d and necessarily involves a\nphysical confrontation and struggle.\u201d Id. at 553.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   With Stokeling in mind, we turn to Minnesota simple\nrobbery, which is defined as:\n\n         Whoever, having knowledge of not being\n         entitled thereto, takes personal property from\n         the person or in the presence of another and\n         uses or threatens the imminent use of force\n         against any person to overcome the person\u2019s\n         resistance or powers of resistance to, or to\n         compel acquiescence in, the taking or\n         carrying away of the property is guilty of\n         robbery.\n\nMinn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 609.24 (1986). The statute is satisfied\nwhen \u201cthe use of force or threats precede[s] or\naccompan[ies] either the taking or the carrying away\u201d of the\nproperty \u201cand that the force or threats be used to overcome\nthe victim\u2019s resistance or compel his acquiescence . . . .\u201d 2\nState v. Kvale, 302 N.W.2d 650, 653 (Minn. 1981).\n\n\n    2\n       Ward does not argue, and we have found no cases holding, that\nthere is any difference between the force used to overcome a victim\u2019s\nresistance and force used to compel a victim\u2019s acquiescence in the\ncontext of Minnesota simple robbery. The Eighth Circuit also appears\nto have made no such distinction between these two provisions in the\nstatute. See United States v. Libby, 880 F.3d 1011, 1015 (8th Cir. 2018).\n\f                     WARD V. UNITED STATES                               9\n\n      Under our pre-Stokeling case law, Minnesota simple\nrobbery would not be a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s\nforce clause because we differentiated between minimal and\nsubstantial force, even when the minimal force involved was\nsufficient to overcome a victim\u2019s resistance. See Molinar,\n881 F.3d at 1069\u201370 (holding that \u201ca conviction for\nrobbery\u2014or armed robbery\u2014in Arizona does not require\nthe threat or use of Johnson-level force\u201d where the \u201cstatutory\ndefinition of \u2018force\u2019 has not been narrowed . . . other than by\nclarifying that the force must be \u2018intended to overpower the\nparty robbed\u2019\u201d); Geozos, 870 F.3d at 900\u201301 (holding that\nFlorida robbery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13, the same statute at\nissue in Stokeling, is not an ACCA violent felony because\n\u201cthe Florida statute requires that the victim resist the force\n. . . [but does not] require[] that the force used be violent\nforce\u201d).\n\n    Our prior distinction between \u201csubstantial\u201d and\n\u201cminimal\u201d force in the ACCA robbery context in such cases\nas Molinar and Geozos cannot be reconciled with the\nSupreme Court\u2019s clear holding in Stokeling. 3 Compare\nGeozos, 870 F.3d at 900 (\u201cUnder Florida law, then, a person\nwho engages in a non-violent tug-of-war with a victim over\nthe victim\u2019s purse has committed robbery . . . [but]\n[a]ccording to our precedent, such an act does not involve\n\n    3\n      Conversely, our precedent differentiating between intentional and\nreckless or negligent conduct has not been affected by Stokeling. \u201c[T]o\nqualify as defining a violent felony, a state statute must require that the\nphysical force be inflicted intentionally, as opposed to recklessly or\nnegligently.\u201d United States v. Lawrence, 627 F.3d 1281, 1284 (9th Cir.\n2010) (emphasis added) (citing Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d\n1121, 1132 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc)), overruled on other grounds by\nDescamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254 (2013); see also United States\nv. Dixon, 805 F.3d 1193, 1197\u201398 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\f10                    WARD V. UNITED STATES\n\nthe use of violent force within the meaning of ACCA[.]\u201d),\nwith Stokeling, 139 S. Ct. at 553 (\u201c[T]he force necessary to\novercome a victim\u2019s physical resistance is inherently\n\u2018violent\u2019 . . . .\u201d). Thus, to the extent our precedent regarding\nrobberies is irreconcilable with Stokeling, those cases are\neffectively overruled. 4 See Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889,\n893 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (\u201c[W]here the reasoning or\ntheory of our prior circuit authority is clearly irreconcilable\nwith the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority,\na three-judge panel should consider itself bound by the later\nand controlling authority, and should reject the prior circuit\nopinion as having been effectively overruled.\u201d).\n\n    This case, therefore, presents a straightforward\napplication of Stokeling. Minnesota simple robbery is\ndefined as the use or threatened use of force \u201cto overcome\nthe person\u2019s resistance or powers of resistance . . . .\u201d Minn.\nStat. Ann. \u00a7 609.24 (1986). The Minnesota Supreme Court\nhas unequivocally stated that \u201c[a]lthough a simple purse\nsnatching usually constitutes theft, pushing or grabbing a\nperson during that theft may constitute simple robbery.\u201d\n\n     4\n        Importantly, Stokeling made clear that force involved in\nsnatchings, where there is no resistance, is not sufficient to fall under the\nACCA\u2019s force clause. 139 S. Ct. at 555 (differentiating between\nFlorida\u2019s robbery statute and \u201c[m]ere \u2018snatching of property from\nanother\u2019\u201d); see also United States v. Fultz, 923 F.3d 1192, 1196 & n.2\n(9th Cir. 2019) (noting that Stokeling does not reach conduct like\nsnatching). In several recent memorandum dispositions, we have also\nrecognized instances of force that did not fall within \u201cthe scope of the\nelements clause as defined in Stokeling.\u201d United States v. Lawrence,\n758 F. App\u2019x 624, 625 (9th Cir. 2019); see also Torres v. Whitaker,\n752 F. App\u2019x 512, 513 & n.1 (9th Cir. 2019). Thus, to whatever extent\nthe state statutes discussed in Molinar and other ACCA robbery cases\ncriminalize force more broadly than in Stokeling, those cases have not\nbeen overruled. See Lawrence, 758 F. App\u2019x at 625 (reaffirming United\nStates v. Strickland, 860 F.3d 1224 (9th Cir. 2017)).\n\f                 WARD V. UNITED STATES                     11\n\nState v. Slaughter, 691 N.W.2d 70, 76 (Minn. 2005) (citing\nState v. Nash, 339 N.W.2d 554, 557 (Minn. 1983)). Thus,\nMinnesota\u2019s statute is similar to the Florida robbery at issue\nin Stokeling, which is also defined as the taking of property\nwith the use of force to overcome the victim\u2019s resistance.\nSee 139 S. Ct. at 549, 555; see also Taylor v. United States,\n926 F.3d 939, 941\u201342 (8th Cir. 2019) (reaffirming that\nMinnesota simple robbery is an ACCA violent felony and\nnoting that \u201cMinnesota\u2019s simple robbery statute is virtually\nindistinguishable from the Florida statute at issue in\nStokeling\u201d because \u201c[i]n both States, a mere \u2018snatching\u2019 of\nproperty, without more, is not the level of force required\u201d).\n\n                             IV.\n\n   For the reasons above, we affirm the district court\u2019s\ndenial of Ward\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence.\n\n   AFFIRMED.\n\f",
