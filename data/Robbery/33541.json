Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for attempted burglary in the third degree and possession of burglar\u2019s tools. His claim that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting cross-examination of defendant concerning three prior burglaries is without merit (see, People v Mercado, 117 AD2d 627). We have reviewed defendant\u2019s remaining claim and find it to be without merit. (Appeal from judgment of Oneida County Court, Murad, J. \u2014 attempted burglary, third degree, and another charge.) Present \u2014 Callahan, J. P., Denman, Boomer, Balio and Lawton, JJ.\n",
