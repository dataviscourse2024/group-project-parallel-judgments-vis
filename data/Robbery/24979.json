Cota CA4/1\n                      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN OFFICIAL REPORTS\nCalifornia Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for\npublication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). This opinion has not been certified for publication\nor ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115.\n\n\n                    COURT OF APPEAL, FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n                                                  DIVISION ONE\n\n                                           STATE OF CALIFORNIA\n\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE,                                                         D069371\n\n         Plaintiff and Respondent,\n\n         v.                                                         (Super. Ct. No. SCS276743)\n\nFERNANDO COTA,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County, Stephanie\n\nSontag, Judge. Affirmed.\n\n\n\n         Patrick J. Hennessey, Jr., under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for\n\nDefendant and Appellant.\n\n         No appearance for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\n         A jury found Fernando Cota not guilty of burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459)1 but guilty\n\nof the lesser included offense of trespass (\u00a7 602.5). The jury found true the allegation\n\n\n\n1        All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\fthat a person authorized to be in the dwelling was present within the meaning of section\n\n602.5, subdivision (b). The jury also found Cota guilty of possessing a concealed dirk or\n\ndagger (\u00a7 21310). Cota admitted two prior prison convictions (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). The\n\ncourt initially sentenced Cota to the upper term of three years on the concealed dirk or\n\ndagger count and imposed two one-year terms for the admitted prison priors. However,\n\nat a later sentencing hearing on both the present case and trial court case No. SCS279566\n\n(the subject of the appeal in this court's case No. D069049), the court vacated the\n\nsentence in case No. SCS276743 and resentenced Cota to one-third the midterm on the\n\ndirk or dagger count or eight months, consecutive to the sentence imposed in case No.\n\nSCS279566. Cota was given credit for 322 days of time served and ordered to pay a $40\n\ncourt security fee, a $300 restitution fine, and a $300 parole revocation fine, stayed\n\npending successful completion of parole.\n\n                                           FACTS\n\n       The record does not include a reporter's transcript of the trial proceedings.\n\nAccording to the probation report, on January 1, 2015, at 2:06 a.m., police officers\n\nresponded to a burglary in progress at the home of Emilio Perez. Perez told the officers\n\nthat he awakened to find Cota standing inside his trailer. Cota stood motionless and\n\nPerez told his wife to call 911. Perez did not know Cota and did not give him permission\n\nto be inside the home. The officers arrested and searched Cota without incident. They\n\nrecovered a seven and one-half inch fixed blade knife from inside his waistband.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       Appellate counsel has filed a brief summarizing the facts and proceedings below\n\nbut raising no specific issues or argument for reversal. Counsel has asked this court to\n\nreview the record for error as mandated by People v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436.\n\nCounsel has not identified any possible issues under Anders v. California (1967) 386 U.S.\n\n738. We offered Cota the opportunity to file a brief on his own behalf, and he has not\n\nresponded.\n\n       Our review of the entire record under Wende and Anders has disclosed no\n\nreasonably arguable appellate issues. Appellate counsel has competently represented\n\nCota on appeal.\n\n                                     DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                                      McCONNELL, P.
