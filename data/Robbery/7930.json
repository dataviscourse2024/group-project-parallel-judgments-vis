Case No.\nCOSO13012404.\n\n   Nancy W. Gregoire Stamper of Birnbaum, Lippman & Gregoire, PLLC,\nFort Lauderdale, and Richard A. Ivers of the Law Office of Richard A. Ivers,\nCoconut Creek, for appellant.\n\n  Ronald R. Torres of the Torres Law Offices, Weston, for appellee\nNationwide Financial Services, LLC.\n\nKLINGENSMITH, C.J.\n\n   Appellant Hollywood Imports Limited, Inc., doing business as\nAutoNation Honda Hollywood, appeals the trial court\u2019s final judgment for\nconversion following a non-jury trial in favor of appellee Nationwide\nFinancial Services, LLC. We affirm the trial court\u2019s final judgment in all\nrespects except for its finding that appellee was entitled to the fair market\nvalue of the vehicle at the center of the dispute. On that issue, we reverse.\n\n   In 2012, a buyer entered a retail installment sale contract with a seller\nfor the purchase of a Volkswagen that provided for nine monthly\npayments. That contract was then assigned to Nationwide. The issued\ncertificate of title reflected the buyer was the registered owner and\nNationwide was the first lienholder. However, the buyer failed to make the\nlast payment due.\n\f   The buyer then signed another contract to purchase a vehicle from\nHollywood Imports and used the Volkswagen as a trade-in. Hollywood\nImports claims the buyer represented that no outstanding liens existed\nagainst the Volkswagen, he owned the vehicle free and clear, and he would\nclear up the discrepancy in the title report showing Nationwide\u2019s\noutstanding lien. Soon after, Hollywood Imports received a signed lien\nsatisfaction form reflecting Nationwide\u2019s lien had been satisfied.\nNationwide alleges the lien satisfaction document contained the forged\nsignature of Nationwide\u2019s authorized representative.\n\n   The buyer then signed an application for duplicate title for Hollywood\nImports, which was submitted along with the contested lien satisfaction\nform to the Department of Motor Vehicles (\u201cDMV\u201d). The DMV issued a\nduplicate certificate of title for the Volkswagen showing the buyer as the\nregistered owner and without naming Nationwide as the first lienholder.\nAfterwards, Hollywood Imports sold the vehicle to another customer.\n   Nationwide filed a complaint for conversion against Hollywood Imports\nin county court, claiming damages of $15,000.00. After a non-jury trial,\nthe county court entered final judgments that were later reversed on\nappeal by the circuit court sitting in its appellate capacity 1 and remanded\nback to the county court.\n\n    After the case went back to county court, Nationwide moved for entry\nof final judgment in its favor, arguing it was entitled to judgment for\n$15,000.00, plus prejudgment interest, because that was the maximum\nwhich the court could award and because it was the \u201cfair market value\u201d of\nthe vehicle.     Hollywood Imports moved for summary judgment on\ndamages, arguing Nationwide\u2019s recovery was limited to its interest in the\ncar, specifically the unpaid $2,018.45 installment which represented the\nbalance of its outstanding lien. The county court entered final judgment\nin favor of Nationwide, and relied on the Fifth District\u2019s opinion in Page v.\nMatthews, 386 So. 2d 815, 817 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980), to find that because\nHollywood Imports was not in privity of contract with Nationwide, and thus\nwas a \u201cstranger\u201d to the sales contract, Nationwide could recover the\nVolkswagen\u2019s full value. This appeal followed.\n\n    \u201cThe appropriate measure of damages, as compared with the amount\nof damages awarded, involves a legal question reviewable on appeal.\u201d R &\nB Holding Co., Inc. v. Christopher Advert. Grp., Inc., 994 So. 2d 329, 331\n\n1 The first appeal was prior to this court assuming jurisdiction of county court\nappeals. See Fla. R. App. P. 9.030(b); In re Amends. to Fla. Rule of App. Proc.\n9.030, 285 So. 3d 1246 (Fla. 2019).\n\n                                       2\n\f(Fla. 3d DCA 2008). As a result, our review of the trial court\u2019s damage\naward is de novo. See D\u2019Angelo v. Fitzmaurice, 863 So. 2d 311, 314 (Fla.\n2003) (\u201cThe standard of review for the pure question of law before us is de\nnovo.\u201d).\n\n    \u201cIn tort actions, the measure of damages [awarded] seeks to restore the\nvictim to the position he would be in had the wrong not been committed.\u201d\nAshland Oil, Inc. v. Pickard, 269 So. 2d 714, 723 (Fla. 3d DCA 1972).\nOrdinarily, the damages which an owner in a conversion action can recover\nis \u201cthe fair market value of the property at the time of the conversion plus\nlegal interest to the date of the verdict.\u201d Cutler v. Pelletier, 507 So. 2d 676,\n679 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987).\n\n   Here, Nationwide was not the Volkswagen\u2019s owner, and only had an\ninterest in the car as a lienholder. It is well settled that \u201cone who has a\nspecial interest in personal property can only recover in a conversion\naction the value of his interest in the property.\u201d Mercury Motor Exp., Inc.\nv. Crockett, 422 So. 2d 358, 359 (Fla. 1st DCA 1982) (quoting Page, 386\nSo. 2d at 816); see also Fletcher v. Dees, 134 So. 234, 235 (Fla. 1931)\n(holding that \u201cone who has a special interest can only recover the value of\nhis special interest in the property\u201d); Stearns v. Landmark First Nat\u2019l Bank\nof Fort Lauderdale, 498 So. 2d 1001, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA 1986) (plaintiff\nin a conversion action against bank could pursue the claim only to the\nextent of her one-half interest in the property).\n\n    The \u201cstranger\u201d rule used by the lower court should not be applied to\nimproperly award Nationwide the Volkswagen\u2019s fair market value and, in\neffect, give them a windfall. The rationale of the \u201cstranger\u201d rule allows\nspecial interest holders to recover the full value of the property but only in\ncases where the holder of such limited or qualified interest is also liable to\na person owning a superior or remainder interest. See, e.g., First Tenn.\nBank, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Graphic Arts Ctr., Inc., 859 S.W.2d 858, 867 (Mo. Ct.\nApp. 1993). The general owner of the Volkswagen in this case was the\nbuyer, while Nationwide only had a security interest by way of a lien.\n\n   In other words, lienholders may recover the fair market value amount\nfrom wrongdoers in a conversion action only when the special interest\nowner is answerable to the general owner for whatever interest remains\nafter the special claim is satisfied. See id. The reason for allowing such\nrecovery in those limited cases is because the party having the limited or\nqualified interest is liable themselves to the owner of the remaining\ninterest. Thus, to be adequately compensated, the special interest holder\nmust receive sufficient compensation not only to compensate for the\n\n\n                                       3\n\fholder\u2019s loss but also to satisfy the demands of such other owners who\npossess a superior interest.\n\n  Nothing in the evidence presented to the lower court suggested that\nNationwide was responsible to another party holding any superior interest.\nNationwide\u2019s only interest remaining in the subject vehicle was the one\nunpaid monthly installment.         Therefore, the rationale behind the\napplication of the \u201cstranger\u201d rule does not apply here.\n\n     While Florida has no statute covering the act of conversion, by analogy\nthe replevin statute, section 78.19, Florida Statutes (2013), is instructive.\nThat statute provides: \u201c[W]hen plaintiff\u2019s interest in the property is based\non a claim of lien or some special interest therein, the judgment shall be\nonly for the amount of the lien or the value of such special interest and costs\n. . . .\u201d \u00a7 78.19(1), Fla. Stat. (2013) (emphasis added). See Littman v. Com.\nBank & Tr. Co., 425 So. 2d 636, 641 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983) (emphasis added)\n(requiring appellants to pay the remaining balance under the security\nagreement as damages, after both parties had purchased and resold the\nequipment subject to the bank\u2019s lien, \u201cindicating at least some knowledge\nand acceptance of the lien as the property\u2019s true value\u201d).\n\n    We decline to permit parties in conversion cases to exceed\ncompensatory limits to impose a penalty upon a defendant, thus allowing\na conversion action to take the place of other remedies such as civil theft,\nwhich allows an injured party to recover an amount exceeding those limits.\n\u201c[T]he purpose of compensatory tort damages is to compensate\u201d; it is not\nthe purpose of such damages \u201cto punish defendants or bestow a windfall\nupon plaintiffs.\u201d MCI Worldcom Network Servs., Inc. v. Mastec, Inc., 995\nSo. 2d 221, 224 (Fla. 2008) (quoting Coop. Leasing, Inc. v. Johnson, 872\nSo. 2d 956, 958 (Fla. 2d DCA 2004)). As the Florida Supreme Court\nexplained:\n\n      The fundamental principle of the law of damages is that the\n      person injured by breach of contract or by wrongful or\n      negligent act or omission shall have fair and just\n      compensation commensurate with the loss sustained in\n      consequence of the defendants act which give[s] rise to the\n      action. In other words, the damages awarded should be equal\n      to and precisely commensurate with the injury sustained.\n\nMCI Worldcom, 995 So. 2d at 224 (quoting Hanna v. Martin, 49 So. 2d 585,\n587 (Fla. 1950)). \u201cThe view that a windfall, if any is to be enjoyed, should\ngo to the plaintiff borders too closely on approval of unwarranted punitive\n\n\n                                      4\n\fdamages, and it is a view not espoused by our cases.\u201d Fla. Physician\u2019s Ins.\nReciprocal v. Stanley, 452 So. 2d 514, 516 (Fla. 1984) (citation omitted).\n\n    Accordingly, we reverse the award of the vehicle\u2019s fair market value to\nNationwide and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We\naffirm on all other issues without comment.\n\n   Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\nGERBER and ARTAU, JJ., concur.\n\n                           *         *        *\n\n   Not final until disposition of timely filed motion for rehearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\f",
