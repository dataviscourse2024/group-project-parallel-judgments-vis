CROOK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      The State\u2019s evidence tended to show the following: On 14 June 2013, Detective\n\nDaniel Barale with the Fletcher Police Department was patrolling the hotels and\n\nmotels of the area. He parked at the Knights Inn Motel and was sitting in his vehicle\n\nwhen he saw a black Jeep pull in and park behind him. Detective Barale entered the\n\nlicense plate number into a program on his computer, which indicated that the license\n\nplate had been revoked and belonged to a Crown Victoria.\n\n      Detective Barale then searched for the registered owner of the Crown Victoria\n\nvia the computer program and learned that Nicholas Taylor, who had an active\n\nwarrant out of Buncombe County, owned the car. Detective Barale testified that\n\naround the same time, \u201ctwo younger white males came out [of the Jeep] and walked\n\nright in front of me.\u201d The computer program displayed a picture of Taylor with a neck\n\ntattoo, which allowed Detective Barale to identify one of the men who walked in front\n\nof his car as Taylor. Detective Barale also testified that one of the men had a large,\n\nfixed-blade knife on his belt. The men walked up the stairs on the outside of the\n\nmotel and entered a motel room.\n\n      After Detective Barale confirmed with dispatch that the Buncombe County\n\nwarrant for Taylor was still active, he called for backup. A few minutes later, Officer\n\nBrian Fulmer arrived, and they knocked on the motel room door where Taylor and\n\nthe other male had entered. Detective Barale knocked \u201ca couple times,\u201d and\n\nannounced, \u201cFletcher Police,\u201d but no one answered. Detective Barale testified that\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                   STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nhe could see through the blinds and observed Taylor and the other male sitting on\n\nthe beds as well as a third person coming from the back of the room where the\n\nbathroom was located. Around that same time, Detective Barale retrieved a passkey\n\nfrom a maintenance worker to unlock the door, however, the chain on the inside was\n\nlatched. Defendant opened the door, walked outside, and tried to shut the door\n\nbehind him. Detective Barale told him \u201cto get out of the way\u201d and that \u201cwe had a\n\nwarrant for arrest for one of the persons inside.\u201d Detective Barale testified that\n\ndefendant \u201ctried to turn around and go back inside. I grabbed him. And we started\n\nwrestling. I took him to the ground and handcuffed him.\u201d Detective Barale stated\n\nthat he placed defendant under arrest for resisting his investigation.\n\n      Detective Barale testified as follows:\n\n             Q. Once you got handcuffs on him what did you do at that\n             point?\n\n             A. I first did a quick pat down of him. First off, I asked him\n             to sit down and I checked on the other officer, because I\n             knew he had two to deal with. Once I did that, I went back\n             to [defendant] and I asked\u2014I patted him down. I found\n             scales in his pocket. I retrieved the scales. And I asked\n             him did he have anything else on him.\n\n             ...\n\n             Q. And what was his response?\n\n             MR. JOHNSON: Objection.\n\n             THE COURT: Overruled.\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                                       STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n              MR. JOHNSON: I would just like to renew it on\u2014based on\n              the pretrial motion and due process.\n\n              THE COURT: Objection noted.\n\n              Q. Well, let me ask. What did you ask the defendant again?\n\n              A. I asked him if he had anything else on him.\n\n              Q. And what was his response?\n\n              A. \u201cI have weed in the room.\u201d\n\n              Q. And what did you do at that point?\n\n              A. At that point once we made sure that the other two were\n              not going to be an issue, I helped [defendant] to his feet,\n              and we went into the room. There is a\u2014there was a small\n              table right next to the room and two chairs, and I sat him\n              down right there on those chairs. I then went into the back\n              area of the room where the bathroom is located to make\n              sure there was nobody else and do a quick check and make\n              sure there are no weapons anywhere within reach of\n              [defendant]. When I entered the bathroom, the toilet seat\n              was up, and there was leaves, green leaves, floating in the\n              toilet bowl and a syringe. And there was another syringe\u2014\n              well, appeared to be another syringe at the bottom that\n              sunk.\n\n              Q. What did you do once you saw that?\n\n              A. At that point I left it where it was. I went back and\n              asked [defendant] to tell me\u2014point to me where the weed\n              was. He went in between the two beds to a nightstand, and\n              there was a small jewelry box.1 He opened the jewelry box\n              and grabbed a plastic bag, like a Ziploc bag, and there\n              were\u2014that contained marijuana. He then tried to close the\n              jewelry box very quickly. But before he did, I could see that\n\n1On cross-examination, Detective Barale noted that \u201che was handcuffed behind his back. . . . [He]\nwas backing up to . . . [the] jewelry box . . . so he could use his hands.\u201d\n\n                                              -4-\n\f                                           STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n                  there was more in the jewelry box, including at least one\n                  glass pipe that I could see and a small baggy that had\u2014\n                  little small clear plastic bag that had some kind of white or\n                  light tan powder.2\n\n                  Q. What did you do once he tried to close that box?\n\n                  A. I sat him back down on the chair and seized the box.\n\n                  Q. What\u2014once you seized the box what did you do?\n\n                  A. Looked in the box. And I believe there were actually two\n                  glass pipes in the box and two bags of marijuana, some,\n                  what we call, blunts which is an empty cigar that are used\n                  to smoke marijuana, stuff them with marijuana and smoke\n                  them. And I believe there was also one marijuana cigarette\n                  that was all ready to be smoked.\n\n                  Q. What did you do once you found those items in the\n                  jewelry box? Let me back you up. Who took you to that\n                  jewelry box?\n\n                  A. [Defendant] did.\n\n                  Q. And what did you do once you found those items in the\n                  jewelry box?\n\n                  A. I seized the jewelry box.\n\n                  Q. And what did you do at that point?\n\n                  A. At that point I believe I asked [defendant] what else in\n                  the room was his. I think he pointed to a backpack. And I\n                  went back to the bathroom to retrieve the evidence that\n                  was in the toilet bowl.\n\n                  Q. And this was the, I believe you said, green leafy\n                  substance and the syringe?\n\n\n2   The powder was later identified as heroin.\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f                                 STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                 Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n\n            A. Correct.\n\n            Q. What did you do once you went in there to retrieve that?\n\n            A. I got in there and I was looking for something that I\n            could use to reach in the toilet bowl. Some hotels have\n            those clear trash bag liners, I was looking for one of those\n            I could put my hand in that and try to pick up stuff from\n            the toilet bowl. So I looked up, and there was a towel rack\n            that\u2019s facing right above the toilet. And on that I saw a\n            wrapped toilet paper roll, and it was on its side about 45\n            degrees pointing to the wall. The end of it was wet. The\n            wrapper around the toilet paper was wet. And I looked\n            around and I saw that there was a clear plastic bag\n            pointing\u2014sticking out of it. And I looked at a little bit\n            closer and I also saw it was [sic] light or white tan powder\n            in that plastic bag.\n\n            Q. And what did you do once you found that powder?\n\n            A. I retrieved it.\n\n            Q. What did you do at that point?\n\n            A. At that point I came back to [defendant] and I read\n            [defendant] his Miranda rights.\n\n            Q. And what happened at that point?\n\n            A. I asked [defendant], you know, who the powder belonged\n            to, if he knew anything about it. He denied. I asked him if\n            he had bought it or sold it\u2014I believe the way I put it: Did\n            you buy or sell anything to Mr. Dawkins and Mr. Taylor,\n            the other two? And he said no.\n\n      Detective Barale also found a wallet on the table where defendant was seated,\n\nwhich defendant admitted was his. The wallet contained two North Carolina driver\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                                          STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nlicenses: one in the name of Christopher Messer, and another in the name of Kyle\n\nAndre. When asked who they belonged to, defendant stated \u201cit was his friends.\u201d\n\nDetective Barale also testified that defendant stated the Christopher Messer license\n\nwas his own.\n\n          Detective Barale placed defendant, who was handcuffed with his hands behind\n\nhis back, in Officer Fulmer\u2019s patrol vehicle. Detective Barale testified that he saw\n\ndefendant looking toward him, so he opened the car door and saw a small, folded piece\n\nof paper on the floorboard that contained a \u201cvery small amount of clear crystal.\u201d3\n\nWhen Detective Barale asked defendant what it was, defendant \u201cdenied knowing\n\nanything about it and told me that I had planted it in the vehicle.\u201d Officer Fulmer\n\nthen transported defendant to the Henderson County jail for processing. Detective\n\nBarale presented the evidence from that day to a magistrate, who issued an order in\n\nthe name of Christopher Messer. Additionally, defendant applied for and obtained\n\nan appearance bond in the name of Christopher Messer. Days later, on 17 June 2013,\n\nOfficer Fulmer informed Detective Barale that the person he booked on 14 June 2013\n\nwas not Christopher Messer but was actually Christopher Crook.\n\n          Defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that when Officer Fulmer asked\n\ndefendant what his name was, he stated, \u201cChristopher Crook.\u201d          Officer Fulmer\n\ntestified that he called the name, \u201cChristopher Crook,\u201d into dispatch, and that\n\n\n\n3   The crystal was later identified as methamphetamine.\n\n                                                -7-\n\f                                   STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\ndefendant never told him that his name was Christopher Messer.\n\n      On 30 September 2013, defendant was indicted for the following charges:\n\npossession of methamphetamine, trafficking in heroin, two counts of identity theft,\n\nresisting a public officer, possession of a schedule IV controlled substance, possession\n\nof up to one half ounce of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. On 18\n\nFebruary 2014, defendant filed a motion to suppress statements defendant made\n\nwhile in custody and prior to receiving Miranda warnings.\n\n      The matter came on for trial at the 10 March 2014 Criminal Session of\n\nHenderson County Superior Court. After a voir dire examination of Detective Barale,\n\nthe trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The jury found defendant not\n\nguilty of possession of methamphetamine and not guilty of trafficking in heroin.\n\nDefendant pleaded guilty to possession of a schedule IV controlled substance, and the\n\njury found defendant guilty of the remaining charges. On 14 March 2014, the trial\n\ncourt sentenced defendant to a term of thirteen to twenty-five months for one count\n\nof identity theft and to a consecutive term of thirteen to twenty-five months for the\n\nremaining convictions. Defendant filed a petition for writ of certiorari on 22 January\n\n2015, which we allowed.\n\n                                     II. Analysis\n\nA. Motion to Suppress\n\n      Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f                                   STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nhis statement, \u201cI have weed in the room.\u201d Defendant states, \u201cTo the extent the trial\n\ncourt concluded that [defendant] was not in custody when Detective Barale\n\nquestioned him, the trial court\u2019s conclusion was unsupported by the findings and the\n\nevidence.\u201d Moreover, the statement was made in response to Detective Barale\u2019s direct\n\nquestioning.\n\n      \u201cThe standard of review when appealing from a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion\n\nto suppress is that \u2018the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive on appeal if\n\nsupported by competent evidence, even if the evidence is conflicting. The trial court\u2019s\n\nconclusions of law, however, are fully reviewable.\u2019 \u201d State v. Evans, 201 N.C. App.\n\n572, 574, 688 S.E.2d 25, 26\u201327 (2009) (quoting State v. Green, 194 N.C. App. 623, 626,\n\n670 S.E.2d 635, 637 (2009)).\n\n      Here, the trial court found that the \u201cofficer was searching the defendant for his\n\nown safety and was not conducting an in-custody interrogation at that time.\u201d It\n\nconcluded that the \u201cofficer was reasonable based on the particular circumstances of\n\nplacing the defendant under arrest to inquire as to whether or not the defendant had\n\nany other objects on him. And the response of the defendant was voluntarily made,\n\nthat the marijuana or weed, end quote, was the marijuana of the defendant.\u201d The\n\ntrial court concluded that \u201cthis question asked by the officer prior to the Miranda\n\nrights being given to the defendant was not a custodial interrogation.\u201d\n\n      In Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court held, \u201c[T]he prosecution may not\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f                                    STATE V.

Ed. 2d 694, 706 (1966). The Court explained, \u201cBy custodial interrogation,\n\nwe mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been\n\ntaken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant\n\nway.\u201d Id. The North Carolina Supreme Court has likewise confirmed that \u201cthe rule\n\nof Miranda applies only where a defendant is subjected to custodial interrogation.\u201d\n\nState v. Gaines, 345 N.C. 647, 661, 483 S.E.2d 396, 404 (1997) (citation omitted).\n\n      We have previously stated that \u201cthe determination of whether a defendant was\n\nin custody is a question of law, [and] it is fully reviewable here.\u201d State v.

In\n\ndetermining if a suspect is in custody, \u201cthe definitive inquiry is whether there was a\n\nformal arrest or a restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a\n\nformal arrest.\u201d Gaines, 345 N.C. at 662, 483 S.E.2d at 405 (citing Stansbury v.\n\nCalifornia, 511 U.S. 318, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1994)).\n\n      Here, as found by the trial court, immediately following the scuffle with\n\nDetective Barale, defendant was handcuffed behind his back and placed under arrest\n\nfor resisting a public officer. Accordingly, because defendant was under formal arrest,\n\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\f                                   STATE V.

The trial court erred\n\ninasmuch as it concluded defendant was not in custody.\n\n      \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s determination of whether an interrogation is conducted\n\nwhile a person is in custody involves reaching a conclusion of law, which is fully\n\nreviewable on appeal.\u201d State v. Buchanan, 353 N.C. 332, 336, 543 S.E.2d 823, 826\n\n(2001) (citing State v. Greene, 332 N.C. 565, 577, 422 S.E.2d 730, 737 (1992)). In\n\nRhode Island v. Innis, the Supreme Court discussed the meaning of interrogation and\n\nconcluded that \u201cthe Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody\n\nis subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d 446 U.S. 291,\n\n300\u201301, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 307\u201308 (1980). In this case, because Detective Barale asked\n\ndefendant an express question, we need not determine whether Detective Barale\u2019s\n\nconduct amounted to the \u201cfunctional equivalent.\u201d See id. at 301, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 308\n\n(noting that the functional equivalent includes \u201cany words or actions on the part of\n\nthe police . . . that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an\n\nincriminating response from the suspect\u201d); Fisher, 158 N.C. App. at 142, 580 S.E.2d\n\nat 413.\n\n      Here, after Detective Barale handcuffed defendant, placed him under arrest,\n\nand conducted a pat-down which led to the recovery of a digital scale, he expressly\n\nasked defendant, \u201cDo you have anything else on you?\u201d Defendant, in custody in front\n\nof the doorway to the motel room, stated, \u201cI have weed in the room.\u201d Accordingly,\n\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f                                   STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nbecause defendant was subjected to express questioning while he was in custody,\n\nunder Miranda, he was entitled to procedural safeguards informing him of, inter alia,\n\nhis right to remain silent. As defendant did not receive Miranda warnings, the\n\nprosecution was not permitted to use defendant\u2019s statement stemming from the\n\ncustodial interrogation. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, 16 L. Ed. 2d at 706. Therefore,\n\nthe trial court erred in concluding that defendant was not subject to custodial\n\ninterrogation and in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement.\n\n      We disagree with the State\u2019s argument that the public safety exception\n\nestablished in New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1984), applies.\n\nIn that case, a woman approached two officers\u2019 patrol vehicle and informed them that\n\nshe had just been raped, and that the man, whom she described to the officers, had\n\njust entered an A&P supermarket located nearby and was carrying a gun. Id. at 651\u2013\n\n52, 81 L. Ed. 2d at 554. The officers drove to the supermarket, spotted a man who\n\nmatched the description, and pursued him as he ran toward the rear of the store. Id.\n\nat 652, 81 L. Ed. 2d at 554. As one of the officers placed the man in custody, he\n\nnoticed the man was wearing an empty shoulder holster, so he asked him where the\n\ngun was. Id. In holding that the state court erred in excluding the suspect\u2019s response\n\nto the question, the Supreme Court recognized \u201ca narrow exception to the Miranda\n\nrule\u201d when it concluded that \u201cthere is a \u2018public safety\u2019 exception to the requirement\n\nthat Miranda warnings be given before a suspect\u2019s answers may be admitted into\n\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\f                                    STATE V.

Ed. 2d at 558, 557.\n\n      The facts of this case are noticeably distinguishable from those in Quarles.\n\nHere, \u201cthe need for answers to questions\u201d did not pose a threat to the public safety,\n\noutweighing the need for a rule protecting defendant\u2019s privilege against self-\n\nincrimination. Id. at 657, 81 L. Ed. 2d at 558. Defendant was not suspected of\n\ncarrying a gun or other weapon. Rather, he was sitting on the ground in handcuffs\n\nand he had already been \u201cpatted down,\u201d which produced only a digital scale.\n\nMoreover, in Quarles, immediately after securing the loaded revolver, the officer\n\nadvised the suspect of his rights before continuing with \u201cinvestigatory questions\n\nabout the ownership[.]\u201d Id. at 659, 81 L. Ed. 2d at 559. In contrast, here, the officers\n\nconducted a full search of the motel room and posed further investigatory questions\n\nto defendant, including asking him to reveal everything he owned in the motel room,\n\nbefore ultimately reading him his rights. Accordingly, we reject the State\u2019s argument\n\nthat the public safety exception should apply in this case. See State v. Crudup, 157\n\nN.C. App. 657, 661, 580 S.E.2d 21, 25 (2003) (holding that the \u201ccircumstances in this\n\ncase exceed the narrow scope of the public safety exception [as] [d]efendant was\n\nhandcuffed[,] . . . surrounded by three officers[,] and [t]here was no risk of imminent\n\ndanger to the public, the officers, or even to the defendant\u201d).\n\n      For the following reasons, defendant has established he was prejudiced by the\n\ntrial court\u2019s error in refusing to exclude his statement. \u201cA defendant is prejudiced by\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                          STATE V.

Nonetheless, we\n\nheld that there was \u201cno reasonable possibility that the exclusion of defendant\u2019s\n\nstatement would have resulted in a different verdict.\u201d Id. at 124, 575 S.E.2d at 822.\n\nJudge Hunter, dissenting in part, maintained that \u201cthe admission of defendant\u2019s\n\nstatement to [the officer] that he had some crack in his coat pocket was highly\n\ninflammatory on the issue of whether defendant knowingly possessed the cocaine\u201d\n\nand the State\u2019s evidence, excluding the defendant\u2019s statement, was \u201chardly\n\noverwhelming.\u201d Id. at 127, 575 S.E.2d at 824 (Hunter, J., dissenting in part). He\n\nwrote, \u201cIn fact, the only evidence against defendant is that cocaine, discovered as a\n\nresult of a Miranda violation, was found inside the coat defendant was wearing.\n\n\n\n4 See United States v.

Our Supreme Court reversed for the reasons stated in\n\nJudge Hunter\u2019s dissenting opinion. 358 N.C. 142, 592 S.E.2d 687 (2004).\n\n      Here, like in Phelps, the State did not present \u201coverwhelming evidence,\u201d\n\nexcluding defendant\u2019s statement, which linked him to the marijuana and\n\ncorresponding drug paraphernalia found in the same location. Defendant was\n\nacquitted of the charges for other drugs to which he did not admit ownership, two\n\nother people were in the motel room when officers arrived, and a fourth individual\n\nrented the motel room.

The trial\n\ncourt agreed, concluding, \u201c[T]he prior record level worksheet that the State had\n\nprovided to Defendant in discovery did not constitute written notice of the State\u2019s\n\nintent to prove that Defendant had committed the offense for which he was being\n\nsentenced while on probation.\u201d Id. This Court affirmed, stating, \u201cAt most, this prior\n\nrecord worksheet constituted a possible calculation of Defendant\u2019s prior record level\n\nand did not provide affirmative notice that the State intended to prove the existence\n\nof the prior record point authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.14(b)(7) as required\n\nby N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.16(a6).\u201d Id. at *7. We noted that the State \u201chad the\n\nability to comply with the statute using regular forms promulgated for this specific\n\npurpose by the Administrative Office of the Courts.\u201d Id. (quoting State v. Mackey,\n\n209 N.C. App. 116, 121, 708 S.E.2d 719, 722 (2011)).\n\n\n\n                                          - 20 -\n\f                                        STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       In State v. Snelling, we held that the trial court erred in sentencing the\n\ndefendant as a prior record level III because it failed to comply with N.C. Gen. Stat.\n\n\u00a7 15A-1340.16(a6). 231 N.C. App. at 682, 752 S.E.2d at 744. Because the trial court\n\ndid not determine if the statutory requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.16(a6)\n\nwere met, no evidence showed that the State provided notice of its intent to prove\n\nthat probation point, and no evidence indicated that defendant waived his right to\n\nreceive such notice, we found prejudicial error and remanded for resentencing. Id. at\n\n682\u201383, 752 S.E.2d at 744. As defendant points out, the defendant in Snelling also\n\nstipulated to his prior record level points, including one point for an offense\n\ncommitted while he was on probation. Id. at 678, 752 S.E.2d at 742.\n\n       Here, like in Snelling, the trial court did not determine that the State had\n\nprovided notice of its intent to prove defendant committed the crimes charged while\n\non probation, parole, or post-release supervision. Additionally, like in Williams,\n\nassuming that the State had included defendant\u2019s prior record level worksheet in\n\ndiscovery, such action does not constitute \u201cwritten notice of its intent to prove the\n\nexistence of . . . a prior record level point under G.S. 15A-1340.14(b)(7).\u201d N.C. Gen.\n\nStat. \u00a7 15A-1340.16(a6). Moreover, no evidence shows defendant waived such notice.\n\n       Acknowledging that Williams is not controlling legal authority as it is an\n\nunpublished case,5 we decline the State\u2019s invitation to reach a different conclusion\n\n\n5See N.C. R. App. P. 30(e)(3) (\u201cAn unpublished decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals does\nnot constitute controlling legal authority.\u201d).\n\n                                              - 21 -\n\f                                       STATE V. CROOK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nhere.   Moreover, we do not find merit in the State\u2019s distinction that unlike in\n\nWilliams, the prior record level calculation here was \u201ctypewritten on the prior record\n\nlevel worksheet, rather than handwritten, which indicates permanency.\u201d The trial\n\ncourt erred by including the probation point in sentencing defendant as a prior record\n\nlevel II offender. This error was prejudicial because the additional point raised\n\ndefendant\u2019s prior record level from I to II.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n        The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement,\n\n\u201cI have weed in the room.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial on the\n\npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia charges. The trial court did not\n\ncommit plain error in its jury instructions on identity theft. The trial court committed\n\nprejudicial error by including the probation point in sentencing defendant as a prior\n\nrecord level II offender. Therefore, we vacate defendant\u2019s sentence, and we remand\n\nto the trial court for resentencing.\n\n        REVERSED IN PART; NO ERROR IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED.\n\n        Judges McCULLOUGH and INMAN concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 22 -\n\f",
