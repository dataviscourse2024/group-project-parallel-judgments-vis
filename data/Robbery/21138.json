He\n\nelected to have the jury assess his punishment and was sentenced to fourteen years\u2019\n\nimprisonment.    In his sole issue, Peters contends that the trial court erred by not\n\nallowing him to testify at punishment as to the sexual nature of his relationship with the\n\nvictim. We will affirm.\n\n      On the evening of January 18, 2007, the victim responded to a knock at his front\n\ndoor. As he began to open the door, two men dressed in black and wearing masks and\n\fgloves rushed into his home. The victim recognized one of the intruders as Peters, who\n\noccasionally worked at his home and at his pet-grooming business. The victim did not\n\nrecognize the other intruder, who was later identified as Michael Bean. Bean pushed\n\nthe victim against the wall, put a gun up to his head, and demanded money. When the\n\nvictim replied that he did not have any money, Bean hit him in the head with the butt of\n\nthe gun. The men then pushed the victim into the kitchen. Soon thereafter, Bean forced\n\nthe victim into the bedroom. The victim saw that Peters had located a safe that the\n\nvictim kept hidden in his bedroom closet. Peters and Bean had the victim get the key\n\nand open the safe. The safe contained about $4,000. As Peters and Bean then tried to\n\nfigure out if they could steal any other items, Bean hit the victim in the head about\n\nseven times. Peters and Bean then put the victim on the floor in the utility room, and\n\nPeters bound the victim with duct tape. Peters also ripped out the telephones from the\n\nwall. In all, Peters and Bean took about $4,000 from the safe, an antique butter churn\n\nfull of coins, and the victim\u2019s cell phone.\n\n        Prior to trial, the State filed a motion in limine asking the trial court in part to\n\norder Peters, his counsel, and defense witnesses not to allude to, refer to, or in any way\n\nbring before the jury any matter regarding \u201cevidence of character or conduct of any\n\nState\u2019s witness\u201d and \u201c[t]he personal habits of the State\u2019s witnesses such as drinking, use\n\nof drugs or sexual activity, not shown to the Court to be material to this cause\u201d without\n\nfirst approaching the bench and advising the court. The trial court granted the motion\n\nin limine.\n\n\n\n\nPeters v. State                                                                       Page 2\n\f        During the punishment phase, Peters testified that he is a Hurricane Katrina\n\nevacuee who arrived in Cleburne, Texas, in 2006 when he was seventeen years old.\n\nPeters was looking for a job, so a friend introduced him to the victim. Peters worked for\n\nthe victim for approximately seven or eight months. Peters stated that the victim would\n\npay him daily or weekly, depending on what type of job it was. Peters earned $15 to\n\n$20 or $60 to $70, depending on what type of job it was. When asked what type of\n\nthings he would have to do for the victim in order to get paid, he replied, \u201cWell, he\n\nwould have me mow -- mow his lawn, shovel the dog droppings, clean the kitty litter\n\nboxes, and have sex with him.\u201d At that time, the State asserted that the answer was a\n\nviolation of the motion in limine.\n\n        At defense counsel\u2019s request, a hearing on the admissibility of the testimony was\n\nheld outside the presence of the jury. During the hearing, Peters testified that the\n\nvictim, aware of Peters\u2019 need for more money, offered to pay Peters to have sex with\n\nhim. Peters was seventeen years old at the time, and he thinks the victim was forty or\n\nfifty. Peters agreed to the offer from the victim on a business basis only, and he and the\n\nvictim would have sex two or three times a week for which Peters would receive $60 to\n\n$100 per encounter. The trial court sustained the State\u2019s objections, including relevancy\n\nand Rule 403, and excluded the evidence.\n\n         We review a trial court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Torres v. State, 71 S.W.3d 758, 760 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). Under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard, we will uphold the decision of the trial court concerning the\n\n\n\n\nPeters v. State                                                                     Page 3\n\fadmissibility of evidence unless the ruling rests outside the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. Martin v. State, 173 S.W.3d 463, 467 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n\n        Section 3(a) of article 37.07 of the Code of Criminal Procedure governs the\n\nadmissibility of evidence at punishment:\n\n        Regardless of the plea and whether the punishment be assessed by the\n        judge or the jury, evidence may be offered by the state and the defendant\n        as to any matter the court deems relevant to sentencing, including but not\n        limited to the prior criminal record of the defendant, his general\n        reputation, his character, an opinion regarding his character, the\n        circumstances of the offense for which he is being tried, and,\n        notwithstanding Rules 404 and 405, Texas Rules of Evidence, any other\n        evidence of an extraneous crime or bad act that is shown beyond a\n        reasonable doubt by evidence to have been committed by the defendant or\n        for which he could be held criminally responsible, regardless of whether\n        he has previously been charged with or finally convicted of the crime or\n        act.\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 37.07, \u00a7 3(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2010). Relevancy in the\n\npunishment phase is \u201ca question of what is helpful to the jury in determining the\n\nappropriate sentence for a particular defendant in a particular case.\u201d Rogers v. State, 991\n\nS.W.2d 263, 265 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). In punishment, then, admissibility of evidence\n\nis more a matter of policy than of \u201clogical relevance.\u201d Id. We will assume that Peters\u2019\n\ntestimony was relevant in the punishment phase.\n\n        But under Rule 403, otherwise relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its\n\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\n\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or\n\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d TEX. R. EVID. 403.\n\n             In its seminal decision in Montgomery v. State, the Court of Criminal\n        Appeals identified four non-exclusive factors to be considered in\n\nPeters v. State                                                                      Page 4\n\f        determining whether evidence should be excluded under Rule 403. 810\n        S.W.2d 372, 389-90 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (op. on reh\u2019g). Those factors\n        were: (1) the probative value of the evidence; (2) the potential to impress\n        the jury in some irrational, yet indelible way; (3) the time needed to\n        develop the evidence; and, (4) the proponent\u2019s need for the evidence. See\n        id. (citing 22 CHARLES A. WRIGHT & KENNETH W. GRAHAM, FEDERAL\n        PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 5250, at 545-51 (1978); EDWARD J.\n        IMWINKELRIED, UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT EVIDENCE \u00a7\u00a7 2:12, 8:03, 8:07\n        (1984)); accord Prible v. State, 175 S.W.3d 724, 733 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n\n              More recently, the Court has looked to the language of Rule 403\n        and restated the pertinent factors.\n\n             [A] trial court, when undertaking a Rule 403 analysis, must balance\n             (1) the inherent probative force of the proffered evidence along\n             with (2) the proponent\u2019s need for that evidence against (3) any\n             tendency of the evidence to suggest decision on an improper basis,\n             (4) any tendency of the evidence to confuse or distract the jury from\n             the main issues, (5) any tendency of the evidence to be given undue\n             weight by a jury that has not been equipped to evaluate the\n             probative force of the evidence, and (6) the likelihood that\n             presentation of the evidence will consume an inordinate amount of\n             time or merely repeat evidence already admitted. Of course, these\n             factors may well blend together in practice.\n\n        Gigliobianco v. State, 210 S.W.3d 637, 641-42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)\n        (footnotes omitted); accord Subirias v. State, 278 S.W.3d 406, 408 (Tex.\n        App.\u2014San Antonio 2008, pet. ref\u2019d); Brock v. State, 275 S.W.3d 586, 590\n        (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo 2008, pet. ref\u2019d); Stafford v. State, 248 S.W.3d 400,\n        411-12 (Tex. App.\u2014Beaumont 2008, pet. ref\u2019d); but see De La Paz [v. State],\n        279 S.W.3d [336, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)] (applying Montgomery\n        factors).\n\nNewton v. State, 301 S.W.3d 315, 319 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2009, pet. ref\u2019d) (footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n        Peters contends that his testimony that the victim, \u201can older man,\u201d was paying\n\nhim, \u201ca 17 year old boy,\u201d for sexual activity, combined with the testimony of his family\n\nand severe financial troubles, was necessary to show that the victim had Peters \u201cbacked\n\n\nPeters v. State                                                                        Page 5\n\finto a corner where the only options Mr. Peters saw were prostitution or stealing.\u201d\n\nPeters states in his brief, \u201cThis type of argument would be something that a jury would\n\nmost certainly take into account when determining why, the then seventeen year old,\n\nMr. Peters, would rob someone who had given him a job, and it might have shortened\n\nMr. Peter\u2019s [sic] jail term.\u201d\n\n        But nothing in the record suggests a connection between the alleged sexual\n\narrangement between Peters and the victim and the aggravated robbery. As the State\n\npoints out in its brief, there was no mention that the victim failed to pay for one of the\n\nsexual encounters or that Peters was shortchanged in any way for sexual services\n\nrendered. Furthermore, the testimony would tend to suggest a decision on an improper\n\nbasis and tend to confuse or distract the jury from the main issues. And while the\n\npresentation of this evidence would not consume an inordinate amount of time, it\n\nwould be partially repetitious of evidence already admitted.           Peters had already\n\ntestified at the punishment phase that the victim paid him for sex.\n\n        For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Peters\u2019\n\ntestimony at punishment as to the sexual nature of his relationship with the victim. We\n\noverrule Peters\u2019 sole issue and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                  REX D.
