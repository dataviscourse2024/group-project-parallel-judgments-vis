He argues his conviction must be reversed because the trial\ncourt erred when it sustained an objection to a closing argument of defense counsel about\nthe prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. We find any error related to defendant\u2019s trial\nharmless. However, after inviting supplemental briefing regarding defendant\u2019s\nentitlement to consideration for mental health diversion under Penal Code\nsection 1001.36, we will conditionally reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the\ntrial court with directions to conduct a diversion eligibility hearing.\n         Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus\nalleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and a supplemental petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus seeking remand for a mental health diversion eligibility hearing. We\ndispose of those petitions by separate order filed this day. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule\n8.387(b)(2)(B).)\n\f                          I.    TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS\n        Defendant was charged with a single count of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211).\nAccording to testimony at trial, a woman was walking in Salinas after dropping off her\ncar for an oil change when she noticed a man (whom she identified as defendant) walking\ntoward her on the sidewalk. He appeared to be \u201carguing with someone [who] wasn\u2019t\nthere.\u201d As he came closer, the woman heard him yell something like: \u201c \u2018Leave me alone\nor I\u2019ll have to hurt someone like this nice woman.\u2019 \u201d The woman became concerned, but\ndecided to walk past. Immediately after passing him, the woman felt a tug on her purse\nand turned to see defendant grabbing the strap. A struggle ensued over the purse,\ndescribed by the woman as a tug of war. Defendant was stronger than the woman and\nshe was being pulled toward him. Defendant fell down but maintained his grip on the\npurse. The woman eventually let go because she was afraid he might have a weapon.\nDefendant fled, and the woman screamed for help. Multiple people called 911 to report\nthe crime, and recordings of those calls were admitted into evidence and played for the\njury.\n        A bystander testified to seeing a scuffle on the sidewalk between a man and a\nwoman as he drove past. He saw the man and woman both fall down and then the man\n(whom he also identified at trial as defendant) got up and ran away with a purse. The\nbystander drove after defendant and blocked his path with the car. He told defendant to\ngive him the purse and defendant complied. When he asked defendant why he took the\npurse defendant responded \u201c \u2018I\u2019m sick, I\u2019m sick.\u2019 \u201d\n        A police officer who responded to the 911 calls testified that he got out of his\npatrol car, approached defendant, and asked him if he had been involved in an incident\ninvolving a woman. Defendant initially denied any involvement, then told the officer he\nhad found the purse on the ground. Defendant eventually admitted he took the purse\nfrom the woman and stated that he took full responsibility for his actions, which he\nblamed on his heroin addiction. The officer testified that defendant was calm,\n                                              2\n\fcooperative, coherent, and appeared to understand all of the officer\u2019s questions.\nDefendant did not appear to be under the influence of any controlled substance. The\nofficer arrested defendant and advised him of his Miranda rights. (Miranda v. Arizona\n(1966) 384 U.S. 436.) While en route to the police station, defendant volunteered\n(without questioning by the officer) that he was glad he had been arrested because it\nmeant he could seek treatment for his heroin addiction. He also asked the officer to\napologize to the victim on his behalf and expressed hope that he did not hurt her.\n       Relevant to this appeal, the prosecution and defense each discussed the reasonable\ndoubt standard during closing argument. The prosecutor argued: \u201cwhen thinking about\nreasonable doubt, the key word there is \u2018reasonable.\u2019 And it\u2019s helpful to think about\nwhat ... reasonable doubt is not. It\u2019s not beyond all pcossible doubt. It\u2019s not beyond all\nimaginary doubt. And it\u2019s not to an absolute certainty. [\u00b6] It\u2019s what\u2019s reasonable.\nWhat\u2019s reasonable given all the evidence. What\u2019s reasonable given everything that you\nknow. And what\u2019s reasonable employing your common sense.\u201d\n       Defense counsel argued: \u201cYou need to make sure the decision you made today is\nan abiding conviction. ... That you don\u2019t have second guesses. That you don\u2019t regret the\ndecision you made today. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] Now, the standard of proof in this country in a\ncriminal setting is beyond a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s the highest standard in any arena in\na court in America. [\u00b6] To take your children away ... requires a standard of clear and\nconvincing evidence. To take your children away, it requires a lesser standard of clear\nand convincing evidence.\u201d The trial court sustained an objection by the prosecutor and\nadmonished the jury: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, I\u2019m going to instruct you to\ndisregard the last comments relating to children and the standard of law. That\u2019s stricken\nfrom the record.\u201d Defense counsel continued to address the reasonable doubt standard,\narguing \u201c[i]f one of you thinks it\u2019s an issue, that\u2019s a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s enough for\nyou to consider and say \u2018there is doubt here.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       The jury found defendant guilty of robbery, and he was sentenced to the low term\nof two years in prison.\n                                    II.   DISCUSSION\n   A. CLOSING ARGUMENT\n       Defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion and violated his federal\nconstitutional right to counsel by sustaining the objection to defense counsel\u2019s argument\nabout the clear and convincing evidence standard.\n       \u201cIt shall be the duty of the judge to control all proceedings during the trial, and to\nlimit the introduction of evidence and the argument of counsel to relevant and material\nmatters, with a view to the expeditious and effective ascertainment of the truth regarding\nthe matters involved.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1044.) The total denial of the opportunity for\ndefense counsel to provide closing argument is a violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s\nSixth Amendment. (Herring v. New York (1975) 422 U.S. 853, 858\u2013860.) But trial\ncourts retain \u201cgreat latitude in controlling the duration and limiting the scope\u201d of closing\nargument. (Id. at p. 862.) And the constitutional right to counsel \u201c \u2018is not infringed when\n\u201cthe opportunity [of the defense] to participate fully and fairly in the adversary\nfactfinding process\u201d [citation] is not significantly limited.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Memro (1995)\n11 Cal. 4th 786, 876.)\n       Defendant has not demonstrated that the trial court\u2019s decision to sustain one\nobjection during closing argument significantly limited counsel\u2019s ability to participate\nfully and fairly in the adversary process. Defense counsel was allowed to describe the\napplicable standard of proof both before and after the trial court sustained the objection at\nissue here. And the trial court did not deter counsel from the main defense argument that\nthe evidence was insufficient to support the force and specific intent elements of robbery.\nWe therefore find no federal constitutional violation.\n       As for defendant\u2019s state law claim, we review a trial court\u2019s exercise of its\nauthority to control proceedings under Penal Code section 1044 for abuse of discretion,\n                                              4\n\fand we review error in that exercise under the state law standard for prejudice: whether it\nis reasonably probable that defendant would have obtained a more favorable result had\nthe error not occurred. (People v. Chenault (2014) 227 Cal. App. 4th 1503, 1521.)\nDefendant acknowledges that \u201c \u2018it [is] for the judge, not counsel, to explain the law to the\njury.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting U.S. v. Kramer (7th Cir. 1983) 711 F.2d 789, 794 [finding no violation\nof the due process right to a fair trial where the trial judge forbade defense counsel from\ndefining reasonable doubt for the jury].) Defendant argues the prosecutor\u2019s description\nof the reasonable doubt standard was misleading and required clarification from defense\ncounsel. But the trial court instructed on the reasonable doubt standard and also properly\ninstructed\u2014both before closing argument and with multiple admonitions during\nargument\u2014that the jurors were to follow the law as the court described it even if the\nattorneys\u2019 comments conflicted with the court\u2019s instructions. (See CALCRIM No. 200.)\nThough defendant notes \u201cthe jury was not instructed on the law again\u201d after closing\nargument, there is no evidence the jurors lacked access during deliberations to a paper\ncopy of the instructions given. We presume the jury acted reasonably and followed the\ncourt\u2019s instructions. (People v. Cunningham (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 926, 1014.) Having\nproperly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt with CALCRIM No. 220, the trial court\ncould rationally view counsel\u2019s comparison of that standard to the inapplicable clear and\nconvincing evidence standard as potentially confusing to the jury. We acknowledge,\nhowever, that defense counsel\u2019s argument could also be viewed as a fair response to the\nprosecutor\u2019s characterization of reasonable doubt as \u201c[w]hat\u2019s reasonable given all of the\nevidence.\u201d\n       We need not conclusively determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in\nsustaining the objection because on this record the error would be harmless. The victim\u2019s\ntestimony about defendant pulling on the purse strap hard enough that she was pulled\ntoward him is sufficient evidence of force necessary to convict defendant of robbery.\nDefendant\u2019s flight once the woman let go of her purse is sufficient circumstantial\n                                             5\n\fevidence of defendant\u2019s specific intent to permanently deprive her of her property.\nThough defendant argues the asserted error would be prejudicial because his intent was a\nmaterial fact in dispute (based on the possibility that a mental disorder affected his ability\nto form a specific intent), his coherence when talking to the officer soon after the\nincident, as well as his request that the officer apologize to the victim, is strong\ncircumstantial evidence that his ability to form a specific intent had not been overcome\nby a mental disease, defect, or disorder. Defendant has not shown a reasonable\nprobability of a more favorable verdict had the jury been allowed to consider counsel\u2019s\nargument comparing the reasonable doubt standard to the clear and convincing evidence\nstandard.\n   B. MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION (PEN. CODE, \u00a7 1001.36)\n       After reviewing the parties\u2019 arguments in the related habeas matter (case\nNo. H045613), we sought supplemental briefing regarding defendant\u2019s entitlement to a\nmental health diversion eligibility hearing under Penal Code section 1001.36. Penal\nCode section 1001.36 allows for pretrial diversion for individuals diagnosed with\nqualifying mental disorders including, among other things, schizophrenia. To qualify for\ndiversion, a court must find that a defendant meets six criteria: the defendant suffers\nfrom a qualifying mental disorder; the disorder played a significant role in the\ncommission of the charged offense; a qualified expert has opined that the defendant\u2019s\nsymptoms are treatable; the defendant has consented to diversion and has waived his or\nher right to a speedy trial; the defendant agrees to treatment as a condition of diversion;\nand the defendant does not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(A)\u2013(b)(1)(F).)\n       In People v. Frahs (2020) 9 Cal. 5th 618 (Frahs), the Supreme Court considered\nwhether the mental health diversion statute applies retroactively to cases in which the\njudgment is not yet final under the reasoning of In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal. 2d 740\n(Estrada), and whether the proper remedy for a non-final judgment pending on appeal is\n                                               6\n\fto conditionally reverse the judgment and remand the matter for a diversion hearing. The\nSupreme Court concluded that Estrada applies to Penal Code section 1001.36, and\naffirmed the appellate court\u2019s \u201cdetermination that defendant is entitled to a limited\nremand for the trial court to decide whether he should receive diversion under [Penal\nCode] section 1001.36.\u201d (Frahs, at p. 625.)\n       The Attorney General argues that defendant is not entitled to a remand under\nPenal Code section 1001.36 \u201c[b]ecause there is no evidence appellant suffered from a\nqualifying mental disorder.\u201d But we find adequate evidence in the record to suggest that\ndefendant was suffering from a mental disorder when he committed the robbery. The\nvictim testified that defendant appeared to be arguing with someone who was not there\nand that he yelled: \u201c \u2018Leave me alone or I\u2019ll have to hurt someone like this nice\nwoman.\u2019 \u201d Indeed, there was enough evidence that the trial court instructed the jury with\nCALCRIM No. 3428 regarding the effect of a mental disease, defect, or disorder on the\ndefendant\u2019s ability to form the requisite intent or mental state.\n       Though it appears from the record that defendant is no longer in custody, we note\nthat this issue is not moot because defendant can still obtain relief. He is entitled to a\ndetermination of his eligibility for mental health diversion. If found eligible, in addition\nto access to mental health services, the charge in this case could eventually be dismissed\nupon satisfactory completion of diversion. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1001.36, subd. (e) [\u201cIf the\ndefendant has performed satisfactorily in diversion, at the end of the period of diversion,\nthe court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s criminal charges that were the subject of the\ncriminal proceedings at the time of the initial diversion.\u201d].) We will therefore\nconditionally reverse the judgment and remand for a mental health diversion eligibility\nhearing.\n                                   III.   DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is conditionally reversed and the matter is remanded with\ninstructions to conduct a mental health diversion eligibility hearing (Pen. Code,\n                                              7\n\f\u00a7 1001.36). If the trial court finds that defendant suffers from a mental disorder, does not\npose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and otherwise meets the six\nstatutory criteria (as nearly as possible given the postconviction procedural posture of this\ncase), the court may grant diversion. If defendant successfully completes diversion, then\nthe court shall dismiss the charges. However, if the court determines that defendant does\nnot meet the criteria under Penal Code section 1001.36, or if defendant does not\nsuccessfully complete diversion, then the conviction and sentence shall be reinstated.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                   ____________________________________\n                                   Grover, J.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n____________________________\nGreenwood, P.
