See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.02(a) (West Supp.\n\f2013). Bryant pleaded true to the enhancement allegation that he had previously\n\nbeen convicted of the felony offense of possession of a firearm, and the trial court\n\nassessed punishment of 12 years in prison. In a single appellate issue, Bryant\n\ncontends that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that\n\nthe ceramic plate used in the commission of the offense was a deadly weapon. We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      Carol Pitts married Ronnie Bryant on Valentine\u2019s Day 2012.               Bryant\n\nsuspected Pitts was having an affair, though she denied it. Two weeks after their\n\nwedding, they were sitting in bed, watching television, and eating dinner off of\n\ntrays. Pitts testified that Bryant was talking on the phone and then things \u201ctook\n\na . . . bizarre turn.\u201d She said, \u201c[I]t went from \u2018Hi, Honey,\u2019 to really bizarre in like\n\nthree minutes.\u201d Bryant told her, \u201cI\u2019m going to love you the way you love me,\u201d but\n\nPitts did not immediately understand what he meant. He came around to her side\n\nof the bed and grabbed her plate. As she put her arm up to block her face, he hit\n\nher arm with the plate, causing the plate to break. Her arm was lacerated, and she\n\nbegan bleeding heavily.\n\n      At trial, the prosecutor asked Pitts where Bryant was aiming when he\n\nassaulted her:\n\n      Q.     Where on your body was he aiming with the plate?\n\n                                          2\n\fA.     I don\u2019t know where he was aiming, but it hit my arm.\n\nQ.     Where was your arm? Was it laying down or was it up?\n\nA.     Just a defense mechanism. When he picked it up, I did this\n       (demonstrating).\n\nQ.     So your arm is blocking your face; is that right, for the record?\n\nA.     Uh-huh.\n\nQ.     We have to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, Ms. Pitts, I should\n       have told you that. So you were blocking your face with your\n       arm. Which arm was it?\n\nA.     This arm (indicating).\n\nQ.     Your right one?\n\n....\n\nA.     Yes.\n\n....\n\nQ.     You were blocking your face with your right arm. What did\u2014\n       did he have one hand or two hands on your plate?\n\nA.     Just one.\n\nQ.     Show with a motion with your hand the way the defendant\n       slammed the plate on you.\n\nA.     It came down like this and broke on my arm (demonstrating).\n\nQ.     So did he hit it in a motion that ended up hitting your arm, or\n       did he throw it somewhere else, or did he aim at you?\n\nA.     He aimed at me.\n\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\f      Pitts testified that Bryant then took a piece of the broken plate and motioned\n\n\u201clike he was going to stab me with it.\u201d Moments later, Bryant left the room,\n\nreturned with knife, and again made stabbing motions. Pitts testified, \u201cI thought he\n\nwas going to stab me with it.\u201d At that time, she was lying on the bed, bleeding\n\nprofusely, keeping her feet on Bryant\u2019s chest to keep him away. Pitts managed to\n\nget away from him, examine her wounds in the bathroom, and change her blood-\n\nsoaked clothing. She went outside, sat on the steps near her apartment, and called\n\n9-1-1 due to the excessive bleeding. At trial she testified that she called 9-1-1\n\nbecause she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\n      Within ten minutes of her phone call, Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy F.\n\nSalizar, Jr. arrived to find her sitting on the steps with her arm wrapped in a blood-\n\nsoaked towel and her hands covered in blood. Salizar said it looked like there was\n\none big cut on her arm but \u201c[i]t could have been more.\u201d He testified that she was\n\ncrying, \u201cvery distraught,\u201d \u201cvery upset,\u201d and \u201cin a state of shock.\u201d Pitts told Salizar\n\nthat Bryant assaulted her and cut her with a ceramic plate. She also told him that\n\nBryant \u201cjust took off running down the street\u201d when he saw the sheriff\n\napproaching.\n\n      After making sure that Bryant was not inside the couple\u2019s apartment, Salizar\n\njoined the search for him. Approximately 15 minutes after speaking to Pitts,\n\nSalizar found Bryant crouched behind a minivan parked in a nearby residential\n\n                                          4\n\farea. After identifying himself, Bryant said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing nothing. What are\n\nyou stopping me for?\u201d He was placed into a patrol car and taken to the apartment,\n\nwhere Pitts identified him before being taken by ambulance to the emergency\n\nroom.\n\n        Pitts spent three days in the hospital, where she underwent orthopedic\n\nsurgery. She had three cuts on her arm, two of which went all the way down to the\n\nbone. She also suffered joint damage.\n\n        Bryant was charged with aggravated assault on a family member. The\n\nindictment alleged that Bryant caused bodily injury to Pitts, a member of his\n\nfamily and household, by cutting her with a plate, and that he \u201cused and exhibited a\n\ndeadly weapon, namely a PLATE, during the commission of the offense.\u201d\n\n        The jury found Bryant guilty of aggravated assault as charged in the\n\nindictment. The trial court assessed punishment, and Bryant timely appealed.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n        In his sole issue, Bryant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury\u2019s finding that the plate was a deadly weapon. He argues that the\n\nplate itself was not a deadly weapon and it was only after the plate broke that it\n\nbecame capable of causing more than \u201csome blunt force trauma.\u201d\n\n        We review the legal sufficiency of the evidence by viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational trier of\n\n                                           5\n\ffact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2789 (1979);\n\nVodochodsky v. State, 158 S.W.3d 502, 509 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). The standard\n\nis the same for both direct and circumstantial evidence cases. King v. State, 895\n\nS.W.2d 701, 703 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995). The trier of fact is the sole judge of the\n\nweight and credibility of the evidence. See Lancon v. State, 253 S.W.3d 699, 707\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2008). We do not resolve any conflict of fact, weigh any\n\nevidence, or evaluate the credibility of any witnesses, as this was the function of\n\nthe trier of fact. See Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 740 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1999). We must resolve any inconsistencies in the evidence in favor of the verdict.\n\nCurry v. State, 30 S.W.3d 394, 406 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n      Under the Texas Penal Code, a person commits aggravated assault if he\n\n\u201cuses or exhibits a deadly weapon during the commission of [an] assault.\u201d TEX.\n\nPENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.02(a)(2) (West Supp. 2013). \u201cA weapon can be deadly by\n\ndesign or use.\u201d Tucker v. State, 274 S.W.3d 688, 691 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)\n\n(citing TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 1.07(a)(17) (West Supp. 2013). A ceramic plate\n\nis not a deadly weapon by design. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(A).\n\nBut an object may become a deadly weapon if \u201cin the manner of its use\u201d it \u201cis\n\ncapable of causing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(B). \u201c\u2018Serious\n\nbodily injury\u2019 means bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that\n\n                                        6\n\fcauses death, serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of\n\nthe function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1.07(a)(46). The State must\n\nprove only that in the manner of use the object was capable of causing death or\n\nserious bodily injury; it need not show that the object caused death or serious\n\nbodily injury. See Tucker, 274 S.W.3d at 691\u201392; McCain v. State, 22 S.W.3d\n\n497, 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). The statute \u201cdoes not require that the actor\n\nactually intend death or serious bodily injury; an object is a deadly weapon if the\n\nactor intends a use of the object in which it would be capable of causing death or\n\nserious bodily injury.\u201d McCain, 22 S.W.3d at 503.\n\n      Neither expert testimony nor a description of the weapon is required proof in\n\nevery case because \u201cthe injuries suffered by the victim can by themselves be a\n\nsufficient basis for inferring that a deadly weapon was used.\u201d Tucker, 274 S.W.3d\n\nat 691\u201392. In Morales v. State, 633 S.W.2d 866 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.]\n\n1982), the defendant was convicted of aggravated assault for cutting the\n\ncomplainant across her face. 633 S.W.2d at 867. The complainant testified that\n\nshe really did not see the object used to cut her; she said \u201cthat she just saw\n\nsomething shiny.\u201d Id. at 867\u201368. Another witness testified that she saw a knife,\n\nbut she could offer no details about the size and shape of the knife. Id. at 868. In\n\nconcluding that the knife used to cut the complainant was a deadly weapon, the\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals observed:\n\n                                         7\n\f             The manner of the weapon\u2019s use is not so elusive, however.\n      The photograph of the wound suffered by complainant shows a deep\n      slash from just underneath the complainant\u2019s earlobe across her cheek\n      to the corner of her mouth. The wound appears to be deep and has\n      been closed by numerous sutures.\n\n             Throughout its length, the wound is in close proximity to the\n      complainant\u2019s throat, starting approximately one to two inches above\n      the jawline and roughly parallel to it.\n\n             Although we cannot ascribe to common knowledge medical\n      knowledge such as the position and function of the jugular vein and\n      carotid artery, it is certainly common knowledge that the throat is a\n      particularly vulnerable part of the body, as exemplified by the popular\n      expression \u2018go for the throat.\u2019\n\nId.\n\n      In Harper v. State, 753 S.W.2d 516 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1988,\n\npet. ref\u2019d), the defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery when he invaded\n\nthe complainant\u2019s home and forced her to write him a check. 753 S.W.2d at 517.\n\nThe evidence showed that the complainant lost consciousness and awoke on the\n\nbathroom floor with a bloody head and surrounded by broken glass along with the\n\nstopper and the broken neck of a decanter. Id. at 517\u201318. The indictment alleged\n\nthat Harper used a cord, a knife, and a decanter as deadly weapons in the\n\ncommission of the crime. Id. at 517. On appeal, Harper challenged the finding\n\nthat the decanter was a deadly weapon. Id. at 517\u201318. The court of appeals noted\n\nthat the complainant was hospitalized for several days due to her injuries. Id. at\n\n518. Because fragments of the decanter were found in the bathroom, the court\n\n                                        8\n\fconcluded, \u201cIt was reasonable for the jury to conclude from the cut on [the\n\ncomplainant\u2019s] head and the broken glass that [Harper] struck her with the\n\ndecanter. It was also reasonable for the jury to conclude that a glass decanter,\n\nwhen used in such a manner, was a deadly weapon.\u201d Id.\n\n      In this case Pitts testified that she had raised her arm to shield her face when\n\nBryant hit her with a ceramic plate using sufficient force to damage her joint and\n\nbreak the plate.    In addition, Pitts sustained three lacerations to her arm.\n\nPhotographs of her injury, the blood-soaked towel, and pools of blood inside and\n\noutside her apartment were admitted into evidence at trial. Pitts testified that she\n\nspent three days in the hospital and underwent orthopedic surgery as a result of her\n\ninjuries, and hospital medical records were admitted into evidence at trial. A\n\nrational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the ceramic\n\nplate, used in the manner in which Bryant used it on Pitts, was capable of causing\n\n\u201cpermanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any\n\nbodily member or organ,\u201d as, for example, if it had struck Pitts on the face or eye.\n\nTEX.
