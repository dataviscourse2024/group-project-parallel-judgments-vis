MCL 750.529. The trial court sentenced Brown as a\nfourth-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.12, to serve 15 to 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. We\naffirm.\n\n                                    I. BACKGROUND FACTS\n\n       Shanekia Melton testified about the robbery of a Dollar General store pursuant to a plea\nagreement. According to Melton, she was dating defendant\u2019s cousin, Jakayla Atchison, and\nMelton lived with defendant, Atchison, and defendant\u2019s cousin Artis Holmes. In December\n2013, Melton and defendant discussed robbing a nearby Dollar General store. Atchison testified\nthat she overheard Melton talking with defendant and another man, Shammon Mos, about\nrobbing the Dollar General store about two days before the robbery and thought it was a joke.\n\n       According to Melton, she, defendant, Mos, and Zachariah Coats-Brewer robbed the\nDollar General store at about 9:45 p.m. on December 18, 2013. They all wore gloves and face\ncoverings. The group waited until there were no customers inside the store, then Melton opened\nthe door and they all ran in. Defendant brandished a plastic gun and asked the workers to give\nhim money out of the safe. Coats-Brewer stood by the entrance while Melton and defendant\ntook cash.\n\n        Corrissa Archer testified that she was working at the Doller General store at the time of\nthe robbery. According to Archer, the robbers wore masks and she could not see their faces. A\nman approached Archer, pointed a gun at her, and asked for the safe. When Archer responded\nthat only the manager could open the safe, two of the men took her to the manager\u2019s office and\nbroke down the door. Terri Richards, the manager, testified that she put money from the safe\n\n                                               -1-\n\finto a bag for the man with the gun, who was about 5\u20197\u201d or 5\u20198\u201d tall, while a woman \u201cransacked\u201d\nthe office. The Department of Corrections\u2019 records indicate that defendant is 5\u20199\u201d tall.\n\n        Albion Police Officer Mike Kolassa obtained surveillance footage from the store, which\nwas entered into evidence and played for the jury. According to Detective Luis Tejada, he\nreviewed the security video but was not able to identify the suspects. However, after Archer told\nan officer she suspected that Melton was one of the robbers, he reviewed the video again and\nrealized that one of the robbers wore pants similar to pants that he had seen Melton wear.\nDetective Tejeda suspected that Holmes may have participated in the robbery because he lived\nwith Melton and had previously robbed a Dollar General store. However, after further\nconsideration, Detective Tejeda ruled out Holmes as a suspect because of the sizes and heights of\nthe people in the video.\n\n         On cross-examination, Melton testified that she had initially lied to police when she\ndenied involvement in the robbery. However, Melton testified that she realized that police could\npossibly prove she was involved in the robbery. Melton was offered a plea deal if she agreed to\ntestify, under which she would be charged with larceny from the person, a ten-year felony,\ninstead of armed robbery, which had a maximum sentence of life in prison. After she found out\nthat she could face life in prison, she began \u201ctelling on everybody.\u201d When asked whether she\nwould rather lie or serve life in prison, Melton responded, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do life.\u201d\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Melton was lying about defendant\u2019s involvement and that\nHolmes was actually involved in the robbery. The jury found defendant guilty as described\nabove.\n\n                           II. GREAT WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n      Defendant contends his conviction is against the great weight of the evidence because\nMelton\u2019s testimony was too incredible to support his conviction. We disagree.\n\n         A jury\u2019s verdict is against the great weight of the evidence if the evidence \u201cpreponderates\nso heavily against the verdict that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow the verdict to\nstand.\u201d People v Cameron, 291 Mich. App. 599, 617; 806 NW2d 371 (2011). Generally, this\nCourt reviews the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.\nPeople v McCray, 245 Mich. App. 631, 637; 630 NW2d 633 (2001). However, defendant did not\nraise this issue before the trial court. To preserve a claim that a verdict was against the great\nweight of the evidence, the defendant must move for a new trial before the trial court. Cameron,\n291 Mich. App. at 617. Because defendant has not preserved this claim, we will review it for\nplain error affecting his substantial rights. People v Carines, 460 Mich. 750, 763; 597 NW2d 130\n(1999). An error is plain if it was clear or obvious, and it affected the defendant\u2019s substantial\nrights if it affected the outcome of his or her trial. Id.\n\n        Identity is an element of every offense. People v Yost, 278 Mich. App. 341, 356; 749\nNW2d 753 (2008). This Court does not generally decide questions involving the credibility of\nidentification testimony on appeal. People v Lemmon, 456 Mich. 625, 636; 576 NW2d 129\n(1998). We will only overturn a credibility determination if the testimony contradicts\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\findisputable physical facts or laws, defies physical realities, is inherently implausible, or is\n\u201cseriously impeached\u201d in a case \u201cmarked by uncertainties and discrepancies.\u201d Id. at 643-644.\n\n        In this case, defense counsel elicited that Melton had reasons to dislike defendant,\nincluding that he owed her money, and had threatened her regarding her relationship with\nAtchison, that she had received a considerable plea deal for her testimony that reduced her\npotential sentence from life in prison, and that Melton would rather lie than face life\nimprisonment. However, the case was not marked with uncertainties and discrepancies.\nAtchison\u2019s and Archer\u2019s testimonies corroborated Melton\u2019s testimony, and the jury was also able\nto review the surveillance tape and consider defendant\u2019s height and frame in the courtroom. We\nconclude that Melton\u2019s testimony was not so seriously impeached that we must overturn the\njury\u2019s credibility determination.\n\n                           III. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT\n\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by denigrating the\ndefense. We disagree.\n\n        A prosecutor can deny a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by making improper remarks that\ninfringe on a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights or by making remarks that \u201cso infect[] the trial\nwith unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d Donnelly v\nDeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643; 94 S. Ct. 1868; 40 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1974). See People v Bahoda,\n448 Mich. 261, 266-267; 531 NW2d 659 (1995). We must evaluate instances of prosecutorial\nmisconduct on a case-by-case basis, reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s comments in context, and in light\nof the defendant\u2019s arguments and the evidence presented in the case. People v Dobek, 274 Mich\nApp 58, 64; 732 NW2d 546 (2007).\n\n        The prosecutor may not \u201cdenigrat[e] a defendant with intemperate and prejudicial\nremarks.\u201d Bahoda, 448 Mich. at 283. The prosecutor may also not suggest that defense counsel\nis attempting to mislead the jury. People v Unger, 278 Mich. App. 210, 236; 749 NW2d 272\n(2008).\n\n              The prosecutor may not question defense counsel\u2019s veracity. When the\n       prosecutor argues that the defense counsel himself is intentionally trying to\n       mislead the jury, he is in effect stating that defense counsel does not believe his\n       own client. This argument undermines the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence.\n       Such an argument impermissibly shifts the focus from the evidence itself to the\n       defense counsel\u2019s personality. [Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).]\n\n       In this case, defense counsel used an elaborate story involving a castle, a princess, and a\nman swimming across a moat to illustrate the point that, without Melton\u2019s testimony, there\nwould be no case against defendant. During rebuttal, the prosecution made the following\nstatements:\n\n       [Prosecutor]: . . . All right, Ladies and Gentlemen, the medieval stories, those\n       things all very cute and clever, Ladies and Gentlemen. And again, I have all the\n       respect in the world for [defense counsel], and he\u2019s doing exactly what he\u2019s paid\n       to do; however, at the end of the day, the facts are the facts. He can . . .\n                                               -3-\n\f                                              ***\n\n       [Defense Counsel]:     I\u2019m going to object, Judge. We are both paid to be here.\n\n       The Court:     Well, that\u2019s regardless. Go ahead, [prosecutor].\n\n       [Prosecutor]: Thank you. At the end of the day, the facts are the facts, and\n       distorting the facts and calling [Melton] and raising your voice saying, \u201cShe\u2019s a\n       liar, she\u2019s a thief, don\u2019t believe her,\u201d you can say that all day long, but the facts\n       are what they are, Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that defense counsel was \u201cdoing\nexactly what he\u2019s paid to do\u201d was improper. We agree that the remark was improper, but we\nconclude that it did not deprive defendant of a fair trial.\n\n        First, we conclude that this error was not of constitutional magnitude. \u201c[I]n order for\nprosecutorial misconduct to be constitutional error, the misconduct must have so infected the\ntrial with unfairness as to make the conviction a deprivation of liberty without due process of\nlaw.\u201d People v Blackmon, 280 Mich. App. 253, 269; 761 NW2d 172 (2008) (emphasis omitted).\nA brief, isolated, and uninflammatory comment is not highly prejudicial. See People v Watson,\n245 Mich. App. 572, 591; 629 NW2d 411 (2001). In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s remark was a\nsingle, isolated comment. It was improper, but not highly inflammatory. We conclude that the\nprosecutor\u2019s improper remark did not infect the trial with unfairness.\n\n        We also conclude that the error did not likely affect the outcome of defendant\u2019s trial. \u201cA\npreserved, nonconstitutional error is not a ground for reversal unless after an examination of the\nentire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that it is more probable than not that the error was\noutcome determinative.\u201d People v Lukity, 460 Mich. 484, 495-496; 596 NW2d 607 (1999)\n(quotation marks omitted). As noted above, the remark was brief and isolated. It began with a\nproper response to defense counsel\u2019s argument, and the prosecutor promptly refocused on the\nfacts of the case after defense counsel\u2019s challenge. Additionally, we note that the trial court\nproperly instructed the jury that it could not rest its verdict \u201cin any way\u201d on the attorneys\u2019\nclosing arguments. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remark does not constitute\nreversible error in this case.\n\n                            IV. NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE\n\n        In a March 3, 2015 affidavit, \u201cZachariah Segtaun Brewer\u201d averred that defendant \u201cwas\nnot present nor participated in the event.\u201d Coats-Brewer offered this affidavit after he was\nconvicted of larceny in a building. Defendant contends that (1) the affidavit constitutes newly\ndiscovered exculpatory evidence that warrants a new trial, and (2) defense counsel was\nineffective for failing to discover and call Coats-Brewer as an exculpatory witness. We disagree.\n\n       We note that defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence issue is unpreserved because\ndefendant did not move for a new trial in the trial court. See People v Darden, 230 Mich App\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f597, 605-606; 585 NW2d 27 (1998). Additionally, when the trial court has not conducted a\nGinther1 hearing, this Court reviews the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nfor errors apparent on the record. People v Heft, 299 Mich. App. 69, 80; 829 NW2d 266 (2012).\n\n        We also note that defendant\u2019s arguments are directly contradictory. Defendant contends\nthat exculpatory evidence provided by Coats-Brewer is newly discovered because Coats-Brewer\nwould have been unavailable to testify at trial on the basis of his right against self-incrimination,\nbut then contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and call Coats-Brewer at\ntrial. If Coats-Brewer was unavailable at trial, counsel could not have called him to testify.\nRegardless of their inconsistency, we will address defendant\u2019s arguments.\n\n        \u201c[A] codefendant\u2019s posttrial or postconviction testimony does not constitute newly\ndiscovered evidence sufficient to warrant a new trial when the defendant was aware of the\nevidence before trial\u201d because such testimony \u201cis not newly discovered, but merely newly\navailable.\u201d People v Terrell, 289 Mich. App. 553, 567; 797 NW2d 684 (2010). In this case,\nCoats-Brewer\u2019s involvement in the robbery was not new information. Melton implicated him in\nthe robbery and later testified that he was involved. This evidence was available at trial and is\nmerely newly available following Coats-Brewer\u2019s conviction. Additionally, we conclude that\nCoats-Brewer\u2019s affidavit does not make it more likely than not that no reasonable juror would\nhave found defendant guilty. See People v Swain, 288 Mich. App. 609, 638; 794 NW2d 92\n(2010) (discussing actual innocence). We reject defendant\u2019s contention that Coats-Brewer\u2019s\naffidavit constitutes newly discovered evidence or evidence of actual innocence.\n\n        We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that defense counsel failed to reasonably\ninvestigate and call Coats-Brewer.\n\n        A criminal defendant has the fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel. US\nConst, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20; United States v Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 654; 104 S. Ct. 2039;\n80 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1984). To prove that his defense counsel was not effective, the defendant must\nshow that (1) defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\nand (2) there is a reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the\ndefendant. Strickland v Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694; 104 S. Ct. 2052; 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984);\nPeople v Pickens, 446 Mich. 298, 302-303; 521 NW2d 797 (1994). The defendant must establish\nthe factual predicate for a claim of ineffective assistance. People v Hoag, 460 Mich. 1, 6; 594\nNW2d 57 (1999).\n\n        Defense counsel\u2019s decisions to call and investigate witnesses are matters of trial strategy.\nPeople v Horn, 279 Mich. App. 31, 39; 755 NW2d 212 (2008). This Court must strongly presume\nthat defense counsel acted professionally and pursued a sound trial strategy. People v LeBlanc,\n465 Mich. 575, 578; 640 NW2d 246 (2002).\n\n      In this case, the record is devoid of any indication that counsel failed to investigate Coats-\nBrewer. Coats-Brewer\u2019s affidavit does not provide evidence that defense counsel failed to\n\n\n1\n    People v Ginther, 390 Mich. 436, 443, 212 NW2d 922 (1973).\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fcontact him. We conclude that defendant has failed to establish that counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness. Defendant has failed to overcome the strong\npresumption that counsel reasonably investigated Coats-Brewer and failed to call him for a\nsound reason\u2014such as that Coats-Brewer would have exercised his right not to incriminate\nhimself.\n\n                                       V. SENTENCING\n\n        Defendant contends that the trial court improperly scored offense variable (OV) 14 when\nit determined that defendant was a leader in the robbery. We disagree.\n\n        \u201cUnder the sentencing guidelines, the circuit court\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed\nfor clear error and must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d People v Hardy, 494\nMich. 430, 438; 835 NW2d 340 (2013). A finding is clearly erroneous if, after reviewing the\nentire record, we are definitely and firmly convinced that the trial court made a mistake. People\nv Reese, 491 Mich. 127, 139; 815 NW2d 85 (2012).\n\n       The trial court should assess 10 points under OV 14 if \u201c[t]he offender was a leader in a\nmultiple offender situation.\u201d MCL 777.44(1). If three or more offenders are involved in a\nrobbery, it can have multiple leaders. MCL 777.44(2)(b). Leading includes directing or\nconducting other participants in the offense. People v Rhodes (On Remand), 305 Mich. App. 85,\n90; 849 NW2d 417 (2014). But a defendant\u2019s exclusive possession of a gun, standing alone,\ndoes not support an assessment under OV 14. Id.\n\n        We are not definitely and firmly convinced that the trial court made a mistake when it\nfound that defendant was a leader during the robbery. As well as defendant\u2019s possession of the\nsole gun, Melton testified that defendant helped plan the robbery. Defendant asked for the\nmoney, Melton and defendant were the two people who accompanied Richardson in the\nmanager\u2019s office, and defendant carried the money away from the scene. We conclude that a\npreponderance of the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant was a\nleader in the robbery.\n\n       We affirm.\n\n                                                            /s/ Peter D. O\u2019Connell\n                                                            /s/ Donald S. Owens\n                                                            /s/ Jane M.
