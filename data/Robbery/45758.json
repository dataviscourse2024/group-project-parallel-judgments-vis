No. S-20-813.\n\n                 1. Summary Judgment: Appeal and Error. An appellate court affirms a\n                    lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment if the pleadings and admitted\n                    evidence show that there is no genuine issue as to any material facts or\n                    as to the ultimate inferences that may be drawn from the facts and that\n                    the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n                 2. ____: ____. An appellate court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of sum-\n                    mary judgment de novo, viewing the record in the light most favorable\n                    to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that\n                    party\u2019s favor.\n                 3. Immunity: Jurisdiction. Sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature,\n                    and courts have a duty to determine whether they have subject matter\n                    jurisdiction over a matter.\n                 4. Jurisdiction: Statutes. Subject matter jurisdiction and statutory inter-\n                    pretation present questions of law.\n                 5. Judgments: Appeal and Error. An appellate court independently\n                    reviews questions of law decided by a lower court.\n                 6. Judgments: Jurisdiction: Appeal and Error. A jurisdictional question\n                    which does not involve a factual dispute is determined by an appellate\n                    court as a matter of law, which requires the appellate court to reach a\n                    conclusion independent from the lower court\u2019s decision.\n                 7. Sentences: Statutes: Time. The good time law to be applied to a\n                    defend\u00adant\u2019s sentence is the law in effect at the time the defendant\u2019s sen-\n                    tence becomes final.\n                 8. Jurisdiction: Appeal and Error. Where a lower court lacks subject\n                    matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of a claim, issue, or question,\n                    an appellate court also lacks the power to determine the merits of the\n                    claim, issue, or question presented to the lower court.\n\f                                    - 481 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     312 Nebraska Reports\n               HEIST V.

The Administrative Procedure Act provides a limited statu-\n    tory waiver of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity and confers subject matter\n    jurisdiction for a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination\n    regarding the validity of a state agency\u2019s rule or regulation.\n10. Administrative Law: Words and Phrases. The Administrative\n    Procedure Act defines a \u201crule or regulation\u201d as any standard of general\n    application adopted by an agency in accordance with the authority con-\n    ferred by statute.\n11. Administrative law. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a rule or\n    regulation shall not include internal procedural documents which pro-\n    vide guidance to staff on agency organization and operations, lacking\n    the force of law, and not relied upon to bind the public.\n12. Administrative Law: Jurisdiction: Declaratory Judgments: Statutes.\n    The Administrative Procedure Act does not confer jurisdiction for\n    declaratory relief concerning judicial interpretation of a statute.\n13. Declaratory Judgments: Immunity: Waiver. Nebraska\u2019s Uniform\n    Declaratory Judgments Act does not waive the State\u2019s sovereign\n    immunity.\n14. Declaratory Judgments: Public Officers and Employees: Immunity.\n    A declaratory judgment action against a state officer or agent seeking\n    relief from an invalid act or an abuse of authority by an officer or agent\n    is not a suit against the State and is therefore not barred by the prin-\n    ciples of sovereign immunity.\n15. Statutes: Appeal and Error. Statutory language is to be given its plain\n    and ordinary meaning, and an appellate court will not resort to inter-\n    pretation to ascertain the meaning of statutory words which are plain,\n    direct, and unambiguous.\n16. Statutes: Legislature: Intent. Components of a series or collection of\n    statutes pertaining to a certain subject matter are in pari materia and\n    should be conjunctively considered and construed to determine the\n    intent of the Legislature, so that different provisions are consistent, har-\n    monious, and sensible.\n17. ____: ____: ____. In order for a court to inquire into a statute\u2019s legisla-\n    tive history, that statute in question must be open to construction, and a\n    statute is open to construction when its terms require interpretation or\n    may reasonably be considered ambiguous.\n18. Statutes. The statutory canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n    recognizes that an expressed object of a statute\u2019s operation excludes the\n    statute\u2019s operation on all other objects unmentioned by the statute.\n\f                                    - 482 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    312 Nebraska Reports\n               HEIST V.

Where a mandatory minimum sentence is involved, an\n    inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date is calculated by subtracting the manda-\n    tory minimum sentence from the court\u2019s minimum sentence, halving the\n    difference, and adding that difference to the mandatory minimum.\n20. Statutes: Legislature: Presumptions: Intent. In construing a statute,\n    it is presumed that the Legislature intended a sensible, rather than an\n    absurd, result.\n21. Statutes. Under the absurd results doctrine, a court may deviate from\n    the plain language of the statutory text if application of the plain lan-\n    guage would lead to manifest absurdity.\n22. ____. The absurd results doctrine does not include substantive errors\n    arising from a drafter\u2019s failure to appreciate the effect of certain statu-\n    tory provisions.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: John\nA.

Heist II, an inmate in the Nebraska Department of\nCorrectional Services (DCS) system, appeals the dismissal of\nhis petition for declaratory judgment under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA) and Nebraska\u2019s Uniform Declaratory\nJudgments Act (UDJA). Heist argues that good time credit\nearned pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b) (Cum.\nSupp. 2020) applies to an inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date\n(PED). In affirming the decision of the district court, we con-\nclude that good time earned pursuant to \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b) is\napplicable only to reduce an inmate\u2019s maximum sentence and,\naccordingly, has no applicability to an inmate\u2019s PED.\n\f                             - 483 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  312 Nebraska Reports\n            HEIST V.

Factual Background\n   On April 4, 2016, Heist was sentenced to imprisonment\nfor a minimum of 11 years (with a mandatory minimum of 3\nyears) and a maximum of 25 years in the DCS system for child\nenticement. According to DCS records, Heist\u2019s PED is March\n30, 2023, and DCS\u2019 brief on appeal gives his tentative release\ndate (TRD) as February 10, 2030.\n   Since his incarceration, Heist has been earning good time\ncredit under \u00a7 83-1,107. It is undisputed that the reductions\nof Heist\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 83-1,107 have been, and continue\nto be, deducted from the maximum term of his sentence to\ncalculate the date when discharge from state custody becomes\nmandatory. It further appears that, currently, no reductions have\nbeen applied to Heist\u2019s minimum sentence, mandatory mini-\nmum sentence, or PED.\n                      2. DCS Policy 104.08\n   DCS has adopted \u201cPolicy 104.08,\u201d which is titled \u201cInmate\nTime Calculations and Sentencing.\u201d The stated purpose of\nDCS\u2019 Policy 104.08 is to \u201coutlin[e] methodology for calcu-\nlating inmate\u2019s sentences.\u201d As to procedures for inmate time\ncomputations, Policy 104.08 notes that there are seven separate\nNebraska laws that govern the release of all inmates commit-\nted to DCS and explains that \u201c[t]hese statutes, along with the\nopinions of Nebraska courts and the state Attorney General\u2019s\noffice, form the basis of all time calculations.\u201d The first\nNebraska law identified is 2011 Neb. Laws, L.B. 191, which\nPolicy 104.08 describes as follows:\n         A. Effective March 16, 2011, LB 191 amended sections\n      83-1,107 and 83-1,108\n         1. LB 191 added an opportunity [for a committed\n      offender] to earn additional good time based on institu-\n      tional behavior. [DCS] will reduce the term of a commit-\n      ted inmate by three days on the first day of each month,\n      following a 12-month period of incarceration within\n\f                             - 484 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  312 Nebraska Reports\n            HEIST V.

SERVS.\n                        Cite as 312 Neb. 480\n\n     [DCS], during which the inmate has not been found guilty\n     of a Class I or Class II offense, or more than three Class\n     III offenses under [DCS\u2019] disciplinary code. Reductions\n     earned pursuant to LB 191 shall not be subject to forfeit\n     or withholding by [DCS].\n\n                      3. Procedural Facts\n   Heist filed a petition against DCS, Scott Frakes in his offi-\ncial capacity as DCS director, Mickie Baum in her official\ncapacity as DCS records administrator, and Candace Bottorf\nin her official capacity as DCS agency legal counsel (here-\ninafter collectively DCS) for declaratory judgment under\nthe APA and the UDJA. Heist alleged that Policy 104.08\nimproperly withholds L.B. 191 good time from PEDs. He\nalso argued that Policy 104.08 is a rule or regulation for pur-\nposes of the APA and is not authorized by the language of\n\u00a7 83-1,107 and Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 83-1,110 (Reissue 2014).\nDCS filed a motion to dismiss which, by agreement and\nnotice to both parties, was converted to a motion for sum-\nmary judgment. Heist subsequently filed a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment.\n   In October 2020, the district court entered an order sustain-\ning DCS\u2019 motion, overruling Heist\u2019s motion, and dismissing\nHeist\u2019s complaint. The court concluded that it lacked jurisdic-\ntion over Heist\u2019s APA claim, because Policy 104.08 was not a\nrule or regulation as defined by Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-901 (Cum.\nSupp. 2020) and the State did not waive its sovereign immu-\nnity. The court further concluded that DCS was entitled to\nsummary judgment on the UDJA claim, because Policy 104.08\naccurately outlines how sentences are to be calculated pursu-\nant to Nebraska law and Heist\u2019s PED was correctly calculated.\nHeist appeals.\n   Heist filed a petition to bypass review by the Nebraska\nCourt of Appeals, asserting the case involves an issue of first\nimpression in Nebraska. We granted the petition to bypass and\nmoved the case to our docket.\n\f                                  - 485 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     312 Nebraska Reports\n               HEIST V.

ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Heist assigns, restated and consolidated, that the district\ncourt erred in (1) finding that DCS Policy 104.08 is an internal\nprocedural document and thus concluding that it lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction over his APA claim; (2) granting summary\njudgment in favor of DCS on his UDJA claim, when Nebraska\nlaw requires application of good time credit earned under\n\u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b) to PEDs; and (3) finding that 62 inmates hav-\ning a PED after their respective TRD, which is colloquially\nreferred to as an \u201cinverted sentence,\u201d is not so absurd that the\nLegislature could not have intended \u00a7 83-1,107 to be inter-\npreted as applying only to the maximum sentence.\n                 IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] An appellate court affirms a lower court\u2019s grant of\nsummary judgment if the pleadings and admitted evidence\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material facts or\nas to the ultimate inferences that may be drawn from the facts\nand that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. 1 An appellate court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of\nsummary judgment de novo, viewing the record in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reason-\nable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. 2\n   [3-5] Sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature, and\ncourts have a duty to determine whether they have subject mat-\nter jurisdiction over a matter. 3 Subject matter jurisdiction and\nstatutory interpretation present questions of law. 4 An appellate\ncourt independently reviews questions of law decided by a\nlower court. 5\n   [6] A jurisdictional question which does not involve a fac-\ntual dispute is determined by an appellate court as a matter of\n1\n    Lassalle v.

ANALYSIS\n   [7] As an initial matter, we note that the good time law to be\napplied to a defendant\u2019s sentence is the law in effect at the time\nthe defendant\u2019s sentence becomes final. 7 Because Heist was\nsentenced in 2016, L.B. 191 is the applicable law governing\nhis sentence. Prior to the enactment of L.B. 191, \u00a7 83-1,107\nreduced an inmate\u2019s sentence by 6 months for each year of\nthe inmate\u2019s term. L.B. 191 amended \u00a7 83-1,107 to allow an\ninmate to earn additional good time at the rate of 3 days per\nmonth after completion of 1 year of incarceration so long as\nthe offender did not commit certain offenses under DCS\u2019 disci-\nplinary code. Section 83-1,107(2) now reads as follows:\n      (a) [DCS] shall reduce the term of a committed offender\n      by six months for each year of the offender\u2019s term and\n      pro rata for any part thereof which is less than a year.\n         (b) In addition to reductions granted in subdivision\n      (2)(a) of this section, [DCS] shall reduce the term of a\n      committed offender by three days on the first day of each\n      month following a twelve-month period of incarceration\n      within [DCS] during which the offender has not been\n      found guilty of (i) a Class I or Class II offense or (ii)\n      more than three Class III offenses under [DCS\u2019] discipli\u00ad\n      nary code. Reductions earned under this subdivision shall\n      not be subject to forfeit or withholding by [DCS].\n         (c) The total reductions under this subsection shall be\n      credited from the date of sentence, which shall include\n      any term of confinement prior to sentence and com-\n      mitment as provided pursuant to section 83-1,106, and\n      shall be deducted from the maximum term, to determine\n      the date when discharge from the custody of the state\n      becomes mandatory.\n6\n    US Ecology v.

Stat. \u00a7 83-1,108 (Reissue\n2014) to require that the Board of Parole reduce a parolee\u2019s\nparole term for good conduct while under parole by 10 days\nfor each month. Such reduction shall be deducted from the\nmaximum term, less good time granted pursuant to \u00a7 83-1,107,\nto determine the date when discharge from parole becomes\nmandatory.\n   As briefly discussed above, DCS inmates may accrue two\ndifferent good time credits under \u00a7 83-1,107. However, the\ncentral issue in this case involves good time credits earned\npursuant to \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b). As such, we decline to dis-\ncuss the implications of good time credits earned pursuant to\n\u00a7 83-1,107(2)(a).\n                         1. APA Claim\n   [8] Before reaching the legal import of \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b)\nand Policy 104.08, it is our duty to determine whether we\nhave jurisdiction over this matter. 8 Where a lower court lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of a claim,\nissue, or question, an appellate court also lacks the power to\ndetermine the merits of the claim, issue, or question presented\nto the lower court. 9\n   Heist argues that the district court erred in determining that\nPolicy 104.08 is not a rule or regulation and, thus, also in\ndetermining that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate whether\nthe policy exceeds DCS\u2019 statutory authority. Specifically, Heist\nmaintains Policy 104.08 is a rule or regulation because it\nprescribes penalties, affects private rights, and sets its own\nstandards for calculating good time. He also maintains it has\nthe force of law, as shown by DCS\u2019 \u201c[p]ast practice\u201d in releas-\ning approximately 300 inmates prematurely. 10 DCS disagrees,\narguing that Policy 104.08 is an internal procedural document\n 8\n     See Butler Cty.

Stat. \u00a7 84-911 (Reissue 2014), the APA provides a limited\nstatutory waiver of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity and confers\nsubject matter jurisdiction for a declaratory judgment action\nseeking a determination regarding the validity of a state agen-\ncy\u2019s rule or regulation. 12 This waiver applies only to a \u201crule\nor regulation,\u201d which the APA defines to mean \u201cany standard\nof general application adopted by an agency in accordance\nwith the authority conferred by statute.\u201d 13 The APA further\nprovides that the term \u201crule or regulation\u201d shall not include\n\u201cinternal procedural documents which provide guidance to\nstaff on agency organization and operations, lacking the force\nof law, and not relied upon to bind the public.\u201d 14 However, it\nalso provides that \u201cevery standard which prescribes a penalty\nshall be presumed to have general applicability and any stan-\ndard affecting private rights, private interests, or procedures\navailable to the public is presumed to be relied upon to bind\nthe public.\u201d 15\n   Specifically, Heist asserts that language in sections I.B.3,\nI.D.3, I.E.3, I.F.5, I.G.3, and I.H.5 of Policy 104.08, calling for\ngood time reductions to be forfeited or withheld for miscon-\nduct, prescribes penalties, and as such, he maintains that Policy\n104.08 is a rule or regulation.

The\nother sections pertain to good time under earlier statutes whose\napplication Heist does not challenge. As such, we focus our\ndiscussion on section I.A.1.\n   Section I.A.1 essentially restates \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b) when it\ncalls for inmates\u2019 terms to be reduced by 3 days on the first\nday of each month, following a 12-month period of incarcera-\ntion within DCS, during which the inmate has not been found\nguilty of a Class I or II offense, or more than three Class III\noffenses, under DCS\u2019 disciplinary code, and provides that any\nsuch good time shall not be subject to forfeiture or withholding\nby DCS. The only differences between the policy here and the\nstatute are immaterial; for example, section I.A.1 uses \u201cNDCS\u201d\nand \u201cwill,\u201d while the statute uses \u201cthe department\u201d and \u201cshall.\u201d\nAside from these minute differences, DCS neither added any-\nthing to nor removed anything from the statutory language\nwhen restating it in the policy. As such, the purported penalties\nand provisions affecting private rights that Heist points to do\nnot mean that Policy 104.08 is a rule or regulation. In fact, to\nthe contrary, they indicate that Policy 104.08 is a prototypical\ninternal procedural document insofar as it provides guidance to\nstaff by summarizing the seven statutes relevant to the release\nof all DCS inmates and explaining their effect.\n   [12] Allowing Heist to challenge Policy 104.08 under the\nAPA simply because it restates statutory language that could be\nseen to prescribe penalties or affect private rights would negate\nour holding in Perryman v.

Nothing in the APA\u2019s definition of \u201crule or regulation\u201d\nsuggests that a document\u2019s denomination as a \u201cpolicy\u201d or\n\u201cmemorandum\u201d is dispositive. The same is true as to whether\nthe document affects all inmates or a subset of inmates.\nMoreover, as we have already noted, the policy merely restates\ngood time calculations set forth in the statute; it does not pre-\nscribe a penalty. Further, the question of whether the policy\nexceeds DCS\u2019 statutory authority is an argument on the merits\nwhich cannot be reached under Heist\u2019s APA claim, because\nwe lack subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, we agree with the\ndistrict court and conclude that Policy 104.08 is not a rule or\n17\n     Id.\n18\n     Id.\n19\n     Id. at 69, 568 N.W.2d at 244.\n20\n     Id. at 70, 568 N.W.2d at 245.\n21\n     Brief for appellant at 12.\n\f                                   - 491 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      312 Nebraska Reports\n                HEIST V.

The\nlimited waiver of sovereign immunity does not confer juris-\ndiction for declaratory relief concerning judicial interpretation\nof a statute. Accordingly, the district court correctly found\nthat it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the APA in\nHeist\u2019s petition against DCS, because the State did not waive\nits sovereign immunity.\n\n                         2. UDJA Claim\n   Heist also argues that the district court erred in grant-\ning summary judgment in favor of DCS on his UDJA claim,\nbecause Nebraska law requires that good time credit earned\nunder \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b) apply to PEDs. DCS counters that the\nplain language of \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(c) clearly indicates that good\ntime earned under \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b) is only to be deducted from\nan inmate\u2019s maximum term to determine when discharge from\nstate custody becomes mandatory.\n   [13,14] As an initial matter, we note that although the UDJA\nitself does not waive the State\u2019s sovereign immunity, a declara-\ntory judgment action against a state officer or agent seeking\nrelief from an invalid act or an abuse of authority by an offi-\ncer or agent is not a suit against the State and is therefore not\nbarred by the principles of sovereign immunity. 22 Heist\u2019s peti-\ntion for declaratory relief named, in addition to DCS, Frakes,\nBaum, and Bottorf in their official capacities as respondents,\nand asserted that each was improperly \u201cwithholding the good\ntime implemented by LB 191 . . . by applying LB 191 Good\nTime only to [TRDs] and not to [PEDs].\u201d As such, like the\ndistrict court, we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of\nHeist\u2019s UDJA claim, which he brought as an alternative to his\nAPA claim. However, upon consideration of this claim, we find\nno error by the district court.\n22\n     See, Logan v. Department of Corr.

Two basic principles of statutory interpretation control. 23\nFirst, statutory language is to be given its plain and ordinary\nmeaning, and an appellate court will not resort to interpreta-\ntion to ascertain the meaning of statutory words which are\nplain, direct, and unambiguous. 24 Second, components of a\nseries or collection of statutes pertaining to a certain subject\nmatter are in pari materia and should be conjunctively consid-\nered and construed to determine the intent of the Legislature,\nso that different provisions are consistent, harmonious, and\nsensible. 25\n   [17] Ordinarily, we look no further than the text. 26 In order\nfor a court to inquire into a statute\u2019s legislative history, that\nstatute in question must be open to construction, and a statute\nis open to construction when its terms require interpretation or\nmay reasonably be considered ambiguous. 27\n   Here, like the district court, we find that \u00a7 83-1,107 unam-\nbiguously provides that good time reductions are deducted\nfrom the maximum term. Subsection (2)(c) of \u00a7 83-1,107 spe-\ncifically states:\n      The total reductions under this subsection shall be cred-\n      ited from the date of sentence, which shall include any\n      term of confinement prior to sentence and commitment\n      as provided pursuant to section 83-1,106, and shall be\n      deducted from the maximum term, to determine the date\n      when discharge from the custody of the state becomes\n      mandatory.\n23\n     State v.

Admittedly, subsection (2)(c) does not\nexpressly state that good time shall only be deducted from the\nmaximum term, and subsection (2)(b) uses the word \u201cterm\u201d\u2014\nrather than \u201cmaximum term\u201d\u2014when discussing how L.B. 191\ngood time may be accrued. However, contrary to Heist\u2019s sug-\ngestion, neither factor renders \u00a7 83-1,107 ambiguous.\n   Subsection (2)(c) of \u00a7 83-1,107 plainly states that the total\nreductions shall be deducted from the maximum term. It does\nnot state reductions should be made from the minimum term\nor the mandatory minimum term, which is tantamount to say-\ning that the reductions shall be from only the maximum term.\nMoreover, subsection (2)(c) expressly states that it applies to\nall \u201creductions under this subsection,\u201d including those under\nsubsection (2)(b).\n   [18] The district court buttressed its conclusion regarding\nthe plain meaning of \u00a7 83-1,107 by referencing the statutory\ncanon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, which recog-\nnizes that \u201can expressed object of a statute\u2019s operation excludes\nthe statute\u2019s operation on all other objects unmentioned by\nthe statute.\u201d 28 Specifically, it noted that \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(c)\u2019s\nprovisions for deductions from the maximum term necessarily\nexcludes \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b) from operating on an inmate\u2019s mini-\nmum term and, by extension, PED.\n   Heist maintains that this was erroneous and that the district\ncourt should instead have adopted his interpretation, based\non the canon of in pari materia. He maintains that the district\ncourt\u2019s approach \u201ccreates conflict\u201d between the various provi-\nsions of the Nebraska Treatment and Corrections Act, while his\napproach \u201charmonizes\u201d them. 29\n   The district court considered Heist\u2019s proposed interpreta-\ntion based on in pari materia and properly rejected it. Heist\u2019s\nargument seems to be that because \u00a7 83-1,110(1) states that\n\u201c[e]very committed offender shall be eligible for parole when\n28\n     Pfizer v. Lancaster Cty.

Heist similarly maintains\nthat not counting L.B. 191 good time toward PEDs \u201ccreates\nconflict\u201d between \u00a7\u00a7 83-1,107 and other provisions of the\nNebraska Treatment and Corrections Act, specifically Neb.\nRev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 83-170(7) and 83-1,109 (Cum. Supp. 2020)\nand 83-1,110.\n   [19] Heist\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive. Section 83-170(7)\nmerely defines \u201cgood time\u201d as any reduction of a sentence\ngranted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 83-1,107 and 83-1,108 and makes\nno reference to an inmate\u2019s PED. Section 83-1,109 merely\nrequires DCS to manage information relevant to parole eligi-\nbility, as well as good time credits, but makes no reference to\nhow to calculate an inmate\u2019s PED. 30 Section 83-1,110 specifi-\ncally provides that where a mandatory minimum sentence is\ninvolved, as is the case here, an inmate\u2019s PED is calculated\nby subtracting the mandatory minimum sentence from the\ncourt\u2019s minimum sentence, halving the difference, and add-\ning that difference to the mandatory minimum. 31 Under these\nprovisions, good time reductions taken under \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(b)\nwould not affect an inmate\u2019s PED unless they can be applied\nto an inmate\u2019s minimum or mandatory minimum sentence,\nsomething which is not possible under the plain meaning\nof \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(c), as we have previously discussed. Thus,\nthe language of \u00a7 83-1,107 can be adequately understood\nwhen considered in pari materia with other statutes in the\nNebraska Treatment and Corrections Act. Further, although we\ndo not find any conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 83-1,107 and 83-1,110,\nwe agree with the district court that even if conflict did exist,\nthe specific language of \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(c) would control over\nthe general language of \u00a7 83-1,110. To the extent conflict\n30\n     See, generally, Gray v. Frakes, 311 Neb. 409, 973 N.W.2d 166 (2022).\n31\n     State v.

Stat\n\u00a7 29-2204(6)(a) (Reissue 2016), which requires a court, when\nimposing an indeterminate sentence, to advise the offender of\nthe time the offender will serve on his or her minimum term\nbefore attaining parole eligibility and the time the offender will\nserve on his or her maximum term before attaining mandatory\nrelease, assuming that no good time for which the offender will\nbe eligible is lost. However, Heist\u2019s argument that this statute\n\u201cassume[s] good time is used to calculate parole eligibility\u201d is\nalso unpersuasive. 33 Section 29-2204(6)(a) merely requires a\ncourt to give certain advisements to an offender when imposing\nan indeterminate sentence upon that offender; it neither states\nnor assumes that good time reductions are applicable to an\ninmate\u2019s minimum sentence. Thus, Heist\u2019s assignments of error\nregarding the interpretation of \u00a7 83-1,107 are without merit.\n   Additionally, we acknowledge that Heist urges this court\nto look at the legislative history of L.B. 191 to ascertain the\nLegislature\u2019s intent and that the district court did so. However,\nin order for a court to inquire into a statute\u2019s legislative his-\ntory, that statute in question must be open to construction, and\na statute is open to construction when its terms require inter-\npretation or may reasonably be considered ambiguous. 34 As\ndiscussed above, the language of \u00a7 83-1,107 is not ambiguous\nand therefore not open to construction.

State. 36 In\nAdams, a DCS inmate brought a declaratory judgment action\nagainst the Board of Parole, seeking a determination that\n\u00a7 83-1,110(1) unconstitutionally usurped the board\u2019s authority\nand a declaration that he was eligible for parole. 37 In discuss-\ning \u00a7 83-1,110(1), we stated, \u201cThe Legislature has declared that\n\u2018[e]very committed offender shall be eligible for parole when\nthe offender has served one-half the minimum term of his or\nher sentence . . . ,\u2019 as adjusted for good time.\u201d 38 Heist argues\nthat this language indicates this court\u2019s \u201cclear interpretation\nthat the one-half reduction to the minimum term is for good\ntime.\u201d 39 We disagree.\n   First, the plain language of \u00a7 83-1,110 makes it clear that\nthe phrase \u201cone-half the minimum term\u201d refers to the point at\nwhich an inmate shall be eligible for parole, not to a reduc-\ntion in an inmate\u2019s minimum sentence. Second, to the extent\n\u00a7 83-1,110 references good time reductions, the plain language\nof the statute states that such reductions are not applicable to\na sentence imposing a mandatory minimum term, as is the\ncase here. Third, and most important, our opinion in Adams\ndiscussed \u00a7 83-1,110(1) under the conditions clause of the\nNebraska Constitution.

State 41 and State v. Castillas 42 to conclude that\ngood time reductions are not used to calculate an inmate\u2019s\nPED. We note, however, that the district court only refer-\nenced Castillas and Caton to recite how PEDs and TRDs are\ncalculated in Nebraska. Additionally, though Heist is correct\nthat both cases \u201cdeal with calculating mandatory minimums\n. . . and neither addresses [L.B.] 191 good time,\u201d 43 he fails to\nappreciate that those cases did not discuss L.B. 191 good time,\nbecause the sentences at issue in those cases occurred prior\nto the enactment of L.B. 191. Therefore, L.B. 191 good time\nreductions would not have been available to the petitioners in\nCastillas and Caton, and as such, it was not necessary for us to\ndiscuss such reductions there.\n                  (c) Impact of \u00a7 83-1,107(2)\n   Heist further argues that the district court erred in find-\ning that \u00a7 83-1,107(2) unambiguously provides that L.B. 191\ngood time applies only to reductions in the maximum term,\nbecause this approach results in the \u201canomalous, unusual,\nor absurd result\u201d of 62 inmates currently having inverted\nsentences. 44 In support of his argument, Heist points to our\ndecisions in Castillas and Johnson v. Kenney. 45 In Castillas,\nwe recognized that one of the purposes behind \u00a7 83-1,107\nwas to \u201censure that no one would reach mandatory discharge\nbefore reaching parole eligibility.\u201d 46 Then, in Johnson, we\nexplained that it would not serve the legislative intent if a\n41\n     Caton v.

Since 1995, \u00a7 83-1,107 has\nbeen amended on numerous occasions, but the Legislature\nhas never again referred to good time being applied to reduce\nan inmate\u2019s minimum sentence. Thus, the omission of those\nphrases from the statute appears intentional and not a techni-\ncal or ministerial error; and the absurdity Heist complains of\ncannot be corrected by simply supplying the words \u201cminimum\nsentence\u201d or \u201cparole eligibility date\u201d into the language of\n\u00a7 83-1,107.\n   [22] Further, although L.B. 191 has caused some inmates\nto incur inverted sentences, such result appears to be an unin-\ntended consequence of L.B. 191. The absurd results doctrine\ndoes not include substantive errors arising from a drafter\u2019s\nfailure to appreciate the effect of certain statutory provisions. 56\nThus, conceding that the DCS interpretation of \u00a7 83-1,107(2),\nof which Heist complains, has produced the allegedly absurd\nresult of 62 inmates with inverted sentences, this falls far short\nof meeting the high bar of manifest absurdity.\n   We are not the only court to take this view. In Chung Fook\nv. White, 57 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a provision in the\nImmigration Act of 1917, which exempted wives and children\nof naturalized citizens from mandatory detention upon entering\nthe country if they were found to be affected with a contagious\ndisease, but made no such provisions for wives and children of\nnative-born citizens.

However, the application\nof L.B. 191 has created inverted sentences for some inmates.\nNevertheless, because \u00a7 83-1,107(2)(c) plainly states that good\ntime is to be applied to reduce an inmate\u2019s maximum sen-\ntence, we cannot interpolate the words \u201cminimum sentence\u201d or\n\u201cparole eligibility date\u201d without usurping the legislative func-\ntion.
