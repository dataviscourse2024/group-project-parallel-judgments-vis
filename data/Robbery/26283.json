GORE\nNATURE OF THE CASE:                       CIVIL - POSTCONVICTION RELIEF\nDISPOSITION:                              AFFIRMED - 10/16/2018\nMOTION FOR REHEARING FILED:\nMANDATE ISSUED:\n\n       BEFORE GRIFFIS, P.J., CARLTON AND WESTBROOKS, JJ.\n\n       WESTBROOKS, J., FOR THE COURT:\n\n\u00b61.    Chad Edward Spiers, appearing pro se, appeals the Harrison County Circuit Court\u2019s\n\ndenial of his motion for postconviction relief (PCR). After review of the record, we affirm.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b62.    In August 2015, Spiers pleaded guilty to credit-card fraud under Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated section 97-19-21 (Rev. 2014) and burglary under Mississippi Code Annotated\n\nsection 99-19-81 (Rev. 2015). He was sentenced to three years for credit-card fraud as a\n\nhabitual offender and seven years, with three years suspended, for the burglary conviction.\n\nThe sentences were to run consecutively followed by three years of postrelease supervision.\n\fThe sentencing order also stated that Spiers was to successfully complete a long-term drug\n\nand alcohol therapeutic program while in the custody of the Mississippi Department of\n\nCorrections (MDOC).\n\n\u00b63.    Spiers alleged that because he was in protective custody, he was not given the\n\nopportunity to participate in the long-term drug and alcohol therapeutic program. It appears\n\nthat Spiers filed a grievance with the Administrative Remedy Program, pursuant to\n\nMississippi Code Annotated sections 47-5-801 through 47-5-807 (Rev. 2015), stating that\n\nhe wanted to be removed from protective custody and returned to general population. In\n\nSeptember 2016, the MDOC responded to Spiers\u2019s grievance and informed him that they\n\nwould review his placement back in the drug and alcohol program.\n\n\u00b64.    In May 2017, Spiers filed a PCR motion asking the circuit court to amend or otherwise\n\nchange his sentence to eliminate required completion of the long-term drug and alcohol\n\nprogram. The circuit court denied the motion in October 2017. Spiers timely appeals.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b65.    \u201cWe review the dismissal or denial of a PCR motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d Hughes\n\nv. State, 106 So. 3d 836, 838 (\u00b64) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012). \u201cWe will only reverse if the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s decision is clearly erroneous.\u201d Id. \u201cWhen reviewing questions of law, our standard\n\nis de novo.\u201d Id. \u201cThis court will affirm the summary dismissal of a PCR motion if the\n\nmovant fails to demonstrate a claim procedurally alive substantially showing the denial of\n\na state or federal right.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f\u00b66.    Spiers asserts that the circuit court erred in denying his PCR motion because he cannot\n\nsuccessfully complete the long-term drug and alcohol therapeutic program as \u201cmandated\u201d by\n\nthis sentencing order. Because neither the circuit court nor this Court has statutory authority\n\nto manage programs operated by the MDOC, we find Spiers\u2019s argument is without merit.\n\n\u00b67.    Spiers was sentenced to the long-term drug and alcohol therapeutic program by the\n\ncircuit court; however, the program is run exclusively by the MDOC. See Miss. Code Ann.\n\n\u00a7 47-5-10 (Rev. 2015). \u201cThe courts do not manage MDOC inmates or operate the\n\ndepartment of corrections.\u201d Jefferson v. State, 958 So. 2d 1276, 1287 (\u00b634) (Miss. Ct. App.\n\n2007). Furthermore, this Court has held that \u201cthe commissioner is charged with planning,\n\ndeveloping, and coordinating a statewide comprehensive correctional program designed to\n\ntrain and rehabilitate offenders in order to prevent, control and retard recidivism.\u201d Id. \u201cNot\n\nonly that, the commissioner is vested with the exclusive authority and responsibility for the\n\nmanagement and control of the correctional system and for the proper care, treatment,\n\nfeeding, clothing, and management of the offenders confined therein.\u201d Id.; see also Miss.\n\nCode Ann. \u00a7 47-5-23 (Rev. 2015). Therefore, we find no error in the circuit court\u2019s denial\n\nof Spiers\u2019s PCR motion citing that the courts did not manage MDOC inmates or operate the\n\ndepartment of corrections.\n\n\u00b68.    Spiers also requested that the circuit court allow him to participate in the drug and\n\nalcohol treatment program during postrelease supervision. But, under Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated section 47-5-1003(4) (Rev. 2015), \u201c[t]he courts may not require an offender to\n\nparticipate in the intensive supervision program during a term of probation or post-release\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fsupervision.\u201d See also Jefferson, 958 So. 2d at 1286 (\u00b630).\n\n\u00b69.    Further, we note that there is nothing within Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-\n\n39-1-119 (Rev. 2015) that would allow this Court to address Spiers\u2019s claim. Accordingly,\n\nwe find this includes the long-term drug and alcohol therapeutic program under the exclusive\n\nsupervision of the MDOC and find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Spiers\u2019s PCR\n\nmotion.\n\n\u00b610.
