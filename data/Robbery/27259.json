Criminal Law: Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. When\n                    reviewing a criminal conviction for sufficiency of the evidence to\n                    sustain the conviction, the relevant question for an appellate court is\n                    whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n                    prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential ele-\n                    ments of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                 2. Motions to Dismiss: Directed Verdict: Waiver: Appeal and Error. A\n                    defendant who moves for dismissal or a directed verdict at the close of\n                    the evidence in the State\u2019s case in chief in a criminal prosecution and\n                    who, when the court overrules the dismissal or directed verdict motion,\n                    proceeds with trial and introduces evidence, waives the appellate right\n                    to challenge correctness in the trial court\u2019s overruling the motion for\n                    dismissal or a directed verdict but may still challenge the sufficiency of\n                    the evidence.\n                 3. Criminal Law: Evidence: Appeal and Error. When a criminal defend\u00ad\n                    ant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence upon which a conviction\n                    is based, the relevant question for an appellate court is whether, after\n                    viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n                    rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\n                    beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                 4. Evidence: Waiver: Appeal and Error. A party who fails to make a\n                    timely objection to evidence waives the right on appeal to assert preju-\n                    dicial error concerning the evidence received without objection.\n                 5. Convictions: Presumptions: Right to Counsel: Waiver: Proof.\n                    Convictions obtained after Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.\n                    Ct. 792, 9 L.

VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Sarpy County: Stefanie\nA. Martinez, Judge. Affirmed.\n  Thomas P. Strigenz, Sarpy County Public Defender, and\nMitchell Sell, Senior Certified Law Student, for appellant.\n  Douglas J. Peterson, Attorney General, and Melissa R.\nVincent for appellee.\n  Miller-Lerman, Cassel, Stacy, Funke, Papik, and\nFreudenberg, JJ.\n   Papik, J.\n   Abdul F. Vann appeals his conviction for possession of\na deadly weapon by a prohibited person. Vann argues that\nhis conviction should be overturned because the State did\nnot introduce evidence affirmatively showing that he had or\nwaived counsel at the time of his prior felony conviction.\nWe, however, find that there was sufficient evidence to sup-\nport Vann\u2019s conviction and that the district court did not err\nin admitting into evidence certified court records showing that\nVann had counsel at the time he was sentenced for his prior\nconviction, but was silent as to whether he had counsel at the\ntime he entered his plea. Finding no error, we affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n   This case arises out of an incident in which a law enforce-\nment officer found a set of brass knuckles in Vann\u2019s pocket\nduring a search. This led the State to bring charges against\nVann for possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited person\nand carrying a concealed weapon, among other charges.\n   To prove that Vann was a felon and therefore prohibited\nfrom possessing a deadly weapon, the State offered docu-\nmentary evidence that Vann was convicted of possession of\ncocaine in the district court for Douglas County in 1992. In\nparticular, the State offered exhibit 7, a five-page court record\nauthenticated by the clerk of the district court for Douglas\n\f                              - 93 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nCounty. Exhibit 7 indicated that Vann was charged in that\ncourt with possession of cocaine and that he appeared with\ncounsel for sentencing following a guilty plea. Nothing in\nexhibit 7 expressly indicated that Vann was represented by\ncounsel at the time he entered his guilty plea or that he had\nwaived that right. When the State offered exhibit 7, Vann\u2019s\ncounsel stated, \u201cI have no objection to Exhibit 7 as an authen-\nticated, certified copy.\u201d The district court received exhibit 7\ninto evidence.\n   At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, Vann moved to dis-\nmiss the charge of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohib-\nited person. Vann argued that exhibit 7 did not show that he\nhad or waived counsel at the time of his prior guilty plea and\nwas thus insufficient to establish that Vann was a prohibited\nperson under State v. Portsche, 258 Neb. 926, 606 N.W.2d 794\n(2000). The district court denied Vann\u2019s motion to dismiss.\nVann went on to introduce evidence of his own. After the con-\nclusion of all evidence, Vann renewed his motion to dismiss on\nthe ground that the evidence was insufficient. The district court\noverruled the motion.\n   The jury convicted Vann of both possession of a deadly\nweapon by a prohibited person and possession of a concealed\nweapon. Vann was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1\nyear for possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited person\nand 6 months for possession of a concealed weapon. The sen-\ntences were ordered to be served concurrently to each other\nand with a sentence for a conviction in North Dakota. After\nVann timely appealed, we moved the case to our docket. See\nNeb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-1106(3) (Cum. Supp. 2018).\n                ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Vann assigns that the district court erred by (1) overruling\nhis motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case and\n(2) finding that exhibit 7 was a valid prior conviction that\ncould be used to prove that he had previously been convicted\nof a felony.\n\f                              - 94 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\n                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] When reviewing a criminal conviction for sufficiency of\nthe evidence to sustain the conviction, the relevant question\nfor an appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Stubbendieck, 302 Neb.\n702, 924 N.W.2d 711 (2019).\n\n                           ANALYSIS\n   Vann\u2019s assignments of error pertain only to his conviction\nfor possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited person.\nBoth of his assignments of error challenge the State\u2019s use of\nexhibit 7 to prove that Vann had a prior felony conviction.\nVann argues that because exhibit 7 did not affirmatively show\nthat Vann had or waived counsel at the time of his guilty\nplea in his prior case, his motion to dismiss should have been\ngranted and exhibit 7 should not have been admitted into evi-\ndence. Though Vann\u2019s assignments of error are similar, they\nare analytically distinct and we thus consider them separately\nin the sections below.\n\nSufficiency of Evidence.\n   [2] Vann\u2019s first argument is that the district court erred\nby denying the motion to dismiss he filed at the conclusion\nof the State\u2019s case. The record, however, shows that after\nthe State rested and Vann\u2019s motion was denied, Vann put on\nevidence of his own. Vann thereby waived the right to chal-\nlenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. A\ndefendant who moves for dismissal or a directed verdict at the\nclose of the evidence in the State\u2019s case in chief in a criminal\nprosecution and who, when the court overrules the dismissal\nor directed verdict motion, proceeds with trial and introduces\nevidence, waives the appellate right to challenge correct-\nness in the trial court\u2019s overruling the motion for dismissal\nor a directed verdict but may still challenge the sufficiency\n\f                              - 95 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nof the evidence. State v. Briggs, 303 Neb. 352, 929 N.W.2d\n65 (2019).\n   [3] Vann also asserts that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport his conviction. When a criminal defendant challenges\nthe sufficiency of the evidence upon which a conviction is\nbased, the relevant question for an appellate court is whether,\nafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nState v. Montoya, 304 Neb. 96, 933 N.W.2d 558 (2019). In\norder to review whether there was sufficient evidence to sup-\nport Vann\u2019s conviction for possession of a deadly weapon by a\nprohibited person, we must therefore first determine the essen-\ntial elements of the offense.\n   To determine the elements of a crime, we look to the text\nof the statute. State v. Mann, 302 Neb. 804, 925 N.W.2d 324\n(2019). The statutory definition of possession of a deadly\nweapon by a prohibited person in effect at the time of the\noffense is set forth in Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-1206 (Reissue\n2016). It provides, in pertinent part, that a person commits\nthe offense if he or she \u201cpossesses a firearm, a knife, or brass\nor iron knuckles\u201d and \u201chas previously been convicted of a\nfelony.\u201d The statutory text thus sets forth two elements that the\nState was required to prove in order to convict Vann: (1) that\nhe possessed a firearm, a knife, or brass or iron knuckles and\n(2) that he had a previous felony conviction. See, also, State\nv. Castor, 257 Neb. 572, 599 N.W.2d 201 (1999) (finding that\nprior felony conviction is essential element of offense of felon\nin possession of firearm).\n   Vann does not and could not dispute that there was suf-\nficient evidence of both of the elements listed above\u2014there\nwas evidence that he possessed brass knuckles and that he\nhad a prior felony conviction. Instead, Vann argues that the\nevidence to convict was insufficient because it did not show\nthat he had or waived counsel at the time of his prior convic-\ntion. Vann argues that our opinion in State v. Portsche, 258\n\f                             - 96 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. VANN\n                       Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nNeb. 926, 606 N.W.2d 794 (2000), requires such evidence.\nAs we will explain below, however, Portsche did not recog-\nnize any essential elements beyond those that appear in the\ntext of \u00a7 28-1206, and thus, an argument based on Portsche\nis not properly framed as a challenge to the sufficiency of\nthe evidence.\n   In Portsche, the defendant was charged with being a felon\nin possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 28-1206. At a\nbench trial, the State offered records of a prior plea-based\nconviction, but the district court found that the conviction\nwas not valid for purposes of \u00a7 28-1206 because the records\ndid not reflect that the defendant had an attorney or waived\nhis right to an attorney at the time of his plea. The district\ncourt found the defendant not guilty of the charge, and the\nState brought an error proceeding pursuant to Neb. Rev.\nStat. \u00a7 29-2315.01 (Reissue 1995). In the error proceeding,\nthe State argued that a prior uncounseled conviction could\nestablish that a defendant had \u201cpreviously been convicted of\na felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 28-1206.\n   We rejected the State\u2019s argument in Portsche, citing a\nprior felon in possession case, State v. Groves, 239 Neb. 660,\n477 N.W.2d 789 (1991). In Groves, the defendant argued\nthat the trial court erred by allowing the admission of evi-\ndence that he had a prior burglary conviction. The defendant\nargued that evidence of his prior conviction should have\nbeen excluded because the records failed to show that at\nthe time of his prior conviction, he had or waived counsel.\nWe noted we had previously held in the sentence enhance-\nment context that in order to prove a prior conviction, the\nState was required to prove that, at the time of the convic-\ntion, the defendant had or waived counsel. We determined\nthe State should be required to prove the same in order to\nprove a prior conviction for purposes of \u00a7 28-1206. Notably,\nthe defendant in Groves did not frame his challenge as one\nof insufficient evidence. Instead, he argued that evidence\nof a prior conviction could not be admitted without proof\n\f                              - 97 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nthat the defendant had or waived counsel at the time of the\nprior conviction.\n   We understand Portsche to have adopted a rule pertain-\ning to the admissibility of evidence of prior convictions in\nfelon in possession prosecutions, as opposed to recognizing\nadditional essential elements under \u00a7 28-1206. We reach this\nconclusion for several reasons. First, as we have noted, we\nlook to statutory language to determine the essential elements\nof the offense, and no statutory language makes reference to\nthe role of counsel in a prior conviction. Second, we relied\nupon Groves, which discussed the same rule in the context of\nan evidence admissibility challenge. Third, we summarized\nour holding in admissibility terms: \u201cBefore a prior felony\nconviction can be used to prove that a defendant is a felon\nin a felon in possession case, the State must prove either that\nthe prior felony conviction was counseled or that counsel was\nwaived.\u201d State v. Portsche, 258 Neb. 926, 940, 606 N.W.2d\n794, 803 (2000) (emphasis supplied). And finally, if Portsche\nactually made the presence or waiver of counsel at the time of\na prior conviction an essential element of the offense, juries\ncould be placed in the position of deciding the legal question\nof whether a defendant validly waived counsel.\n   We recognize that in State v. Watt, 285 Neb. 647, 832\nN.W.2d 459 (2013), we briefly considered a sufficiency of the\nevidence argument based on Portsche. To the extent this aspect\nof Watt could be read to suggest that the State is required to\nprove that a defendant charged with violating \u00a7 28-1206 had\nor waived counsel at the time of a prior conviction as an\nessential element of the crime, it is disapproved.\n   For the reasons we have explained, the only essential ele-\nments the State was required to prove to convict Vann were\nthat he possessed brass knuckles and that he was previously\nconvicted of a felony. Because a rational trier of fact could\nhave found both of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt,\nhis sufficiency of the evidence challenge fails.\n\f                               - 98 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                          STATE v. VANN\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nAdmissibility of Exhibit 7.\n   [4] Vann\u2019s other assignment of error is that the district court\nerred by finding that exhibit 7 could be used to prove that he\nhad previously been convicted of a felony. We understand this\nassignment of error to challenge the admissibility of exhibit\n7. At the time exhibit 7 was offered, Vann did not object. We\nhave held that a party who fails to make a timely objection to\nevidence waives the right on appeal to assert prejudicial error\nconcerning the evidence received without objection. See, e.g.,\nState v. Harris, 263 Neb. 331, 640 N.W.2d 24 (2002).\n   At oral argument, Vann argued that the lack of a contempo-\nraneous objection to exhibit 7 does not preclude reversal of his\nconviction in this case because the admission of exhibit 7 was\nplain error. Vann is, of course, correct that we can recognize\nplain error even when evidence is received without a timely\nobjection. See, e.g., State v. Kuhl, 276 Neb. 497, 755 N.W.2d\n389 (2008). As we will explain, however, we do not believe\nthe district court committed any error, let alone plain error, by\nreceiving exhibit 7.\n   In support of his argument that exhibit 7 should not have\nbeen admitted, Vann relies primarily on Portsche. He points\nto language in Portsche stating that where a record is silent\nas to whether a defendant had or waived counsel at the time\nof a prior conviction, courts may not presume that the defend\u00ad\nant had or waived counsel. This language from Portsche is\nconsistent with a line of cases from this court. Particularly\nrelevant to the facts of Vann\u2019s appeal are cases within that\nline of precedent, which hold that, even if there is evidence\na defendant had counsel at the time of sentencing for a prior\nconviction, evidence of that conviction should not be consid-\nered in the absence of proof that the defendant also had or\nwaived counsel at the time of conviction. See, e.g., State v.\nHall, 268 Neb. 91, 679 N.W.2d 760 (2004); State v. Thomas,\n262 Neb. 985, 637 N.W.2d 632 (2002).\n   This line of cases appears to have begun with State v. Smith,\n213 Neb. 446, 329 N.W.2d 564 (1983). In Smith, this court\n\f                              - 99 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nheld that courts could not presume that a defendant\u2019s prior con-\nviction was obtained in compliance with the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel. We did so in reliance on the U.S. Supreme\nCourt\u2019s opinion in Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S. Ct.\n258, 19 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1967).\n   In Burgett, the U.S. Supreme Court held that prosecutors\nin a Texas case could not use records of a prior Tennessee\nconviction when those records did not show that the defend\u00ad\nant had or waived counsel in the Tennessee case. The U.S.\nSupreme Court held that it could not presume the defendant\nhad or waived counsel in the Tennessee proceedings. The\nCourt stated, \u201cTo permit a conviction obtained in violation of\nGideon v. Wainwright[, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed.\n2d 799 (1963),] to be used against a person either to support\nguilt or enhance punishment for another offense . . . is to erode\nthe principle of that case.\u201d Burgett, 389 U.S. at 115.\n   After Smith, we continued to apply the principle we rec-\nognized in reliance on Burgett. See, e.g., State v. Orduna,\n250 Neb. 602, 550 N.W.2d 356 (1996); State v. Ristau, 245\nNeb. 52, 511 N.W.2d 83 (1994); State v. Nowicki, 239 Neb.\n130, 474 N.W.2d 478 (1991). We were not alone among state\nhigh courts in understanding Burgett to prohibit courts from\npresuming that a prior conviction was obtained in compliance\nwith the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g., State v. Grenvik, 291 Or.\n99, 628 P.2d 1195 (1981), overruled, State v. Probst, 339 Or.\n612, 124 P.3d 1237 (2005); State v. Reagan, 103 Ariz. 287, 440\nP.2d 907 (1968), overruled, State v. McCann, 200 Ariz. 27, 21\nP.3d 845 (2001).\n   But while the principle Vann relies upon rests on a particu-\nlar understanding of Burgett, a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court\ndecision indicated that Burgett should not be read so broadly.\nIn Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 113 S. Ct. 517, 121 L. Ed. 2d\n391 (1992), a federal habeas petitioner contended a Kentucky\nsentencing enhancement procedure that presumed the validity\nof prior convictions and required the defendant to show the\nconviction was somehow invalid was unconstitutional.

VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nU.S. Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that the habeas peti-\ntioner was collaterally attacking his prior convictions and that\nunder those circumstances, a \u201c\u2018presumption of regularity\u2019\u201d\nshould attach to the prior convictions. Parke, 506 U.S. at 29.\nIn the course of the opinion, the Court found no merit to an\nargument that Burgett would not permit a presumption that\nthe prior convictions were constitutionally valid. It explained\nthat at the time the prior conviction at issue in Burgett was\nentered, state criminal defendants\u2019 federal constitutional right\nto counsel had not yet been recognized. Under those cir-\ncumstances, the Parke Court said, it was not reasonable to\npresume from a silent record that the prior conviction was\nvalidly obtained.\n   After oral argument in this case, we asked the parties to\nsubmit supplemental briefs addressing whether, in light of\nParke, the State or the defendant bears the burden of proving\nthat a prior conviction was or was not obtained in violation\nof the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Vann argued that\nParke does not call the principle first expressed in Smith into\nquestion. The State argued that Parke rejected the broad read-\ning of Burgett upon which Smith and its progeny relied and\nthat a prior criminal conviction was entitled to a presumption\nof regularity.\n   Having considered Parke and the parties\u2019 arguments regard-\ning it, we do not believe we were correct to say that a court\ncan never presume that a defendant had or waived counsel\nat the time of a prior conviction. Although the line of cases\nbeginning with Smith read Burgett to prohibit such a presump-\ntion as a constitutional matter, Parke makes clear that reading\nof Burgett was too broad and that Burgett does not speak to\nprior convictions obtained after the recognition of a federal\nconstitutional right to counsel in state court in Gideon.\n   Not only do we believe it is not unconstitutional for a court\nto extend a presumption of regularity to post-Gideon prior\nconvictions, we believe such a presumption is consistent with\nthe way our law generally treats final judgments in criminal\n\f                               - 101 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                          STATE v. VANN\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\ncases. We have long held that judgments imposing sentences\nin a criminal case are entitled to a presumption of regular-\nity and validity. See, e.g., Nicholson v. Sigler, 183 Neb. 24,\n157 N.W.2d 872 (1968); Sedlacek v. Hann, 156 Neb. 340, 56\nN.W.2d 138 (1952).\n   Furthermore, as a factual matter, we think it unlikely\nthat many modern convictions are obtained in violation of\na defend\u00adant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. As other courts have\nobserved, the recognition of a constitutional right to counsel\nin Gideon and the further recognition of that right in state stat-\nutes or rules of criminal procedure, see, e.g., Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 29-3903 (Cum. Supp. 2018), make it unlikely that defendants\nare convicted without counsel or waiving the right thereto.\nSee, e.g., Com. v. Saunders, 435 Mass. 691, 761 N.E.2d 490\n(2002); State v. McCann, 200 Ariz. 27, 21 P.3d 845 (2001);\nState v. Glenn, No. 34790-3-II, 2007 WL 2379655 (Wash. App.\nAug. 21, 2007) (unpublished opinion listed at 140 Wash. App.\n1014 (2007)). And even if a conviction is somehow obtained\nin violation of Gideon, a defendant can successfully challenge\nthat conviction. Glenn, supra.\n   We are in no way breaking new ground by concluding that\nBurgett does not prohibit courts from presuming that convic-\ntions obtained after Gideon were obtained in compliance with\nthe Sixth Amendment. After Parke, many state and federal\ncourts have concluded that post-Gideon convictions are enti-\ntled to a presumption of regularity, such that once the govern-\nment establishes the existence of a prior conviction, it becomes\nthe defendant\u2019s burden to prove that he or she did not have\ncounsel and did not waive the right to counsel at the time of\nconviction. See, e.g., U.S. v. Coppage, 772 F.3d 557 (8th Cir.\n2014); U.S. v. Guerrero-Robledo, 565 F.3d 940 (5th Cir. 2009);\nU.S. v. Bush, 405 F.3d 909 (10th Cir. 2005); U.S. v.

We hold that post-Gideon con-\nvictions are entitled to a presumption of regularity such that\nrecords of conviction are admissible unless the defendant can\nshow that he or she did not have or waive counsel at the time\nof conviction.\n   To be clear, our decision leaves untouched the central\nholding of Portsche that the State may not rely upon a con-\nviction obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment in\norder to establish a violation of \u00a7 28-1206. Only the lan-\nguage in Portsche stating that a court cannot presume that a\n\f                              - 103 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nprior conviction was obtained in compliance with the Sixth\nAmendment is disapproved.\n   Additionally, we note that even though this is a case in\nwhich a prior conviction is an element of the offense, our deci-\nsion today also overrules cases in which the State attempted to\nrely on prior convictions to enhance a sentence. As mentioned\nabove, we have previously treated rules governing the con-\nsideration of records of conviction when a prior conviction is\nan element of the offense as equally applicable to attempts to\nuse a prior conviction to enhance a sentence. See, e.g., State\nv. Groves, 239 Neb. 660, 477 N.W.2d 789 (1991). Like other\ncourts, we see no reason to treat the two situations differently\ntoday. See, e.g., Probst, 339 Or. at 624, 124 P.3d at 1244 (col-\nlecting cases in which courts \u201cadopted the presumption of\nregularity for prior convictions used to enhance sentences or\nas elements of a crime\u201d); State v. McCann, 200 Ariz. 27, 21\nP.3d 845 (2001) (holding that presumption of regularity applies\nto prior convictions regardless of whether they are used to\nenhance sentence or to prove element of offense).\n   Turning to the facts of the present case, the application\nof the foregoing principles is straightforward. Via exhibit 7,\nthe State demonstrated the existence of a prior conviction\nobtained decades after the establishment of a federal constitu-\ntional right to counsel, and Vann did not object to its admis-\nsion. At that point, the conviction was entitled to a presump-\ntion of regularity and Vann had the burden to show that he\ndid not have counsel at the time of the conviction and did not\nwaive the right to counsel. Vann, however, introduced no evi-\ndence even suggesting as much. Accordingly, the district court\ndid not err in receiving exhibit 7.\n\nResponse to Concurring Opinion.\n   Prior to concluding, we write in response to the concurring\nopinion\u2019s assertion that, in this opinion, we have adopted \u201cnew\nprinciples of appellate law.\u201d It appears the concurring opin-\nion believes we have done so because of the circumstances\n\f                               - 104 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                          STATE v. VANN\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nunder which we considered the State\u2019s argument that the line\nof cases that began with State v. Smith, 213 Neb. 446, 329\nN.W.2d 564 (1983), rested on a misunderstanding of Burgett v.\nTexas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S. Ct. 258, 19 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1967),\nand should be overruled. As we will explain, however, the\nresult we reach today comes about through the application of\nexisting principles, not the establishment of new ones.\n   First, this opinion does not change our rule that generally\nwe do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.\nAs we recently explained, \u201c[t]his is primarily so because a\ntrial court cannot commit error regarding an issue that was\nnever presented to it or submitted for its disposition.\u201d State v.\nKruse, 303 Neb. 799, 811, 931 N.W.2d 148, 156 (2019). In that\nsame opinion, we said that \u201cwhere the record adequately dem-\nonstrates that the decision of a trial court is correct, although\nsuch correctness is based on a ground or reason different\nfrom that articulated by the trial court, an appellate court will\naffirm.\u201d Id. In the present case, we are not finding that the\ntrial court erred regarding an issue that was not presented to it.\nRather, we are affirming the decision of the trial court on an\nalternate basis, a well-worn path in our jurisprudence.\n   There was also no reason for the State to raise the continu-\ning vitality of the Smith line of cases before the district court.\nNot only was exhibit 7 received into evidence, Vann did not\nobject to its receipt. While we certainly understand that a\nparty generally must make objections to the actions of the trial\ncourt to preserve subsequent appellate review, the admission of\nexhibit 7 was not even a contested issue in the trial court, let\nalone an issue to which the State would be expected to enter\nan objection.\n   Neither do we believe our opinion establishes any new\nprinciples regarding the raising of issues for the first time at\noral argument. We do not dispute that it is generally advis-\nable for parties to raise issues on appeal before oral argu-\nment, but again, we have long recognized that appellate\ncourts may affirm a decision of a trial court where the record\n\f                              - 105 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. VANN\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\ndemonstrates it is correct, even if for a different reason than\nthat expressed by the trial court. Here, the State raised at oral\nargument the continuing vitality of the line of cases beginning\nwith Smith; we gave the parties the opportunity to address the\nissue in supplemental briefing; and ultimately, we determined\nthe trial court decision was correct, albeit for a reason not\nexpressed by the trial court judge.\n   Further, our own precedent indicates that we may con-\nsider this issue on appeal even though the State did not\nraise it in the trial court or until oral argument on appeal.\nIn Bassinger v. Nebraska Heart Hosp., 282 Neb. 835, 806\nN.W.2d 395 (2011), an employee in a workers\u2019 compensation\nmatter argued for the first time on appeal that one of our prior\ncases was wrongly decided. The employer asserted that the\nemployee waived the argument because she did not present\nit to the workers\u2019 compensation review panel. We rejected\nthe employer\u2019s position, explaining that the employee did\nnot waive the argument because the review panel lacked the\npower to overturn our precedent. In this case, the State obvi-\nously could not have asked the trial court to overrule any\nof our cases. And, under the circumstances, neither do we\nbelieve the omission of the issue from the State\u2019s brief on\nappeal can be considered a waiver. The State filed its brief\nbefore we moved the case to our docket, when it was pending\nbefore the Nebraska Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals,\nlike the review panel in Bassinger, lacks the authority to\noverrule our precedent.\n   We also disagree that this opinion makes any changes to our\nplain error review standard. When we review an issue for plain\nerror, we will reverse only when an error is plainly evident\nfrom the record and certain other requirements are met. See,\ne.g., State v. Guzman, 305 Neb. 376, 940 N.W.2d 552 (2020).\nWe applied that standard here, found no plain error, and there-\nfore affirmed.\n   The concurrence does not say how it would resolve this\ncase under plain error review, but to the extent it suggests\n\f                               - 106 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                          STATE v. VANN\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 91\n\nthat we should have found that the receipt of exhibit 7 merely\ndid not rise to the level of plain error without reconsider-\ning any precedent, that course was not open to us here. Our\nprecedent held that it was plain error to presume that a prior\nconviction was obtained in compliance with a defendant\u2019s\nSixth Amendment rights. See, e.g., State v. Thomas, 262 Neb.\n985, 637 N.W.2d 632 (2002). And to the extent the concur-\nrence would have us refuse to reconsider whether something\nwe have held is plain error is actually error at all, that would,\nrather strangely, allow a party to insulate shaky precedent\nfrom review by declining to object at trial. We reviewed\nfor plain error because Vann did not object to the receipt of\nexhibit 7. We do not understand why his failure to object\nwould preclude us from considering whether the precedent he\nrelied upon remains good law.\n                        CONCLUSION\n   Because the district court did not err in receiving exhibit 7\nand because there was sufficient evidence to support the chal-\nlenged conviction under \u00a7 28-1206, we affirm.\n                                                    Affirmed.\n   Heavican, C.J., not participating.\n     Miller-Lerman, J., concurring.\n     Regrettably, today the majority announces a wholly unforced\nnew chapter in Nebraska appellate jurisprudence. The major-\nity opinion establishes the following precedents:\n\u2022\u2009\u2009\u0007The Nebraska Supreme Court will consider new arguments\n   made by any party for the first time at oral argument before\n   the Nebraska Supreme Court (i.e., parties are no longer\n   required to present or preserve a controlling issue earlier in\n   the appellate process or in the lower courts); and\n\u2022\u2009\u2009\u0007\u201cPlain error review\u201d is now a vehicle for the Nebraska\n   Supreme Court for overruling precedent (i.e., the Nebraska\n   Supreme Court\u2019s plain error review doctrine is no longer\n   limited to correcting errors committed by the trial court under\n   existing law plainly evident from the record).\n\f                              - 107 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v.
