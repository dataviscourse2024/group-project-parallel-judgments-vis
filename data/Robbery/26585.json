We affirm.\n\n      Background\n\n      David Brackett, the manager of United Refrigeration, testified that he sells heating,\n\nair-conditioning and refrigeration parts and equipment. One item United Refrigeration\n\nusually sells is refrigerant which is sold in 24 to 110-pound cylinders. The product is\n\ndelivered to United Refrigeration with its name on it and the designation \u201cB-3.\u201d\n\f       On May 12, 2017, Brackett was working at the store comparing the quantity of\n\nrefrigerant in the store against \u201cthe balance sheet.\u201d While doing this, he noticed the shrink\n\nwrap on one pallet of refrigerant \u201cbusted, and one was missing.\u201d\n\n       Brackett suspected that appellant may have been the person who had stolen the\n\nitem. The reason underlying his suspicion involved appellant\u2019s presence in the store the\n\nprevious day for a longer period of time than usual.           This led Brackett to inspect\n\nappellant\u2019s pickup which happened to be outside the store. In the back of the vehicle was\n\nthe missing refrigerant. He knew it was the missing product since it contained the B-3\n\nstore identification number on the box. The coolant he discovered there consisted of a\n\n\u201c50-pound jug of 22 . . . [and] sold . . . for around 955 to $975.\u201d He returned to the store\n\nand questioned appellant. According to Brackett:\n\n              I walked up to him and asked him, I said, \u2018Is that your 50-\n              pound refrigerant in the back of your truck?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes,\n              it is.\u2019 I said, \u2018Where did you get it?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not\n              for sure, because my part-time got it somewhere.\u2019 I informed\n              the -- if I can go on, I informed the man that, well, that jug of\n              refrigerant was our store brand. It\u2019s come out of my\n              warehouse, and had my store number on it, and I was missing\n              one that had been stolen from my warehouse.\n\nAppellant \u201cdidn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Bracket then told appellant he was going to the police\n\nand left to make the call. Appellant left while Brackett was on the phone. Once the police\n\narrived, Brackett gave them a statement regarding the theft. Bracket also checked with\n\nthe other employees and store records and discovered that no customer had purchased\n\nthe particular sized bottle of refrigerant found in appellant\u2019s truck from the store in about\n\na year.\n\n       Later in August of the same year, the police recovered a cylinder of refrigerant after\n\nreceiving a phone call from appellant\u2019s mother who had reported that the stolen property\n\n\n                                              2\n\fwas in her garage. The police took the cylinder to Brackett in order for him to identify it\n\nas his. He was able to recognize it even though it was no longer in the box. First, it was\n\nthe brand of refrigerant that United Refrigeration sold, \u201cNational.\u201d According to Brackett\n\nno one else sold the National brand in Lubbock. Next, the number sequence on the\n\nrefrigerant \u201cwas fairly close sequence of the ones [he] had in stock.\u201d Because some of\n\nthe refrigerant had been used and therefore \u201cnot a full jug,\u201d he would have to check with\n\nthe corporate office on what to do with it, but he would be unable to sell it out of his store.\n\nThe actual code located on the jug and testified to by Brackett was WC 401998. This\n\ncode is placed on there by the bottlers when it\u2019s filled up, according to the witness.\n\nAccordingly, this set of numbers was used by Brackett to identify his property because\n\nthey were close in sequence to the jugs he had in inventory. Finally, Brackett stated that\n\nappellant did not have permission to take the refrigerant. On cross examination, Brackett\n\nadmitted that appellant had been a customer of the store for several years. In regards to\n\nthe serial numbers, he admitted that they are not logged in anywhere and does not have\n\nthe numbers as part of an inventory back-up. Furthermore, if he fails to keep track of his\n\ninventory, he is fined.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s mother testified that she had contacted the police about appellant. In\n\nAugust of 2017, she was moving from her home and found that her son had left some\n\nproperty in her garage. He had placed it there in late summer of 2017. She had asked\n\nhim to remove the property but that he never did. She called the police because she\n\nbelieved the property, a tank of refrigerant, had been stolen. The police determined that\n\nthe property had been stolen and took custody of it. She did not recall telling the police\n\nthat her son had been arrested for the theft.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f        Lloyd Rampy, a City of Lubbock police officer, stated that he had received a call\n\nregarding stolen property on August 14, 2017.                   The caller was appellant\u2019s mother.\n\nAccording to the officer, \u201cshe said that her son, [appellant], was in jail at the time and\n\nbelieved that he was involved in a theft case, and that he had left some property in her\n\ngarage, and she believed that it was stolen.\u201d He recovered the stolen item in the garage\n\nwhich he described as a green refrigerant tank. The officer conferred with the detective\n\nhandling the theft case involving the stolen refrigerant, and confirmed it was a match with\n\nthat which was stolen from Brackett. He, then, contacted the victim and went to his\n\nbusiness where Brackett verified it was his tank.                  Furthermore, the officer went to\n\nBrackett\u2019s warehouse where he was shown similar tanks. The officer was shown \u201cserial\n\nnumbers or [some] identifying marks that were similar to [the] tank that was stolen.\u201d He\n\nrecalled \u201cthe last digits of the numbers of the tanks that he [Brackett] had ended in 199C,\n\nand 200B [and] [t]he numbers on the tank that [he] recovered, the last numbers on it were\n\n199 -- yes, 199.\u201d1 The State, then, rested its case.\n\n        Appellant testified the he knew Brackett and that he had been in United\n\nRefrigeration \u201c[t]housands of times.\u201d He went into the store to buy supplies for his\n\nbusiness and sometimes his employees did. However, he had not been back to the store\n\nafter they had accused him of stealing the refrigerant. According to appellant, he did not\n\nsteal the refrigerant even though it was found in his truck the day following the theft.\n\nAppellant admitted to being in the store on May 11th (the day before the theft was\n\ndiscovered) to wait on one of the employees, Heath Allen, to go to lunch. However,\n\n\n\n        1We   note that earlier in the testimony given by Brackett, he testified that the serial number on the\ntank taken from appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s garage was WC 401998. However, in viewing State\u2019s exhibit 7 of the\nsame tank, the serial number shows to be WC4199B.\n\n                                                      4\n\faccording to appellant, Heath could not go so he left and returned the following day. He\n\nreturned to the store because Heath was \u201cworking on a bid\u201d for some equipment to be\n\nused in a job. When asked why he left when Brackett told him he was calling the police,\n\nappellant thought Brackett was joking, and he had to be in San Angelo which he was\n\nalready two hours late. In regards to the refrigerant being found in his truck, appellant\n\nstated that he had\n\n             hired a guy, his name was Steven Martinez. And he only\n             worked for me for a few days, but I sent him to get a jug of\n             refrigerant the day before, which I had Heath actually do a bid\n             on that too, and a few other things for a job that I had to do.\n             And I was running out of time to get that before -- I had to do\n             it first thing in the morning. So I said, will you go grab that\n             stuff. I gave him the money, and he left and came back. He\n             was going to bring it up on the roof later on at Church\u2019s on\n             82nd and University. I told him to just throw it in the back of\n             the truck, because we didn\u2019t need it on that roof. He took it out\n             of the truck and was going to bring it up on the roof. And I told\n             him, just throw it in the back of the truck. We don\u2019t need it up\n             here. It was for the job in the morning, not that one. The only\n             reason I sent him is because it was like at 4:30, and they close\n             at 5:00. And I needed it for the next morning at 6:30.\n\n      A few months later, appellant was arrested on a theft warrant. This surprised him\n\nbecause he was unaware that he had an active arrest warrant. He answered in the\n\naffirmative to the question of whether he had taken several bottles of refrigerant to his\n\nmother\u2019s garage in the past due to limited space at his place.\n\n      After the defense rested, the State called a rebuttal witness, Heath Allen. Allen\n\nstated that he had worked for United Refrigeration for twelve years. He knew appellant\n\nas a customer of the store for nine years. On May 11, 2017, Allen remembered appellant\n\ncoming into the store \u201caround 1:30, 2:00.\u201d At that time there were a few other customers\n\nin the store along with Allen and another employee who was behind the counter waiting\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fon customers. When appellant came in, appellant allegedly \u201cneeded a cigarette, got one\n\nout of [Allen\u2019s] bag from behind the counter, and went out back to smoke it.\u201d Allen was\n\nnot sure exactly where appellant went when he left from the store. By the time Allen was\n\nfinished with the customer it had been approximately 15 to 20 minutes and he went to\n\nsmoke with appellant. When Allen arrived at the warehouse at the back of the store, he\n\nobserved appellant coming from the second warehouse which he found to be odd since\n\nhe had no business in that warehouse. The second warehouse is where they kept some\n\ntanks of 50-pound R-22 refrigerant on pallets in shrink wrap. Allen did not observe\n\nappellant carrying anything, nor did he write a ticket for appellant for the purchase of a\n\n50-pound container of R-22. According to Allen, the tanks had to be counted every week,\n\nand if appellant or his employee had purchased one the day before there would be a\n\nrecord of it. There was not. Furthermore, he did not know Steve Martinez and had not\n\nsold him the R-22 refrigerant. Allen also said that he had never known appellant to\n\npurchase a 50-pounds. tank of R-22 refrigerant.\n\n      On the day Brackett discovered coolant was missing, Allen thought it was \u201cvery\n\nrare that people even get near those, let alone somebody -- come up missing.\u201d Records\n\nwere checked to make sure it had not been sold and none were found manifesting a sale.\n\nAppellant came back into the store approximately 20 minutes after the discovery of the\n\nmissing tank. According to Allen, Brackett confronted appellant about the coolant being\n\nin the back of his truck. He described the conversation as \u201cintense,\u201d and did not believe\n\nthat Brackett was joking with appellant. Allen stated that appellant responded with \u201cOh,\n\nshit.\u201d \u201cAnd he stood there for a few minutes and then walked out our back door.\u201d He\n\nappeared nervous.\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f       After the close of evidence, the jury found appellant guilty of a Class A\n\nMisdemeanor Theft.\n\n       Issue \u2013 Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       In his sole issue, appellant contends that he could not have appropriated the\n\nalleged stolen property during the time it was alleged to have been stolen. In his view,\n\nhe could not have gone into the warehouse, taken the 50-pound tank out of the\n\nwarehouse without being seen, taken it to his vehicle which was parked in front of the\n\nstore and returned to the warehouse in time for Allen to see him leaving the warehouse.\n\nAppellant also contends that the tank was not recovered with a box bearing the store\u2019s\n\nmark, no witness specified the methodology behind the code numbers on National brand\n\nR\u201322, and no one confirmed the full sequence of each of the tank numbers; thus, a jury\n\ncould not reasonably infer that the combination of letters and numbers on only two tanks\n\nmeant the recovered tank belonged in that lot. He adds that there is little evidence of his\n\nintent to deprive United Refrigeration of its property. Finally, the evidence allegedly does\n\nnot establish, as a matter of law, that appellant appropriated the tank himself, and the\n\nState did not plead that he unlawfully received stolen goods. So, the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support his conviction.\n\n       To evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence an appellate court must view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and ask whether any rational trier\n\nof fact could have found each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nMusacchio v. United States, __U.S. __,__, 136 S. Ct. 709, 715, 193 L. Ed. 2d 639 (2016);\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); Ramsey\n\nv. State, 473 S.W.3d 805, 808 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). Appellate review \u201cdoes not intrude\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fon the jury\u2019s role \u2018to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw\n\nreasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u2019\u201d Musacchio, 136 S. Ct. at 715\n\n(quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319). Additionally, legally sufficient evidence need not\n\nexclude every conceivable alternative to the defendant\u2019s guilt, Ramsey, 473 S.W.3d at\n\n811, and the law requires no particular type of evidence. Direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence are equally probative, and \u201ccircumstantial evidence alone can be sufficient to\n\nestablish guilt.\u201d Johnson v. State, 560 S.W.3d 224, 226 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018) (citing\n\nHooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). While each fact need not\n\npoint directly and independently to the guilt of the accused, the cumulative force of\n\ncircumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to support a conviction. Cordova v. State,\n\n296 S.W.3d 302, 308 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo 2009, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\n       To secure the conviction before us, the State had to prove that appellant unlawfully\n\nappropriated the refrigerant with the intent to deprive the owner of it. TEX. PENAL CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 31.03(a) (West 2019) (stating the elements of theft). An appropriation is unlawful\n\nif, among other things, it is without the owner\u2019s effective consent. Id \u00a7 31.03(b)(1).\n\nFurthermore, to appropriate means, among other things, to acquire or exercise control\n\nover property. Id. \u00a7 31.01(4)(B).\n\n       At bar, the evidence showed that the refrigerant was found missing on May 12th,\n\nthe day after appellant was in the store and seen exiting the warehouse where it was\n\nstored. Also, on the 12th, appellant returned to the store with the missing refrigerant in\n\nthe bed of his truck. The owner identified the product in appellant\u2019s truck as that missing\n\nfrom the store and did so by store identification number, brand of refrigerant, and the\n\nmanner of packaging. When confronted by store personnel, appellant said \u201coh shit,\u201d left\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fthe store, and drove away with the very refrigerant the store owner accused him of\n\nstealing without having paid for it. The item was later found in the garage of appellant\u2019s\n\nmother who said appellant had left it there.\n\n       An accused\u2019s presence at the scene of a crime and flight therefrom are two\n\ncircumstances indicative of guilt, even though they might not alone be sufficient to sustain\n\na conviction. Livingston v. State, 739 S.W.2d 311, 330 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). Here,\n\nappellant left when informed that the police were being called, and he never returned to\n\nthe establishment despite having been a regular customer before the incident.\n\n       Again, each bit of circumstantial evidence by itself need not directly and\n\nindependently prove guilt; the cumulative force of all the circumstances need only\n\nestablish guilt. Beardsley v. State, 738 S.W.2d 681, 685 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987); Ortiz v.\n\nState, 930 S.W.2d 849, 852 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler 1996, no pet.). The cumulative force of\n\nthe evidence here was sufficient to enable a rational fact-finder to conclude, beyond\n\nreasonable doubt, that appellant himself committed theft of the refrigerant.            Our\n\nconclusion relieves us from having to address his remaining arguments.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                        Per Curiam\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f",
