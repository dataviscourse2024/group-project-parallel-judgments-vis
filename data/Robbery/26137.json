The City of Kenosha, Wis-\nconsin, hired Comsys to be its information-technology de-\npartment. Comsys had its offices inside City Hall and stored\nall of its electronic information on the City\u2019s servers. The\n\n\n   *   Of the Southern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.\n\f2                                                 No. 17-2053\n\ncontract between Comsys and the City automatically re-\nnewed from year to year unless terminated, adding that both\nComsys and the City \u201cshall have the right, with or without\ncause, to terminate the Agreement by written notice deliv-\nered to the other party at least twelve (12) calendar months\nprior to the specified effective date of such termination.\u201d The\nCity\u2019s Common Council voted on June 2, 2014, to end the\ncontract, and the City\u2019s Mayor (Keith G. Bosman) delivered\nformal notice two days later. The contract ended on June 5,\n2015.\n    Comsys then sued everyone in sight\u2014the City, the City\u2019s\nWater Utility (for which Comsys also had worked), the\nMayor, the City Administrator (Frank Pacetti), the General\nManager of the Water Utility (Edward St. Peter), the City\u2019s\nDirector of Information Technology (Merril Kerkman, who\nmoved from Comsys to the City on May 1, 2014), and every\nmember of the Common Council who voted to terminate the\ncontract. Comsys asserted that all defendants had violated\nthe First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution (ap-\nplied to these defendants through the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment), and are liable under state con-\ntract and tort law to boot. The district court dismissed sever-\nal claims on the pleadings, 223 F. Supp. 3d 792 (E.D. Wis.\n2016), and later dismissed the Council\u2019s members on the\nground of legislative immunity. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70518\n(E.D. Wis. May 9, 2017). The May 2017 opinion also denied\nmotions for summary judgment on the First and Fourth\nAmendment claims. Mayor Bosman, Administrator Pacetti,\nand Manager St. Peter have appealed from the order to the\nextent it rejected their argument for official immunity. See\nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985).\n\fNo. 17-2053                                                 3\n\n    The record (read favorably to Comsys) shows that after\nKerkman was appointed as Chief Information Officer of\nComsys at the beginning of 2013, Administrator Pacetti be-\ngan to make plans to get rid of Comsys and take the work\nin-house, under Kerkman\u2019s direction. Kathryne McAuliffe,\nComsys\u2019s CEO and sole owner, got wind of this plan, and\nhostilities ensued. Kerkman accessed some of McAuliffe\u2019s\nemails and passed information, which may have included\ntrade secrets and other confidences, to Pacetti. While the Po-\nlice Department was investigating Kerkman on an unrelated\nmatter, McAuliffe told police about his unauthorized access\nof her emails. She later filed a criminal complaint against\nKerkman and Pacetti, and the Sheriff\u2019s Office investigated\nher charges. In May 2014 the Sheriff\u2019s Office confiscated the\nCity\u2019s servers on the authority of a search warrant. That step\ncaused bad feelings as well as considerable difficulty in get-\nting work done. Within days Mayor Bosman asked the\nCommon Council to end the City\u2019s relation with Comsys.\nMcAuliffe wrote to the Common Council, strongly objecting,\nbut the Council sided with the Mayor.\n   Comsys and McAuliffe contend that the contract\u2019s termi-\nnation violated the First Amendment by penalizing three ep-\nisodes of speech. Plaintiffs call this \u201cretaliation,\u201d but that\nword does not add anything to the basic claim that the City\nmade protected speech costly by ending a contract that was\nprofitable to Comsys. See Fairley v. Andrews, 578 F.3d 518,\n525 (7th Cir. 2009).\n   Trying to isolate contract administration from speech\nmay be impossible. Even when a contractor serves at a city\u2019s\npleasure, the deal is unlikely to be called off without some\nreason. Terminations follow breakdowns of relations. Dur-\n\f4                                                  No. 17-2053\n\ning a breakdown, charges and countercharges are likely; it is\nimpossible to imagine the end to a relation such as the one\nbetween Comsys and the City without either side saying\nsomething to the other. Words may be harsh and the ex-\nchanges acrimonious. If that were enough to permit recovery\nunder the Constitution, however, then the federal courts will\nhave displaced state contract law and effectively nullified\nagreements allowing termination without cause.\n    Considerations of this kind led the Supreme Court to\nhold in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), that a public\nemployee cannot use the First Amendment to block (or get\ndamages for) a discharge that follows things the worker said\nas part of the job. As the Court saw matters, the managers in\na public office must be able to maintain discipline and assure\nthat the office functions as elected officials wish. Id. at 422\u2013\n23. The Justices concluded that a public employee is not\nspeaking as a citizen, and therefore is not protected by the\nFirst Amendment, when speaking as part of the job.\n    Neither the Supreme Court nor the Seventh Circuit has\nconsidered whether the same principle applies to the admin-\nistration of public contracts, but every circuit that has ad-\ndressed the issue has given an affirmative answer. See\nDecotiis v. Whittemore, 635 F.3d 22, 26 n.1 (1st Cir. 2011); Ma-\nrez v. Bassett, 595 F.3d 1068, 1074 (9th Cir. 2010); Walden v.\nCenters for Disease Control & Prevention, 669 F.3d 1277, 1285\n(11th Cir. 2012). That conclusion is sound, especially when\nthe contractor is acting as a de facto branch of a public body.\nUntil 2015 Kenosha used a contract, rather than a civil-\nservice system, to provide its information-technology needs.\nIt should have as much freedom to manage that contractual\nrelation as to manage an internal IT department.\n\fNo. 17-2053                                                   5\n\n    Board of County Commissioners v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668\n(1996), and O\u2019Hare Truck Service, Inc. v. Northlake, 518 U.S.\n712 (1996), reinforce this conclusion. Those decisions hold\nthat public contractors are treated just like public employees\nwith respect to the rule against hiring and firing to carry out\npolitical patronage. If contractors and employees are alike in\nthis constitutional respect, why not others? It is hard to see\nhow there could be a difference; after all, the employment re-\nlation is itself a matter of contract under state law, which\nprovides the tenure and conditions of public employment.\n    At least one aspect of the current suit can be resolved on\nthe basis of the Ceballos principle. The day the Common\nCouncil was to vote on terminating the contract, McAuliffe\nsent it a letter accusing Kerkman (by then a City employee)\nand Pacetti of unseemly conduct. The letter\u2019s stated purpose\nwas to provide the Council\u2019s members with \u201cas much in-\nformation as possible [as] they contemplate[d] options with\n[Comsys\u2019s] contracts.\u201d This letter spoke for Comsys as a con-\ntractor trying to keep business. True, the letter was not re-\nquired by the contract, but it dealt with contract administra-\ntion. If Ceballos, after being told that he was in hot water for\nwhat he had written on the job, had penned a letter to his\nmanagers protesting his impending discharge, he could not\nhave used the letter\u2019s lack of success as the fulcrum of a First\nAmendment claim. Allowing that step would make Ceballos\nempty. Our decisions hold that internal memos protesting\ncoworkers\u2019 misconduct are not protected by the First\nAmendment. Forgue v. Chicago, 873 F.3d 962, 966\u201367 (7th Cir.\n2017); Fairley, 578 F.3d at 522. That understanding covers\nMcAuliffe\u2019s letter as well.\n\f6                                                    No. 17-2053\n\n    Two other matters cannot be resolved on the basis of Ce-\nballos. During the initial probe of Kerkman in winter 2014,\nMcAuliffe met with an investigating officer and made state-\nments adverse to him. Then in May 2014 McAuliffe filed a\ncriminal complaint against Kerkman. Both of these steps\nmay have affected the contract but did not occur as part of\nits administration. Statements given under oath at trial or\nbefore a grand jury fall outside the scope of Ceballos, because\nthe \u201cindependent obligation [to tell the truth] renders sworn\ntestimony speech as a citizen and sets it apart from speech\nmade purely in the capacity of an employee.\u201d Lane v. Franks,\n134 S. Ct. 2369, 2379 (2014); see also Chrzanowski v. Bianchi,\n725 F.3d 734, 740 (7th Cir. 2013); Chaklos v. Stevens, 560 F.3d\n705 (7th Cir. 2009); Fairley, 578 F.3d at 524. McAuliffe\u2019s\nstatements were not sworn, but neither were they part of her\ncontractual duties.\n    Still, we recognize that Trigillo v. Snyder, 547 F.3d 826 (7th\nCir. 2008), implies that McAuliffe\u2019s speech falls within the\nscope of Ceballos. Trigillo held that the plaintiff\u2019s reports of\nmisconduct to external government officials, including the\nstate\u2019s attorney general, were part of her employment duties\nand thus were not protected. Id. at 830. It is difficult to dis-\ntinguish McAuliffe\u2019s complaint from the reports of miscon-\nduct in Trigillo. Doubtless the cases are technically distin-\nguishable. McAuliffe reported misconduct at work, while\nTrigillo did that and also asked for guidance on how to ad-\ndress the misconduct; the latter request seems closer in spirit\nto Ceballos. Trigillo was her employer\u2019s manager of pro-\ncurement, and she reported misconduct that affected pro-\ncurement; the connection between Trigillo\u2019s job duties and\nher report thus seems stronger than the connection between\nMcAuliffe\u2019s job duties and her complaint. On the other hand,\n\fNo. 17-2053                                                    7\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s statements seem designed to influence the per-\nformance of the contract, which makes the situation look\nmore like Ceballos.\n    This means that we face a line-drawing problem. The law\ndoes not clearly put McAuliffe\u2019s reports on either the pro-\ntected or the unprotected side. The district judge recognized\nas much, observing several times that it was necessary to\nbalance interests (the City\u2019s interest in having an efficient IT\noperation versus McAuliffe\u2019s interest in protecting her busi-\nness and reporting someone she believed to be a thief of her\nemails) to decide whether the First Amendment overrides\nthe City\u2019s position. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70518 at *23\u201324, 27.\nSee also Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968). To\nsay that the line between protected and unprotected speech\nis so unclear that a judge must engage in after-the-fact bal-\nancing is practically to invite an immunity defense, for only\na violation of clearly established law permits an award of\ndamages. White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548 (2017).\n    It is not enough that the law be established at a high level\nof generality (such as \u201cprotected speech must not be penal-\nized\u201d); doctrine must dictate the resolution of the parties\u2019\ndispute. Kisela v. Hughes, 138 S. Ct. 1148 (2018). It follows\nthat, when case-specific balancing of interests is essential, the\nlaw often is not clear enough to permit awards of damages\nagainst public officials, in the absence of authoritative case\nlaw addressing a comparable situation. See, e.g., Hernandez\nv. O'Malley, 98 F.3d 293, 296 (7th Cir. 1996); Feldman v. Bahn,\n12 F.3d 730, 733\u201334 (7th Cir. 1993); Benson v. Allphin, 786 F.2d\n268, 276 (7th Cir. 1986). See also Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct.\n305 (2015). We appreciate that balancing can lead to only one\noutcome when all factors line up the same way; then im-\n\f8                                                  No. 17-2053\n\nmunity is unavailable. But here the district court found mat-\nters of weight on each side, while plaintiffs rely almost en-\ntirely on highly general principles, such as the rule against\npenalizing protected speech, that do not resolve concrete\ncases presenting questions in gray doctrinal areas.\n    Now we arrive at plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Pacetti violated\nthe Fourth Amendment by asking Kerkman to provide in-\nformation that McAuliffe was storing on the City\u2019s servers.\nKerkman was then the Chief Information Officer of Comsys.\nBy complying with Pacetti\u2019s request Kerkman may have vio-\nlated his fiduciary duty of loyalty to his employer, but that\ndoes not translate to constitutional liability for Pacetti. The\nFourth Amendment applies only to public actors, which\nKerkman was not (yet). See United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S.\n109 (1984) (private searches are not subject to the Fourth\nAmendment).\n    Plaintiffs insist that Pacetti and Kerkman entered into a\nconspiracy, which would make Pacetti liable for what oth-\nerwise would be a private search, but all plaintiffs seem to\nmean by conspiracy is that Pacetti asked Kerkman to act.\nPerhaps the long-term relation between Kerkman and Pacet-\nti, which eventually led to Kerkman\u2019s hiring as the City\u2019s\nhead of information technology, calls for treating Kerkman\nas an official agent; the district judge thought that more fac-\ntual development was essential to decide the merits. 2017\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 70518 at *39. (That conclusion is not before us\non an interlocutory appeal. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304\n(1995).) But for purposes of official immunity, the question is\nwhether existing law clearly establishes that a private search\nis treated as a governmental search when the public and pri-\nvate actors are friends and potential future coworkers.\n\fNo. 17-2053                                                                9\n\n    Plaintiffs do not cite any decision clearly establishing\nsuch a rule; we could not find one on our own. To the con-\ntrary, established law sets up a multifactor balancing ap-\nproach that asks just how entangled the public and private\nactions were. See, e.g., United States v. Crowley, 285 F.3d 553,\n558 (7th Cir. 2002). As we\u2019ve already observed, a claim that\nrelies on multifactor balancing often does not identify a\nclearly established rule. The district court discussed several\nof the applicable factors when explaining why the record is\nnot sufficiently developed to decide whether Kerkman was\nacting as Pacetti\u2019s tool. That list of factors and uncertainties\nis why qualified immunity applies. As the Supreme Court\nput it in White:\n   While this Court\u2019s case law do[es] not require a case directly on\n   point for a right to be clearly established, existing precedent\n   must have placed the statutory or constitutional question be-\n   yond debate. In other words, immunity protects all but the\n   plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law. \u2026\n   As this Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law\n   must be particularized to the facts of the case. Otherwise,\n   [p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immun-\n   ity \u2026 into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleg-\n   ing violation of extremely abstract rights.\n\n137 S. Ct. at 551\u201352 (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). By emphasizing the complexity of determining\neven in hindsight whether Kerkman was acting on his own\nor as Pacetti\u2019s agent, the district court showed that clearly\nestablished law has not \u201cplaced the statutory or constitution-\nal question beyond debate.\u201d\n    The same can be said about the appellants\u2019 second theme:\nthat Kerkman found the information on the City\u2019s own serv-\ners. Public employers can inspect their employees\u2019 email\nwhen that step is reasonable, see Ontario v. Quon, 560 U.S.\n\f10                                                No. 17-2053\n\n746 (2010), with consent, or when the employee lacks an ex-\npectation of privacy. The City did not act with Comsys\u2019s\nconsent. But neither did the contract between Comsys and\nthe City assert a privacy interest.\n    The contract did not regulate the City\u2019s access to data\nthat Comsys chose to store on the City\u2019s equipment. Nor did\nit require Comsys to use the City\u2019s servers for storage. Un-\nlike public employees, who must use their employer\u2019s email\nsystem (which is a big reason for requiring reasonableness or\nconsent), Comsys and McAuliffe were free to protect their\nprivacy by using Gmail, Yahoo!, or any of a hundred other\nsuppliers of encrypted email services.\n    As an IT specialist, Comsys surely knew that it could ac-\nquire its own domain name and set up an email server on its\nown equipment, for the greatest possible security. Instead it\nchose to use the City\u2019s servers, without any contractual\nguarantee of privacy. This puts it in a middle ground: it did\nnot consent to the search (expressly or by implication), but\nneither did it arrange privacy by contract. Clearly estab-\nlished law does not tell us what expectation of privacy a con-\ntractor has in such a situation, which means that the appel-\nlants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n    Qualified immunity protects public employees who do\nnot violate clearly established law. Unless we accept highly\ngeneral statements\u2014such as \u201cdo not invade reasonable ex-\npectations of privacy without probable cause\u201d\u2014as clearly\nestablishing the law when the existence of a reasonable pri-\nvacy interest is itself debatable, these appellants prevail. We\nhave been told by the highest authority not to take general\nprinciples as clearly establishing how novel situations must\nbe resolved. It follows that Mayor Bosman, Administrator\n\fNo. 17-2053                                              11\n\nPacetti, and Manager St. Peter cannot be ordered to pay\ndamages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983. Whether they face liability\nunder Wisconsin law is a question that we do not address.\n     To the extent contested on appeal, the district court\u2019s\ndecision is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings concerning other claims and other litigants.\n\f12                                                No. 17-2053\n\n\n    GILBERT, District Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part. I join with my colleagues on the Fourth Amendment\nquestion. The majority\u2019s holding on the First Amendment\nissue, however, is problematic.\n    Kathryne McAuliffe owns and runs Comsys: a privately-\nheld company. And the record in this case thus far\u2014which\nwe must read favorably to Comsys\u2014is disturbing. First, city\nadministrator Frank Pacetti directed Comsys employee Mer-\nril Kerkman to steal information from Comsys and funnel it\nback to the city so that Pacetti could create a new internal IT\ndepartment. Pacetti would then reward Kerkman for his\ndeeds by making him the new Director of IT for the city.\nMcAuliffe learned of this scheme when she found a confi-\ndential email printed out from her personal archives sitting\non Kerkman\u2019s desk. So, like any rational citizen who realizes\nthat they are a victim of a crime, McAuliffe notified the po-\nlice. The majority recognizes the gravity of the crime, con-\nsidering the opinion acknowledges that the stolen infor-\nmation may have included trade secrets and other confi-\ndences.\n    But the majority does not describe the details of what\nhappened next. The city police department began an admin-\nistrative investigation, and Pacetti\u2019s anger consumed him.\nNot only did Pacetti meet with the police to express his dis-\napproval with the investigation, but he also summoned\nMcAuliffe to his office, screamed at her, and banged his fist\non the desk, threatening \u201cwholesale changes\u201d to the IT de-\npartment\u2014simply because McAuliffe reported a crime\nagainst her privately-held business. This left McAuliffe in\ntears. And after McAuliffe left Pacetti\u2019s office, she learned\n\fNo. 17-2053                                                 13\n\nthat Pacetti had asked for copies of the Comsys contract and\nsaid it \u201cneeded to be re-examined.\u201d\n    Pacetti\u2019s rampage does not stop there. He called another\nmeeting with the police and demanded that they give him\nadvance notice of any arrest of Kerkman, and when the po-\nlice declined, Pacetti stormed out and started another fiery\nconfrontation with McAuliffe\u2014in which Pacetti threatened\nto terminate the Comsys contract if Kerkman got in trouble\nwith law enforcement. Kerkman did get in trouble: when\nthe police investigation revealed that Kerkman likely com-\nmitted computer crimes, McAuliffe filed a criminal com-\nplaint with the county sheriff\u2019s department. McAuliffe also\nmet with a detective in the sheriff\u2019s department to inform\nhim of Pacetti\u2019s threats against her. The majority does not\naddress most of these facts, and even paints McAuliffe\u2014a\ncrime victim\u2014as a villain of-sorts, by stating that law en-\nforcement\u2019s seizure of the city\u2019s servers \u201ccaused bad feelings\nas well as considerable difficulty in getting work done.\u201d\n\n    The majority then holds that Pacetti gets qualified im-\nmunity for his actions because he did not violate any clearly\nestablished rights of the appellees. What the majority is ef-\nfectively saying is that you do not have a clearly established\nright to report a crime against you or your privately-held\nbusiness to the police. That cannot be correct. The First\nAmendment expressly protects \u201cthe right of the people \u2026 to\npetition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d U.S.\nConst. amend. I. This clause has been incorporated against\nthe states through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process\nclause. Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct.\n680, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963). And this circuit has interpreted the\nclause to mean that you have \u201ca right to petition the appro-\n\f14                                                   No. 17-2053\n\npriate government entity [with your grievance] \u2026 .\u201d Hilton\nv. City of Wheeling, 209 F.3d 1005, 1007 (7th Cir. 2000). That\nright \u201c[is] among the most precious of the liberties safe-\nguarded by the Bill of Rights.\u201d United Mine Workers of Am.,\nDist. 12 v. Illinois State Bar Ass'n, 389 U.S. 217, 222 (1967).\n    It should be clear that the First Amendment protects your\nability to report to the police that you are the victim of a\ncrime. And although the Supreme Court \u201cdoes not require a\ncase directly on point for a right to be clearly established,\u201d\nKisela v. Hughes, 138 S. Ct. 1148, 1152 (2018), there are nu-\nmerous published opinions at both the district and circuit\ncourt levels coming to the same conclusion: \u201c[t]he reporting\nof a crime to police officers \u2018constitutes an exercise of the\nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for the\nredress of grievances,\u2019\u201d Ibarra v. City of Chicago, 816 F. Supp.\n2d 541, 550 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (quoting Meyer v. Bd. of Cnty.\nComm'rs of Harper Cnty., 482 F.3d 1232, 1243 (10th Cir. 2007),\nand it is \u201caxiomatic that filing a criminal complaint with law\nenforcement officials constitutes an exercise of [that right].\u201d\nEstate of Morris ex rel. Morris v. Dapolito, 297 F. Supp. 2d 680,\n692 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (citing Gagliardi v. Vill. of Pawling, 18 F.3d\n188, 194\u201395 (2d Cir. 1994); Lott v. Andrews Ctr., 259 F.Supp.2d\n564, 568, 570\u201371 (E.D.Tex. 2003)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n    There is one final matter: the majority is correct that the\nSupreme Court continues to move the ball on when law is\n\u201cclearly established\u201d for a qualified immunity analysis, but\nthe majority takes this principle too far. My colleagues rely\nchiefly on Trigillo v. Snyder, 547 F.3d 826 (7th Cir. 2008) to\nindicate that the right to report a crime against you or your\npersonally-held business is not clearly established at the\n\fNo. 17-2053                                                   15\n\nmoment. But Trigillo dealt with a public service administra-\ntor trying to ensure that the Illinois Department of Correc-\ntions was proceeding appropriately, and when the employee\nbecame more concerned with what was going on at the De-\npartment, she filed a report with the Illinois Attorney Gen-\neral. 547 F.3d 826\u201328. The employee wrote the report on a\ndepartment letterhead and signed it as the \u201cChief of Pro-\ncurement.\u201d Id. at 828. So it should not be a surprise that the\nspeech in Trigillo fell within the scope of Garcetti v. Ceballos,\n547 U.S. 410 (2006), considering the speaker was undoubted-\nly speaking as an employee rather than as a citizen in her\nprivate capacity. That is far different from our case, where\nMcAuliffe learned that someone was stealing trade secrets\nfrom her privately-held business and reported as much to\nthe authorities. And the fact that McAuliffe\u2019s privately-held\nbusiness had a contract with the city cannot mean that sud-\ndenly McAuliffe loses her right to report those computer\ncrimes simply because \u201cperformance of the contract\u201d may be\nat play.\n    Because it is clearly established that McAuliffe had a First\nAmendment right to report a crime against herself and her\nprivately-held business to law enforcement, and Pacetti re-\ntaliated against her for doing so, Pacetti should not be enti-\ntled to qualified immunity on that claim. I respectfully dis-\nsent as to the majority\u2019s holding on the First Amendment\nquestion.\n\f",
