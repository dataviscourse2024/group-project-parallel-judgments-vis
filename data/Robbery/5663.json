            "opinion_text": "\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nVAN SICKLE, Senior District Judge.\nGerald D. Biby was convicted in state court of two counts of theft by deception. Biby petitions for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and moves to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Biby\u2019s application is sufficient to permit him to file the petition for writ of habeas corpus in forma pauperis.\nBiby was the managing partner in a real estate development partnership. Several months after the property had been foreclosed upon and sold at a sheriff\u2019s sale, Biby sent letters to two of the partners asking for their share of the annual installment on the property. State v. Biby, 366 N.W.2d 460, 461-62 (N.D.1985). Unaware of the foreclosure and sheriff\u2019s sale, the two partners sent Biby their payments. Id. at 462. Biby was charged with two counts of theft of property with respect to the receipt of these payments. Id. Biby\u2019s defense was that, with the two partners\u2019 consent, he used the money to pay partnership expenses. Id. Biby was convicted on both counts.\nIn his petition, Biby alleges five grounds for relief: 1) the criminal complaint and summons were issued without probable cause and the charges should\u2019ve been dismissed; 2) the trial court erred in refusing to permit a witness called by the defense to testify; 3) the trial court violated the due process, equal protection, and assistance of counsel provisions of the Constitution by refusing to give two requested jury instructions on the nature of partnerships and liabilities of partners; 4) the trial court violated the due process, equal protection, and assistance of counsel provisions of the Constitution by refusing to give a jury instruction on actual or constructive notice of foreclosure; and 5) the trial court erred in refusing to permit the use of demonstrative evidence.\nRule 4 of the rules governing section 2254 cases states that a court may summarily dismiss a habeas corpus petition \u201c[i]f it plainly appears from the face of the *1566petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. Foil. \u00a7 2254 (1976). An examination of the petition indicates that it presents two issues concerning petitioner\u2019s entitlement to relief in this court: first, whether petitioner has exhausted available state remedies; and second, whether the petition raises claims cognizable in federal habeas corpus proceedings.\nI. EXHAUSTION OF STATE REMEDIES\nThe first inquiry is whether petitioner has exhausted state remedies as to the claims raised. A section 2254 petitioner must exhaust available state remedies before he is entitled to relief in federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c); Duck-worth v. Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 3, 102 S.Ct. 18, 19, 70 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981); White v. Wyrick, 651 F.2d 597, 598 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1058, 102 S.Ct. 608, 70 L.Ed. 596 (1981). The exhaustion requirement is satisfied when a federal habeas petitioner either has fairly presented the substance of his federal claims to the state courts or has no other presently available state remedies to pursue. Graham v. Solem, 728 F.2d 1533, 1535 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 148, 83 L.Ed.2d 86 (1984). The exhaustion requirement restrains the federal courts from upsetting a state court conviction without first giving the state courts the opportunity to correct a constitutional violation. Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1203, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). The purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to \u201cprotect the state courts\u2019 role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent the disruption of state judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. In order to determine whether petitioner has exhausted state remedies the court must first ascertain whether petitioner presented on direct appeal to the North Dakota Supreme Court the substance of the claims he raises in this habeas corpus petition.\nPetitioner previously filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with this court. In the first petition, Biby raised the same claims as he now raises, as well as a Miranda claim. This court dismissed the first petition for failure to exhaust state remedies because Biby had not raised a Miranda claim on appeal before the North Dakota Supreme Court. Biby v. State of North Dakota, No. A1-85-160 (D.N.D. June 17, 1985) (order granting permission to proceed in forma pauperis and dismissing habeas corpus petition). With respect to the petition\u2019s other claims, this court stated that petitioner raised the \u201cidentical issues already submitted to the North Dakota Supreme Court on direct appeal.\u201d Id. Upon further research and more careful consideration of the issues presented to the state supreme court, however, the court concludes that petitioner did not present the constitutional issues to the state court.1\nOn direct appeal to the North Dakota Supreme Court, petitioner raised the same claims he presents in this habeas petition but did not frame most of the claims as violations of his constitutional rights. See Brief for Appellant, State v. Biby, 366 N.W.2d 460 (N.D.1985). In his appeal to the state supreme court petitioner directly raised a constitutional claim only as to the issuance of the criminal complaint (the first claim in the present petition). As to the four other claims raised in this petition, however, Biby did not argue to the state court that these alleged errors amounted to constitutional violations.\nThe exhaustion requirement is not satisfied merely because all the facts necessary to support the federal claim were before the state courts. Anderson v. Harless, 459 U.S. 4, 6, 103 S.Ct. 276, 277, 74 L.Ed.2d 3 (1982); Snethen v. Nix, 736 F.2d 1241, 1244 (8th Cir.1984). The exhaustion requirement is satisfied only when the habeas petitioner \u201c \u2018fairly presented\u2019 to the state courts the \u2018substance\u2019 of his federal corpus claim,\u201d Anderson, 459 U.S. at *15676, 103 S.Ct. at 277, and provided the state courts with a \u201c \u2018fair opportunity\u2019 to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon his constitutional claim,\u201d id.\nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the \u201cfair presentation\u201d and \u201cfair opportunity\u201d tests are met if the petitioner cited the federal Constitution, a federal case, or referred to a specific constitutional right. Purnell v. Missouri Department of Corrections, 753 F.2d 703, 706 (8th Cir. 1985). The Eighth Circuit has also indicated that the tests may be met without specific constitutional references if the underlying facts necessarily implicate a specific right protected by the Constitution or the argument is well within the mainstream of constitutional litigation. Diamond v. Wyrick, 757 F.2d 192, 193 (8th Cir.1985).\nA review of the brief submitted by petitioner to the North Dakota Supreme Court and the cases cited therein reveals that the petitioner did not cite to the federal Constitution, federal cases, or refer to specific constitutional rights with respect to the four claims concerning evidentiary rulings and jury instructions. See Brief for Appellant, State v. Biby, 366 N.W.2d 460 (N.D.1985). Also, the cases cited in petitioner\u2019s brief did not address federal constitutional issues relating to petitioner\u2019s claims. See id. and cases cited therein. Furthermore, the factual allegations presented to the state court were insufficient to put the court on notice of claimed constitutional violations. See Purnell, 753 F.2d at 708 (allegations that the trial court erroneously applied evidentiary principles to admit objectionable hearsay and reject expert testimony are not within the mainstream of constitutional litigation and did not call to mind specific constitutional rights); Davis v. Campbell, 608 F.2d 317, 319 (8th Cir.1979) (admissibility of evidence and improper jury instructions generally do not involve federal constitutional issues). Although petitioner\u2019s brief to the North Dakota Supreme Court contained a few vague references to \u201cfair trial\u201d principles, see Brief for Appellant, supra, these references standing alone, without citation to a provision of the federal Constitution or to federal cases, were not a sufficient presentation of a federal constitutional issue. See Thomas v. Wyrick, 622 F.2d 411, 413 (8th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1175, 103 S.Ct. 824, 74 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1983) (reference to denial of a fair trial, without citation to any provision of the Federal Constitution or to any federal case, was not a sufficient presentation of the federal constitutional issue). Petitioner did not, therefore, fairly present to the state court the substance of four of the five habeas corpus claims.\nFinally, a post-conviction remedy is available to petitioner whereby he can collaterally attack his conviction based upon alleged federal constitutional violations. \u2022 See N.D.Cent.Code \u00a7 29-32-01 (1974). Therefore, petitioner has not exhausted available state remedies with respect to four of the five claims raised in his habeas corpus petition.\nIf a petition contains both exhausted and unexhausted claims, the district court must dismiss the habeas corpus petition. Rose, 455 U.S. at 522, 102 S.Ct. at 1205; Snethen, 736 F.2d at 1244. Biby\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies.\nII. CLAIMS\nA federal court has jurisdiction pursuant to section 2254 only as to complaints relating to federal constitutional rights. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (1976); Graham v. Solem, 728 F.2d 1533, 1535 n. 3 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 148, 83 L.Ed.2d 86 (1984) (only errors of constitutional significance are cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding to review a state conviction). The second inquiry, then, is whether the claims raised by petitioner present federal constitutional issues.\nPetitioner\u2019s first claim, that the criminal charges should have been dismissed because the complaint and summons were issued without probable cause, does not present a cognizable federal claim. It is a well-established rule that a conviction will not be vitiated because the defendant was unlawfully brought before the court. See United States v. Crews, 445 U.S. 463, 474, 100 S.Ct. 1244, 1251, 63 *1568L.Ed.2d 537 (1980) (an illegal arrest, without more, is neither a bar to subsequent prosecution nor a defense to a valid conviction); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 119, 95 S.Ct. 854, 865-66, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975) (it is an established rule that illegal arrest does not void a subsequent conviction); Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S.Ct. 509, 511-12, 96 L.Ed. 541 (1952) (\u201c[t]here is nothing in the Constitution that requires a court to permit a guilty person rightfully convicted to escape justice because he was brought to trial against his will\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s first claim does not present a genuine constitutional issue and is without merit.\nPetitioner\u2019s second claim is that by not permitting a witness to testify the trial court deprived him of effective assistance of counsel and the right to confront witnesses. Generally, a claim that a trial court erred in excluding testimony offered is not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. Davis v. Campbell, 608 F.2d 317, 319 (8th Cir.1979). The admissibility of evidence presents a justiciable federal issue \u201conly where trial errors infringe upon a specific constitution protection or are so prejudicial as to amount to a denial of due process.\u201d Id.\nThe right to counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment involves two entitlements: first, the accused has a right to be represented by counsel in the criminal proceedings; and second, the accused has a right to the effective assistance of counsel. United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2043, 2044, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). The habeas petition neither alleges nor do the facts indicate that Biby was denied legal representation at any stage of the criminal proceedings or that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and prejudiced petitioner. Therefore, petitioner\u2019s claim that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because a witness was not allowed to testify fails to state a cognizable federal claim.\nIn addition to the right to assistance of counsel, the sixth amendment also provides the accused with the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S.Const.Amend. VI. The purpose of the confrontation clause is to ensure that the accused has an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him. Douglas v. State of Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965); Pointer v. State of Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1067-68, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). Petitioner has not alleged facts that indicate he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine any of the prosecution witnesses. Thus, petitioner has not presented a claim cognizable under the confrontation clause.\nPro se pleadings are to be liberally construed, White v. Wyrick, 530 F.2d 818, 819 (8th Cir.1976), but even if the court construes the second claim as alleging a due process violation, it still fails to present a cognizable federal claim. In order to establish a denial of due process petitioner must show that the asserted error was so \u201cgross\u201d or \u201cconspicuously prejudicial\u201d that it \u201cfatally infected the trial and failed to afford petitioner the fundamental fairness which is the essence of due process.\u201d Maggitt v. Wyrick, 533 F.2d 383, 385 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 898, 97 S.Ct. 264, 50 L.Ed.2d 183 (1976). Whether or not the trial court was correct in refusing to admit the witness\u2019 testimony, that refusal did not deprive petitioner of a fair trial. The testimony of the witness was offered to impeach one of the partners, who testified for the prosecution, and to clarify what entity or individual was in fact the partner. Petitioner had the opportunity to accomplish these objectives through cross-examination of the partner. Therefore, the court\u2019s refusal to grant him another avenue for presenting this evidence was not so egregious or fundamentally unfair that it amounts to a denial of due process. Petitioner\u2019s second claim, even if liberally construed, fails to present a justiciable federal issue.\nThe fifth claim is similar to the second claim asserted by petitioner: he alleges that the court\u2019s refusal to admit demonstrative evidence in the form in which it was offered deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. Because this allega*1569tion does not present facts which would constitute a valid assistance of counsel claim, see supra p. 1568, it is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding. Furthermore, even if construed liberally, the claim does not present a valid due process claim. If the court erred in admitting the exhibit in a piecemeal fashion, this error was not so egregious and fundamentally unfair that it rises to the level of a due process violation. Petitioner\u2019s claim concerning the admissibility of demonstrative evidence is not justiciable in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.\nIn his third and fourth claims, petitioner alleges that the trial court erred in failing to give jury instructions on the nature of partnerships, liabilities of partners, and actual or constructive notice of foreclosure. Petitioner alleges that the trial court thereby violated the due process, equal protection, and assistance of counsel clauses of the Constitution. \u201cA state trial court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction does not alone raise a ground cognizable in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d Tyler v. Wyrick, 635 F.2d 752, 753 (8th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 942, 101 S.Ct. 3089, 69 L.Ed.2d 958 (1981); Davis v. Campbell, 608 F.2d 317, 319 (8th Cir.1979). The refusal to give instructions provides a basis for federal habeas corpus relief only when the refusal was so fundamentally unfair and infected the entire trial that the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the due process clause. Tyler, 635 F.2d at 753.\nPetitioner apparently requested the nature of partnership and liabilities of partners instructions in support of his defense that, with the partners\u2019 consent, he used the money to pay partnership expenses incurred in marketing the property. This court agrees with the assessment of the state courts that the proposed instruction was inapplicable to the case. Whether the partners gave petitioner the money to pay for partnership expenses and whether he used the money for that purpose was relevant but whether the partners were legally liable for partnership expenses was not relevant to petitioner\u2019s defense. The failure of the trial court to instruct the jury on the nature of partnerships and the liability of partners, therefore, was not so fundamentally unfair and egregious as to constitute a due process violation.\nSimilarly, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on actual or constructive notice of foreclosure does not violate the due process clause. Petitioner apparently offered the notice of foreclosure instruction to bolster a claim that the doctors were not defrauded because they should have known of the foreclosure. Under North Dakota law, however, a claim that the defrauded party should have known of or easily could have discovered the falsity of the representation is not a defense to a charge of theft by deception. State v. Hastings, 77 N.D. 146, 153, 41 N.W.2d 305, 309 (1950) (the fact that investigation and the exercise of ordinary prudence would have disclosed the falsity of the pretenses is not important; what is important is whether the false pretenses in fact deceived the person defrauded); State v. Stewart, 9 N.D. 409, 414-16, 83 N.W. 869, 870-71 (1900) (it is no defense to the crime that the victim was negligent or lacked prudence in failing to discover the falsehood). The notice of foreclosure instruction, then, did not relate to a valid defense and was correctly denied. The court concludes that the failure of the trial court to give the requested jury instructions did not violate the due process clause.\nPetitioner has also alleged that the failure to give the requested jury instructions constitutes a violation of the equal protection and assistance of counsel clause of the Constitution. The equal protection clause guarantees that all persons who are similarly situated will be treated alike, absent a justification for treating them differently. Brown v. Jensen, 572 F.Supp. 193, 199 (D.Colo.1983). Petitioner\u2019s claims do not present facts that would support an equal protection claim. Plaintiff has also failed to present an effective assistance of counsel claim, see supra, p. 1568. The court concludes that the claimed errors of the trial court relating to jury instructions do not have federal constitutional dimensions and are not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.\n*1570In summary, the court concludes that Biby\u2019s petition should be dismissed because the claims presented in the petition are without merit from the standpoint of stating federal constitutional grounds. The court also concludes that the petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies.\nAlthough the court could merely dismiss the petition for failure to exhaust state remedies, the court is also dismissing the petition on the alternative ground of failure to present valid federal constitutional claims. The court is dismissing the petition on both grounds because the purposes of the exhaustion requirement will not be furthered by referring to the state courts claims that are without merit. See Purnell v. Missouri Department of Corrections, 753 F.2d 703, 711 (8th Cir.1985) (Bright, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Veneri v. State of Missouri, 734 F.2d 391, 393 (8th Cir.1984).\nIT IS ORDERED:\nPetitioner\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The clerk shall file the action without prepayment of fees and costs.\nThe above-entitled action is dismissed with prejudice.\n\n. The North Dakota Supreme Court\u2019s record has not been submitted as a part of the record in this action but this court has examined the briefs submitted to the supreme court on direct appeal of petitioner's conviction.\n\n",
