Exercising\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), we initially denied Mr. Wilfong\u2019s\n\napplication for a certificate of appealability (COA) and dismissed the matter. After\n\npanel rehearing, however, we granted a partial COA and ordered additional briefing.\n\nWe now affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Wilfong\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.\n\n\n      *\n        After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of\nthis appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral\nestoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with\nFed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                    BACKGROUND\n\n         On September 6, 2011, a federal grand jury charged Mr. Wilfong in a one-\n\ncount superseding indictment with possession of a firearm after a felony conviction\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On September 19, 2011, a jury found Mr.\n\nWilfong guilty of that charge.\n\n         Before sentencing, the United States notified Mr. Wilfong that it intended to\n\nseek a sentencing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Under the ACCA, a felon with three or more prior convictions for a\n\n\u201cserious drug offense\u201d or a \u201cviolent felony\u201d must receive a sentence of at least 15\n\nyears\u2019 imprisonment. Id. A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a crime that is punishable by more\n\nthan one year in prison and (1) \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or\n\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d (the elements clause);\n\n(2) \u201cis burglary, arson, . . . extortion, [or] involves use of explosives\u201d (the\n\nenumerated-offenses clause); or (3) \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d (the residual clause). Id.\n\n\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).\n\n         The United States Probation Office also determined that Mr. Wilfong qualified\n\nfor the enhancement based on a federal conviction for use of a telephone to make a\n\nthreat as to an explosive device, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e); a state conviction\n\nfor larceny from a person, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1708; and two state\n\nconvictions for assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21,\n\n\u00a7 645.\n\n                                             2\n\f       Mr. Wilfong objected to the ACCA enhancement, contending that neither his\n\nfederal conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e) nor his state larceny conviction under\n\nOkla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1708 qualifies as a predicate violent felony under the ACCA.\n\nThe sentencing court disagreed and concluded that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s federal conviction\n\nwas a violent felony under the elements clause, and that his state larceny conviction\n\nwas a violent felony under the residual clause. In determining Mr. Wilfong\u2019s federal\n\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e) was a violent felony under the elements clause,\n\nthe sentencing court seemingly relied on the underlying facts in the presentence\n\nreport to define the elements of his conviction. The court then sentenced Mr. Wilfong\n\nto 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release.\n\n       A panel of this court upheld Mr. Wilfong\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct\n\nappeal. United States v. Wilfong, 528 F. App\u2019x 814 (10th Cir. 2013) (unpublished).\n\nDuring that appeal, Mr. Wilfong conceded that his two convictions for assault with a\n\ndangerous weapon were violent felonies under the ACCA. Id. at 820. And we held\n\nthat Mr. Wilfong\u2019s larceny conviction qualified as a predicate offense under the\n\nresidual clause. Id. at 820\u201321. Because only three predicate offenses were needed to\n\nuphold Mr. Wilfong\u2019s enhanced sentence, we did not address whether his federal\n\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e) qualified as a violent felony under the Act. The\n\npanel issued its opinion on June 20, 2013, and the mandate issued on July 12, 2013.\n\nMr. Wilfong did not seek further review, so his conviction and sentence became final\n\nninety days later on September 18, 2013. See United States v. Burch, 202 F.3d 1274,\n\n1279 (10th Cir. 2000) (stating that \u201cif a prisoner does not file a petition for a writ of\n\n                                            3\n\fcertiorari with the United States Supreme Court after [his] direct appeal,\u201d his\n\nconviction becomes final \u201cwhen the time for filing a certiorari petition expires\u201d).\n\n      Over two years later, on March 4, 2016, Mr. Wilfong filed a motion under 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2255 based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson v. United States,\n\n135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). In Johnson, the Court held that an enhanced sentence under\n\nthe ACCA\u2019s residual clause violates the Due Process Clause because the residual\n\nclause is impermissibly vague. Id. at 2557. But the Court noted that its decision \u201cdoes\n\nnot call into question application of the [ACCA] to the four enumerated offenses, or\n\nthe remainder of the Act\u2019s definition of a violent felony.\u201d Id. at 2563. The Court\n\nmade Johnson\u2019s holding retroactive to cases on collateral review in Welch v. United\n\nStates, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 1265 (2016).\n\n      In its response to Mr. Wilfong\u2019s motion, the United States conceded that Mr.\n\nWilfong\u2019s larceny conviction no longer qualified as a violent felony under Johnson.\n\nBut the United States argued that Mr. Wilfong was not entitled to relief because his\n\nchallenges to his three other predicate offenses were untimely, as none of them were\n\naffected by Johnson.\n\n      The district court agreed, first ruling that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s convictions for assault\n\nwith a dangerous weapon qualify as violent felonies under the elements clause. The\n\ndistrict court then concluded that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s challenge to his federal conviction\n\nfor making a bomb threat was time-barred. Mr. Wilfong brought his challenge more\n\nthan one year after his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction became final, and Johnson\n\nwas not implicated because the sentencing court ruled that his federal conviction\n\n                                           4\n\fqualified as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause. The district court\n\nthus concluded that Mr. Wilfong was not entitled to relief and denied him a COA.\n\n      Mr. Wilfong then sought a COA in this court, asserting two claims in support.\n\nFirst, he argued that his federal conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e) is not a violent\n\nfelony under the ACCA. Second, he argued for the first time that his counsel on\n\ndirect appeal was ineffective for failing to argue that the sentencing court erred when\n\nit relied on the underlying facts in the presentence report to determine whether Mr.\n\nWilfong\u2019s \u00a7 844(e) conviction was a violent felony.\n\n      On March 17, 2017, we issued an order denying Mr. Wilfong\u2019s application for\n\na COA, concluding it was not debatable among reasonable jurists whether the district\n\ncourt correctly ruled that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely. United States\n\nv. Wilfong, No. 16-6342, 2017 WL 1032571 (10th Cir. Mar. 17, 2017) (unpublished).\n\nWe reasoned that Mr. Wilfong filed his motion more than one year from the date on\n\nwhich his conviction became final, and that \u201cJohnson is not implicated because the\n\nsentencing court concluded that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s \u00a7 844(e) conviction is a violent felony\n\nunder the elements clause, not the residual clause.\u201d Id. at *3.\n\n      Mr. Wilfong then filed a Petition for Rehearing and for Rehearing En Banc, in\n\nwhich he argued, among other things, that denying his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely\n\nviolates the Suspension Clause of the United States Constitution because it divests\n\nhim \u201cof his constitutional right to bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a\n\n\u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d He insisted that\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      the panel\u2019s restrictive, four corners application of Johnson deprives\n      [him] of the right to ever bring a claim for ineffective assistance of\n      appellate counsel based on counsel\u2019s failure to properly challenge his\n      \u00a7 844(e) conviction: before Johnson, [he] could not show prejudice;\n      after Johnson, it was too late to bring the claim.\n\n      In view of Mr. Wilfong\u2019s Suspension Clause argument, we vacated our\n\nMarch 17, 2017 order, granted panel rehearing, and granted a partial COA. United\n\nStates v. Wilfong, No. 16-6342, 2017 WL 1371299 (10th Cir. Apr. 14, 2017)\n\n(unpublished). In doing so, we \u201creaffirm[ed] our decision denying a COA on Mr.\n\nWilfong\u2019s ACCA claim\u201d on timeliness grounds, but granted a partial COA on his\n\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. Id. at *1. We also ordered the\n\nUnited States to submit a response to Mr. Wilfong\u2019s opening brief, to which Mr.\n\nWilfong submitted a reply.1\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n      We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s motion\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was untimely. See United States v. Cox, 83 F.3d 336, 338\n\n(10th Cir. 1996). After careful examination of the parties\u2019 briefing and the relevant\n\nlegal authorities, we agree with the district court and conclude that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s\n\nmotion\u2014and his ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim, in particular\u2014is\n\nuntimely.\n\n\n\n      1\n        On June 14, 2017, the United States moved to supplement the record on\nappeal to include the transcript of the sentencing hearing held on August 30, 2007, in\nCase No. CR-07-103-HE, Western District of Oklahoma. Mr. Wilfong opposes the\nmotion. Because the transcript is not material to our resolution of this appeal, we\ndeny the motion.\n                                           6\n\f      In general, a prisoner in federal custody has one year to file a \u00a7 2255 motion\n\nfrom \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d \u00a7 2255(f)(1).\n\nThat window has since passed, as Mr. Wilfong\u2019s judgment of conviction became\n\nfinal on September 18, 2013, yet he did not file his \u00a7 2255 motion until March 4,\n\n2016. Mr. Wilfong thus relies on \u00a7 2255(f)(3), under which the one-year period runs\n\nfrom \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme\n\nCourt, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made\n\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d Mr. Wilfong filed his motion\n\nless than one year after the Supreme Court decided Johnson v. United States, 135 S.\n\nCt. 2551 (2015), and he argues that his motion involves a right under Johnson. But as\n\nwe explained in our prior order, \u201cJohnson is not implicated because the sentencing\n\ncourt concluded that Mr. Wilfong\u2019s [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 844(e) conviction is a violent\n\nfelony under the elements clause, not the residual clause. . . . Thus, Johnson does not\n\nafford Mr. Wilfong the relief he seeks.\u201d United States v. Wilfong, No. 16-6342, 2017\n\nWL 1032571, at *3 (10th Cir. Mar. 17, 2017) (unpublished).\n\n      As stated, Mr. Wilfong argued for the first time in his Petition for Rehearing\n\nand for Rehearing En Banc that denying his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely violates the\n\nSuspension Clause of the United States Constitution. Because Mr. Wilfong did not\n\nraise this argument below, or even in his opening brief to this court, the argument is\n\nforfeited. See Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc., 634 F.3d 1123, 1127\u201328 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\nAnd because Mr. Wilfong does not request that we review it for plain error, we could\n\npermissibly decline to address it altogether. See id. at 1131 (\u201c[T]he failure to argue\n\n                                           7\n\ffor plain error and its application on appeal . . . surely marks the end of the road for\n\nan argument for reversal not first presented to the district court.\u201d); United States v.\n\nGames-Perez, 695 F.3d 1104, 1107\u201309 (10th Cir. 2012) (Murphy, J., concurring in\n\nthe denial of rehearing en banc) (indicating that plain error applies to an issue raised\n\nfor the first time in a petition for rehearing, but declining to address the issue because\n\nthe defendant \u201cnever even acknowledged the applicability of the plain error doctrine,\n\nlet alone attempted to satisfy its requirements\u201d). But \u201cwe are not obliged to apply\n\nforfeiture principles to [a party\u2019s] briefing omission\u201d; indeed, \u201csuch decisions are\n\ndiscretionary.\u201d United States v. McGehee, 672 F.3d 860, 873 n.5 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\n       We elect to consider Mr. Wilfong\u2019s argument under the plain-error standard of\n\nreview because it fails nonetheless. To prevail under that standard, Mr. Wilfong must\n\ndemonstrate \u201c(1) the district court erred, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected\n\nsubstantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d United States v. Mu\u00f1oz, 812 F.3d 809, 813 (10th\n\nCir. 2016).\n\n       The Suspension Clause provides that \u201c[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas\n\nCorpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the\n\npublic Safety may require it.\u201d U.S. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. \u201c[N]ot every restriction on\n\nthe writ rises to the level of a suspension.\u201d Drach v. Bruce, 305 F. App\u2019x 514, 517\n\n(10th Cir. 2008) (unpublished). And \u201cjudgments about the proper scope of the writ\n\nare normally for Congress to make.\u201d Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996). But\n\nwe have held that a restriction violates the Suspension Clause when it \u201crenders the\n\n                                             8\n\fhabeas remedy \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of detention.\u201d Miller v.\n\nMarr, 141 F.3d 976, 977 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372,\n\n381 (1977)). Mr. Wilfong bears the burden to show inadequacy or ineffectiveness. Id.\n\n       In rejecting arguments that \u00a7 2255\u2019s one-year limitation period violates the\n\nSuspension Clause, we have recognized that \u201c[t]he remedy afforded by \u00a7 2255 is not\n\nrendered inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual has been unable to\n\nobtain relief under that provision, or because an individual is procedurally barred\n\nfrom filing a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d United States v. Keebler, 49 F. App\u2019x 267, 269 (10th\n\nCir. 2002) (unpublished) (quoting Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 376 (2d\n\nCir. 1997)). Similarly, in the \u00a7 2254 context for collateral attacks to state convictions,\n\n\u201c[w]e have held that although there may be circumstances when the limitations\n\nperiod \u2018raises serious constitutional questions and possibly renders the habeas\n\nremedy inadequate and ineffective\u2019 in violation of the Suspension Clause, it can\n\nproperly be applied absent grounds for equitable tolling or a showing of actual\n\ninnocence or incompetence.\u201d Long v. Miller, 541 F. App\u2019x 800, 802 (10th Cir. 2013)\n\n(unpublished) (quoting Marr, 141 F.3d at 978).\n\n      Here, Mr. Wilfong avers that denying his ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-\n\ncounsel claim as untimely violates the Suspension Clause. He asserts that he could\n\nnot have brought that claim before the Supreme Court decided Johnson because the\n\npresence of three other predicate offenses would have precluded his ability to show\n\nprejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984). Only after the\n\nCourt decided Johnson, he argues, could he show that appellate counsel\u2019s deficient\n\n                                            9\n\fperformance was prejudicial. But by then, it was too late for him to bring his claim,\n\nthus divesting him of his right to bring it in a \u00a7 2255 motion.\n\n       Even if there was error, a question we need not reach, it was not plain. \u201cAn\n\nerror is plain if it is clear or obvious under current, well-settled law.\u201d United States v.\n\nDeChristopher, 695 F.3d 1082, 1091 (10th Cir. 2012). Before we will \u201ccharacterize a\n\nproposition of law as well-settled, we normally require precedent directly [on] point\n\nfrom the Supreme Court or our circuit or a consensus in the other circuits.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Smith, 815 F.3d 671, 675 (10th Cir. 2016). Mr. Wilfong has not met his\n\nburden to direct us to any on-point precedent from the Supreme Court, this circuit, or\n\nany other circuit. This comes as no surprise, for \u201cthere does not appear to be much\n\nthat is clear or obvious in the Suspension Clause area.\u201d Abernathy v. Wandes, 713\n\nF.3d 538, 553 (10th Cir. 2013). Accordingly, any potential error was not plain. And\n\nMr. Wilfong\u2019s Suspension Clause argument fails under plain-error review.2\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n       We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Wilfong\u2019s \u00a7 2255\n\nmotion as untimely.\n\n                                             Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                             Carolyn B. McHugh\n                                             Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n       2\n         On July 7, 2017, Mr. Wilfong moved to expand the COA to include his claim\nthat his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e) conviction is not a violent felony. For the reasons stated\nin this Order and Judgment, and in our March 17, 2017 Order, we deny the motion.\n                                            10\n\f",
