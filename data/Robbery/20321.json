Upon the State's amended motion, on March 7, 2002, community supervision\r\nwas revoked for violations of the conditions thereof, and the original punishment was\r\nimposed.  In presenting this appeal, counsel has filed an Anders (2) brief in support of a\r\nmotion to withdraw.  Based upon the rationale expressed herein, counsel's motion to\r\nwithdraw is granted and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.   \r\n\r\n\tIn support of her motion to withdraw, counsel has certified that she has diligently\r\nreviewed the record and, in her opinion, the record reflects no reversible error or grounds\r\nupon which an appeal can be predicated.  Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744-45, 87\r\nS. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967); Monroe v. State, 671 S.W.2d 583, 585 (Tex.App.--San\r\nAntonio 1984, no pet.).  Thus, she concludes the appeal is frivolous and without merit.  In\r\ncompliance with High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 813 (Tex.Cr.App. 1978), counsel has\r\ncandidly discussed why, under the controlling authorities, there is no error in the court's\r\njudgment.  Counsel has also shown that she sent a copy of the brief to appellant, and\r\ninformed appellant that, in counsel's view, the appeal is without merit.  In addition, counsel\r\nhas demonstrated that she notified appellant of his right to review the record and file a pro\r\nse brief if he desired to do so.  Appellant filed a pro se letter brief; however, the State did\r\nnot favor us with a brief.\r\n\r\n\tBy its amended motion to revoke, the State alleged numerous violations of the\r\nconditions of community supervision.  At the hearing on the State's motion, after being\r\nproperly admonished, appellant voluntarily plead true to four of the allegations in all three\r\ncause numbers and one of the allegations in cause number 41,926-A, and the State\r\nwaived the remaining allegations.  \r\n\r\n\tWhen reviewing an order revoking community supervision, the sole question before\r\nthis Court is whether the trial court abused its discretion.  Jackson v. State, 645 S.W.2d\r\n303, 305 (Tex.Cr.App. 1983).  One sufficient ground for revocation supports the trial\r\ncourt's order.  Moore v. State, 605 S.W.2d 924, 926 (Tex.Cr.App. 1980).  Also, in a\r\nrevocation proceeding, a plea of true standing alone is sufficient to support the trial court's\r\nrevocation order.  Moses v. State, 590 S.W.2d 469, 470 (Tex.Cr.App. 1979).  \r\n\r\n\tAppellate counsel presents one arguable issue in the Anders brief, to-wit: whether\r\nthe trial court could have considered the extenuating circumstances facing appellant and\r\nimposed a lesser sentence.  By his pro se letter brief, appellant concedes that he agreed\r\nto plead true to some of the allegations made by the State, but that he believed his trial\r\ncounsel would present a defense on those allegations.  He also attempts to explain the\r\ncircumstances that lead to some of the violations of his conditions of community\r\nsupervision.  However, having reviewed a transcription of the hearing, we conclude that\r\nappellant's plea of true was freely and voluntarily given and thus, is sufficient to support\r\nthe trial court's revocation order.\r\n\r\n\tWe have also made an independent examination of the entire record to determine\r\nwhether there are any arguable grounds which might support the appeal.  See  Penson v.\r\nOhio, 488 U.S. 75, 109 S. Ct. 346, 102 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1988); Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d\r\n503, 511 (Tex.Cr.App. 1991).  We have found no such grounds and agree with counsel\r\nthat the appeal is without merit and is, therefore, frivolous.  Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d\r\n684 (Tex.Cr.App. 1974); Lacy v. State, 477 S.W.2d 577, 578 (Tex.Cr.App. 1972).\r\n\r\n\tAccordingly, counsel's motion to withdraw is hereby granted and the judgment of\r\nthe trial court is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDon H. Reavis\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Justice\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not publish.\r\n1. Tex. R. App. P. 47.2(a).\r\n2. Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L.
