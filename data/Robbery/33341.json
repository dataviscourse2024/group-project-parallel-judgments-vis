In any event, we find that the allocution established the requisite elements of burglary in the first degree and that defendant knowingly and intelligently pleaded guilty thereto (see, People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9).\nIn conclusion, we note that the imposed sentence of 3 \u00a52 to 10\u00a52 years\u2019 imprisonment, which was actually a lesser term than that bargained for by defendant, was appropriate under the circumstances of this case. Thompson, J. P., Brown, Niehoff and Lawrence, JJ., concur.\n",
