Davidson was on patrol in San Leon, Texas, when he encountered\n\nappellant, who was driving a car that had a non-functioning brake light. Sergeant\n\nDavidson turned on his emergency lights to conduct a traffic stop. Instead of\n\nimmediately pulling over, appellant\u2019s vehicle \u201ccontinued to roll\u201d two or three houses\n\ndown the street before appellant pulled through a gate and into the driveway, \u201call the\n\n\n\n1\n      See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE ANN. \u00a7 481.115(a), (d) (providing that person\n      commits second-degree felony if person possesses between four and two hundred\n      grams of controlled substance listed in penalty group one); id. \u00a7 481.102(6) (listing\n      methamphetamine as controlled substance in penalty group one).\n2\n      The State presented evidence that appellant had prior felony convictions for\n      aggravated robbery and theft\u2014the two prior offenses charged in the enhancement\n      paragraphs\u2014as well as prior felony convictions for evading arrest and attempting\n      to take a weapon from a police officer and prior misdemeanor convictions for\n      terroristic threat, assault, criminal trespass, and resisting arrest. If, on trial of a\n      felony offense, it is shown that the defendant has two prior final felony convictions,\n      on conviction for the charged offense the defendant shall be confined for twenty-\n      five to ninety-nine years or for life. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 12.42(d).\n                                             2\n\fway up to the residence.\u201d The driveway was on the left side of the house, and at least\n\nthree vehicles were parked in the driveway. Another car was parked in front of the\n\ncenter of the house, and when appellant and Sergeant Davidson pulled into the\n\ndriveway, two people, including a man wearing red shorts, were standing near the\n\ncar in the center and then walked over to one of the cars on the left side of the house.\n\nAppellant pulled over to the far right side of the house and parked. Sergeant\n\nDavidson testified that although behavior such as appellant\u2019s occurs \u201cfrom time to\n\ntime,\u201d it is not normal, and, in his experience, he \u201cfind[s] people are buying time to\n\nhide things or gain distance on me to try to get out of the car faster or anything like\n\nthat.\u201d\n\n         Sergeant Davidson believed that appellant was preparing to flee the area, so\n\nDavidson parked his vehicle at the gate and ran towards appellant\u2019s vehicle.\n\nAppellant opened the door to his vehicle, but he was not able to get out before\n\nSergeant Davidson reached the car. Appellant was \u201cupset, belligerent, [and] angry,\u201d\n\nand he demanded to know why Sergeant Davidson had stopped his car. Sergeant\n\nDavidson described appellant\u2019s behavior as atypical, and, in response, he ordered\n\nappellant out of the car. Once appellant was out of the vehicle, Davidson attempted\n\nto place appellant in handcuffs due to appellant\u2019s level of aggression. Although\n\nDavidson was able to restrain appellant\u2019s right hand, appellant was acting\n\n\u201csquirrely\u201d and moving around, and Davidson could not immediately cuff\n\n\n                                           3\n\fappellant\u2019s left hand. Sergeant Davidson eventually handcuffed appellant and\n\nescorted him to Davidson\u2019s patrol car. On the way to the patrol vehicle, an\n\nunidentified person approached and spoke with appellant. Appellant asked this\n\nperson to retrieve his cigarettes from the house.\n\n      After Sergeant Davidson secured appellant in the patrol car, Davidson\n\nreturned to appellant\u2019s vehicle to perform an inventory search. When he returned,\n\nDavidson \u201cobserved some baggies that were beneath [appellant\u2019s] vehicle in view\n\non the ground by the vehicle where we were standing.\u201d Sergeant Davidson testified\n\nthat he had not noticed these baggies when he initially approached appellant\u2019s car.\n\nHe stated that, when he had first approached, he had been focused on appellant and\n\nhad not been looking for anything on the ground and \u201cnothing [had] caught [his]\n\neye.\u201d Sergeant Davidson retrieved his camera from his patrol car and took a picture\n\nof the baggies on the ground.\n\n      Sergeant Davidson testified that \u201c[a] couple of the bags were in line with the\n\nrunning board area [of appellant\u2019s vehicle] and a couple appeared in the back that\n\nwere closer in line to the rear tire.\u201d Davidson believed that the bags contained\n\nnarcotics, specifically, methamphetamine, and he took custody of the bags and\n\nsecured them in his patrol car. He acknowledged that he did not have gloves on when\n\nhe picked up these baggies and that this would affect the ability to recover\n\nfingerprints from the baggies. Davidson also testified that the weather was \u201cmildly\n\n\n                                          4\n\fhumid\u201d that night and that there was \u201ca light light condensation on the ground around\n\nthe bags.\u201d There was, however, no condensation on the bags themselves, and despite\n\nthe proximity of the bags to the tires of appellant\u2019s vehicle, the bags were sitting on\n\ntop of the grass, \u201cnot crushed into it.\u201d Sergeant Davidson thus believed that the bags\n\nwere \u201cfresh\u201d and that they belonged to appellant. When asked why he believed that,\n\nDavidson stated, \u201cThe area where [the bags] were is the area where we were while\n\nhe was moving around before I walked away and brought him back to my car.\u201d\n\n      The trial court admitted a copy of the recording from Sergeant Davidson\u2019s\n\ndash-camera in his patrol car. On the recording, appellant asked a person to \u201cget his\n\ncigarettes out of the house.\u201d When Sergeant Davidson searched appellant\u2019s vehicle,\n\nhe discovered cigarettes in the center console of the car. Davidson stated that he\n\nbelieved appellant was being deceptive when he made this request and that he\n\nassumed that, by asking the person to get cigarettes, appellant \u201cwas trying to get [the\n\nother person] to go to the car.\u201d Davidson believed that appellant had wanted this\n\nperson to go to appellant\u2019s car and \u201cpick up what was on the ground.\u201d Sergeant\n\nDavidson testified that there were no other vehicles near appellant\u2019s car and no\n\npeople in the immediate area around appellant\u2019s car, although someone did at one\n\npoint come out of the house where appellant had stopped his car.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Sergeant Davidson about\n\npicking the baggies up with his bare hands.3 Counsel also questioned Davidson about\n\nwhether the baggies were underneath the vehicle, and Davidson stated, \u201c[a] couple\n\nwere under the vehicle along . . . the running board area near the under side.\u201d\n\nCounsel showed Davidson one of the pictures Davidson had taken at the scene and\n\npointed out that it did not appear that the baggies were underneath the car. Davidson\n\ntestified, \u201cThey are clarified to being close to the under side of it.\u201d Davidson also\n\nagreed with counsel that, while he had testified that there was condensation on the\n\nground, no condensation on the ground or on the tire was visible in the scene\n\nphotographs. No contraband was recovered from inside appellant\u2019s car.\n\n      Defense counsel also questioned Sergeant Davidson about the contents of the\n\ndashcam video and, during his questioning, used a photograph of the house counsel\n\nhad taken at a date after appellant\u2019s arrest. Davidson agreed with the defense counsel\n\nthat there were several cars located to the left of the residence where appellant\n\nstopped, as well as one \u201cmore centered\u201d in front of the house, and appellant pulled\n\nup to the right side of the house. The video shows two people standing around one\n\nof the other vehicles, including a man wearing red shorts. These people later\n\n\n\n3\n      Defense counsel called Galveston County Sheriff\u2019s Office Captain T. Keele, who\n      testified that, in his opinion, the best practice is for officers to wear gloves when\n      picking up and handling items that might have evidentiary value, but departmental\n      policy does not mandate this.\n                                            6\n\fapproached the house and then walked back to the other vehicle. Sergeant Davidson\n\ntestified that he did not investigate who these people were and that, instead, he had\n\nbeen concerned with appellant and his vehicle. Sergeant Davidson also agreed with\n\ndefense counsel that the person appellant spoke to at the scene and asked to retrieve\n\nhis cigarettes, was a separate person from the two people standing around the other\n\nvehicle and this person did not become involved in Davidson\u2019s investigation.\n\nDavidson testified that this other person did not go near appellant\u2019s vehicle, so he\n\ndid not feel it was necessary to investigate this person any further.\n\n      After other deputies arrived at the scene, Sergeant Davidson\u2019s dashcam\n\ncontinued recording, but no audio was available. One of the other deputies\n\napproached the front porch of the house, where at least one person was standing.\n\nSergeant Davidson did not know which deputy approached the house, he did not\n\nknow if that deputy spoke to anyone on the porch of the house, and he did not\n\nidentify any of the people who were near the house.\n\n      On re-direct examination, Sergeant Davidson agreed with the prosecutor that\n\nthis was a \u201cthrow down\u201d case, in which the suspect attempted to get rid of the\n\nnarcotics that he possessed. When asked when suspects typically throw their drugs,\n\nDavidson stated, \u201cA lot of times when they are [going] to be placed in custody or if\n\nthere is a scuffle, they may try to turn around and get away and throw it or toss it.\u201d\n\nHe testified that he has worked hundreds of drug cases and that he has never \u201cwalked\n\n\n                                           7\n\fup and found drugs lying around.\u201d Davidson testified that he believed the contraband\n\nhe discovered belonged to appellant, and he stated his rationale for this belief:\n\n\u201cBased on just from the start. The attitude I received when I got him out of the car\n\nto the inability to get him under [my] control, the movement, suddenly being calm\n\nafter we moved away from the vehicle that led me to believe they all came from\n\nhim.\u201d\n\n        Rachel Aubel, a forensic scientist for the Texas Department of Public Safety,\n\ntested the substances recovered from near appellant\u2019s vehicle. Aubel testified that\n\ntwo baggies from the scene contained a total of 4.28 grams of methamphetamine and\n\nthat two orange tablets, also recovered from the scene, contained a total of 0.37\n\ngrams of methamphetamine.\n\n        During closing argument, defense counsel heavily criticized Sergeant\n\nDavidson\u2019s investigation, stating that Davidson \u201cdid as little as possible on his job.\u201d\n\nDefense counsel stated:\n\n        Then how many people are on the scene maybe three. We don\u2019t know\n        for sure. We can see three. I don\u2019t know how many people may or may\n        not have been in the house. I don\u2019t agree that we can see that there is\n        not another person on video because there are dark areas there. I do\n        agree there was not a car there and that\u2019s why [appellant] chose that\n        particular parking spot because he thought he was parking,\n        remember. . . . I can\u2019t interview the person that [appellant] talked to\n        that Sergeant Davidson testified was the possibly third person on scene\n        and ask about their interchange because [Davidson] didn\u2019t tell me who\n        he is. He didn\u2019t collect that information. He didn\u2019t say hey, you\u2019re on\n        my scene. I need to know who you are all even just as a witness. He\n        didn\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t ask the guy in the red shorts, I can\u2019t ask him hey,\n                                           8\n\f      have you ever been arrested for methamphetamine. I don\u2019t have that\n      opportunity because Sergeant Davidson didn\u2019t think it was important\n      enough to ask him. When you watch the video, I want you to watch,\n      they pull up two people disappear into the house. Later they appear and\n      then go back into the house. How do I know that the man in the red\n      shorts didn\u2019t go in front of the house freaking out, run around the back\n      of the house and throw the dope? How do I know? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t.\n      I don\u2019t even know who the man is. I can\u2019t ask him. How do I know if\n      two of the other people on the video don\u2019t have prior convictions for\n      possession of a methamphetamine? I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know who they are.\n\n      Counsel also argued:\n\n      I want you to watch those people come and go [from the house], the at\n      least three that we know of. I suggest to you there could\u2019ve been more.\n      I don\u2019t know. I think I see on the video someone knocking on the door\n      and talking to the people inside the residence but I don\u2019t have the\n      benefit of knowing whether they did or not because Davidson didn\u2019t\n      document anything, won\u2019t let me know what happened with the\n      deputies and no one is here to testify. So, I don\u2019t know. Maybe there\n      were five people inside the house. Maybe there was six. I have no idea.\n      Is it reasonable for me to assert that one of the unidentified people on\n      the scene went and tossed drugs, absolutely. I don\u2019t know what they are\n      doing. There is three people that could be freaking out. There is a cop\n      out there. Got somebody pulled out and there is a car right there. Let\n      me throw my stuff there before they come to me.\n\nCounsel further argued that it was reasonable to believe the drugs were already\n\npresent on the ground when appellant pulled up to the house, noting that the baggies\n\nwere \u201cnowhere near underneath [the] car.\u201d He argued that Sergeant Davidson\n\narrested appellant \u201cand Mr. Red Shorts comes over there [to the car] and tosses the\n\ndope.\u201d\n\n      In response, the State argued that appellant, upon realizing that he could not\n\nrun from the car once he pulled into the driveway, \u201cdid the best thing he could\u201d by\n                                         9\n\ftossing the drugs to the ground and trying to put at least some distance between\n\nhimself and the drugs.\n\n      The State then made the following argument:\n\n      Your common sense tells you if nobody was sitting over there [by\n      where appellant parked], there were no cars and there were no people\n      those drugs didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere. Did someone walk out of the\n      back door while there is a police officer on the scene, run around while\n      the police officer is back at his car and runs and throws the drugs under\n      the car, who believes that? You guys don\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t believe\n      that either. Neither did Sergeant Davidson. Now, yes, do I wish I had\n      DNA and do I wish I had fingerprints, do I wish I knew who the people\n      were, yes, I do. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know who that dope\n      belonged to. And let me tell you something. [The address of the house,]\n      these pictures [admitted during cross-examination of Sergeant\n      Davidson] were taken by [defense counsel]. If [counsel] wanted to go\n      out there and talk to them, he should have knocked on the door. They\n      are there for him to talk to.\n\nDefense counsel objected on the basis that the prosecutor\u2019s statement \u201cis shifting the\n\nburden.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cProceed,\u201d and the prosecutor ended his\n\nargument by stating that Sergeant Davidson \u201cdid his job that night\u201d and that the\n\ndrugs recovered from the scene belonged to appellant.\n\n      Ultimately, the jury found appellant guilty of the offense of possession of\n\nbetween four and two hundred grams of methamphetamine. After finding the\n\nallegations in two enhancement paragraphs true, the jury assessed appellant\u2019s\n\npunishment at twenty-five years\u2019 confinement. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                            Improper Jury Argument\n\n      In his sole issue on appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred by\n\nallowing the State to make an improper jury argument. Specifically, appellant argues\n\nthat the prosecutor\u2019s statement \u201cIf [defense counsel] wanted to go out there [to the\n\nhouse where appellant was arrested] and talk to [the other unidentified people at the\n\nscene], he should have knocked on the door\u201d improperly shifted the burden of proof\n\nto appellant to affirmatively produce evidence in his defense.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on an objection regarding improper jury\n\nargument for an abuse of discretion. See Garcia v. State, 126 S.W.3d 921, 924 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2004); Stahmann v. State, 548 S.W.3d 46, 68 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus\n\nChristi 2018, pet. granted); Williams v. State, 417 S.W.3d 162, 174 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2013, pet. ref\u2019d) (\u201cA trial court has broad discretion to control\n\nthe scope of closing argument.\u201d). Proper jury argument typically falls within one of\n\nfour general areas: (1) summation of the evidence; (2) reasonable deduction from\n\nthe evidence; (3) answer to argument of opposing counsel; and (4) plea for law\n\nenforcement. Brown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 570 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). \u201cThe\n\nState is afforded wide latitude in its jury arguments and may draw all reasonable,\n\nfair, and legitimate inferences from the evidence.\u201d Williams, 417 S.W.3d at 174. It\n\nis permissible for a prosecutor to \u201cattack the defense\u2019s argument.\u201d Id. When\n\n\n                                         11\n\fexamining challenges to a jury argument, we consider the remark in the context in\n\nwhich it appears. Mims v. State, 434 S.W.3d 265, 275 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2014, no pet.).\n\nB.    Preservation of Error\n\n      As an initial matter, we address whether appellant preserved his complaint\n\nconcerning the State\u2019s allegedly improper jury argument for appellate review.\n\n      Generally, to preserve a complaint for appellate review, the party must make\n\nthe complaint to the trial court by timely request, objection, or motion that states the\n\ngrounds for the ruling sought with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware\n\nof the complaint, and the trial court must rule on the request, objection, or motion,\n\n\u201ceither expressly or implicitly.\u201d TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). \u201cThe right to a trial\n\nuntainted by improper jury argument is forfeitable.\u201d Hernandez v. State, 538 S.W.3d\n\n619, 622 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018). To preserve a complaint about improper jury\n\nargument for appellate review, the defendant must pursue his objection to an adverse\n\nruling from the trial court. Id.; Hinojosa v. State, 433 S.W.3d 742, 761 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nSan Antonio 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). A trial court\u2019s ruling on a matter need not be expressly\n\nstated if its actions or other statements \u201cotherwise unquestionably indicate a ruling.\u201d\n\nMontanez v.

(stating, in context of objection to admission of extraneous offense\n\nevidence during questioning of witness, that trial court\u2019s response of \u201cYou may\n\nproceed\u201d to objection \u201cwas an attempt to ignore or avoid the objection and did not\n\nconstitute a conclusory or definite ruling adverse to the objection\u201d and therefore no\n\nerror was preserved for appellate review).\n\n\n                                          13\n\f      Here, the following occurred during the State\u2019s closing argument:\n\n      The State:          Now, yes, do I wish I had DNA and do I wish I had\n                          fingerprints, do I wish I knew who those people\n                          were, yes, I do. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know\n                          who that dope belonged to. And let me tell you\n                          something. [The address of the house] those\n                          pictures were taken by [defense counsel]. If he\n                          wanted to go out there and talk to them, he should\n                          have knocked on the door. They are there for him to\n                          talk to.\n\n      Defense counsel: I am going to object, Your Honor. That is shifting\n                       the burden.\n\n      The Court:          Proceed.\n\nThe trial court\u2019s response, \u201cProceed,\u201d does not constitute a ruling, either express or\n\nimplicit, on appellant\u2019s objection. See Grayson, 192 S.W.3d at 793; see also\n\nMontanez, 195 S.W.3d at 104 (providing that ruling need not be express as long as\n\ntrial court\u2019s actions or other statements \u201cotherwise unquestionably indicate a\n\nruling\u201d). We therefore hold that because appellant did not receive an adverse ruling\n\non his objection to improper jury argument, he has failed to preserve this complaint\n\nfor appellate review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(2); Hernandez, 538 S.W.3d at 622\n\n(stating that, to preserve complaint concerning improper jury argument, defendant\n\nmust pursue objection to adverse ruling); Grayson, 192 S.W.3d at 793 (holding that\n\nbecause trial court did not make ruling on improper jury argument objection when\n\ncourt stated \u201cLet\u2019s proceed\u201d in response to objection, defendant preserved nothing\n\nfor appellate review).\n                                         14\n\fC.    Analysis\n\n      Even assuming that appellant properly preserved his complaint concerning\n\nimproper jury argument for appellate review, we conclude that the challenged\n\nargument was permissible.\n\n      Appellant complains that the State improperly shifted the burden of proof to\n\nappellant during closing argument when the prosecutor stated, \u201cIf [defense counsel]\n\nwanted to go out there and talk to them [the other people at the scene who were not\n\nidentified in the police investigation], he should have knocked on the door. They are\n\nthere for him to talk to.\u201d Appellant argues that this statement \u201casked the jury to\n\nrequire counsel for [appellant] to attempt to identify the persons present at the time\n\nAppellant was arrested,\u201d which is \u201cthe heart of shifting the burden from the State to\n\nthe defense.\u201d\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals has held that, during argument, the prosecutor\n\nmay permissibly comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to produce witnesses and\n\nevidence \u201cso long as the remark does not fault the defendant for exercising his right\n\nnot to testify.\u201d Jackson v. State, 17 S.W.3d 664, 674 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000);\n\nHinojosa, 433 S.W.3d at 762; Baines v. State, 401 S.W.3d 104, 108\u201310 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (holding that prosecutor\u2019s statement that\n\ndefendant \u201chas the same subpoena power\u201d and could have called two witnesses to\n\ntestify in his defense was permissible comment about defendant\u2019s failure to produce\n\n\n                                         15\n\fevidence in his favor, did not improperly shift burden to defense, and did not\n\nimproperly comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify); Caron v. State, 162 S.W.3d\n\n614, 618 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.) (noting that State may\n\ncomment on defendant\u2019s failure to present evidence in his favor and holding that\n\nprosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]f there is something out there that is going to\n\nexonerate you, you want to make it known\u201d was proper and did not shift burden of\n\nproof). We look at the challenged language from the jury\u2019s standpoint and determine\n\nwhether the prosecutor\u2019s comment \u201cwas manifestly intended or was of such a\n\ncharacter that the jury would necessarily and naturally take it as a comment on the\n\ndefendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d Hinojosa, 433 S.W.3d at 762 (quoting Bustamante v.\n\nState, 48 S.W.3d 761, 765 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001)). If the prosecutor\u2019s language can\n\nbe reasonably construed as referring to the defendant\u2019s failure to produce testimony\n\nor evidence from sources other than himself, reversal is not required. Id.\n\n      Here, during closing argument, defense counsel repeatedly attacked Sergeant\n\nDavidson\u2019s investigation, taking issue with, among other things, the fact that\n\nSergeant Davidson did not investigate and identify the other people present at the\n\nhouse where appellant was arrested, which meant that counsel had no way of\n\nquestioning these individuals himself or inquiring into the backgrounds of these\n\nindividuals, such as whether they had past convictions for methamphetamine\n\npossession, which could have produced favorable evidence for appellant. The State\n\n\n                                         16\n\facknowledged some of the shortcomings in Sergeant\u2019s Davidson\u2019s investigation, but\n\nstated that the defense\u2019s theory\u2014that one of the other unidentified individuals at the\n\nscene, after seeing Davidson handcuff appellant and place him in his patrol car, ran\n\nover to appellant\u2019s car and dropped the drugs nearby\u2014was unreasonable. The State\n\nthen noted that defense counsel had visited the scene and taken pictures of the house,\n\nwhich were admitted into evidence during cross-examination of Sergeant Davidson.\n\nThe prosecutor stated, \u201cIf [defense counsel] wanted to go out there and talk to them\n\n[the unidentified people at the scene], he should have knocked on the door. They are\n\nthere for him to talk to.\u201d\n\n      This statement by the prosecutor does not remark on appellant\u2019s failure to\n\ntestify at trial. Instead, the State argued that, despite Sergeant Davidson\u2019s failure to\n\nidentify the other people at the scene, defense counsel could have conducted his own\n\ninvestigation by going to the house to see if he could uncover a witness who could\n\nprovide favorable testimony for appellant. This statement can reasonably be\n\nconstrued as a comment on the defense\u2019s failure to produce evidence and testimony\n\narising from a source other than appellant himself, which constitutes permissible\n\njury argument. See Hinojosa, 433 S.W.3d at 762 (\u201cReversal is not required where\n\nthe language can be reasonably construed as referring to a defendant\u2019s failure to\n\nproduce testimony or evidence from sources other than himself.\u201d); Baines, 401\n\nS.W.3d at 109 (holding that prosecutor\u2019s comment that defendant could have called\n\n\n                                          17\n\ftwo witnesses, who defendant argued had actually committed charged offense, to\n\ntestify to support his defensive theory \u201cwent to the credibility of appellant\u2019s defense\n\nand did not shift the burden of proving the elements of the offense\u201d). We conclude\n\nthat the prosecutor\u2019s statement during argument did not impermissibly shift the\n\nState\u2019s burden to prove the elements of the charged offense of possession of\n\nmethamphetamine to the defense. We therefore hold that the trial court did not err\n\nby allowing this statement.\n\n      We overrule appellant\u2019s sole issue.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Evelyn V.
