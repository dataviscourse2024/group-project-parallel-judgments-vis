    "summary": "\nK'ror from, Brown District Court.\n Miles brought his action for verbal slander, alleging that Harrington \u201c maliciously intending to injure the good name and character of the said plaintiff and to cause it to be believed that he had been guilty of the crime of larceny, on the 20th of July, 1871, in a certain discourse which he then had of and concerning the plaintiff, and in the presence and hearing of' divers- good people, falsely and maliciously spoke . and published of and concerning the said plaintiff the false, scandalous and malicious words following, that is to say, \u2018Miles/ (meaning the plaintiff,) \u2018stole my dog/ \u2018he/ (meaning the plaintiff,) \u2018stole my dog/ \u2018Miles/ (meaning the plaintiff,) \u2018came to my house and stole my dog/ \u2018Miles/ (meaning the plaintiff,) \u2018 horsewhipped me, and dragged my property off/ meaning thereby that the said plaintiff had stolen his (the said defendant\u2019s) dog. * * * By means of the speaking of which said defamatory words the said plaintiff hath been greatly injured in his good name and character, to the damage of said plaintiff of $2,000.\u201d Harrington answered, first, a general denial; second, that plaintiff had previously given a small pup to defendant\u2019s child, and in September 1870 had entered upon defendant\u2019s premises and forcibly dragged said pup away; that in July 1871, \u201cin a certain discourse defendant had before a certain jury in a cause then pending before a justice of the peace, the defendant, speaking of the fact that said plaintiff had come upon defendant\u2019s premises and taken said dog away without consent, did then and there say to said jury, \u2018 Gentlemen of the jury, this man Miles came upon my premises and stole away a dog/ that defendant never at any time used any other words charging any offense concerning said dog than as above stated, and defendant denies that by the use of the words aforesaid he did impute or was understood to impute to plaintiff the commission of the crime of larceny, or any other crime whatever.\u201d The action was tried at the August Term 1872. Verdict for plaintiff for one dollar damages, and judgment on the verdict for said damages and costs of- suit. Harrington brings the case here on error. The only question is, are words charging the stealing of a dog, actionable per se. We say not. Words to be actionable per se must impute a felony: 1 Hil. on Torts, 228, 245; 2 Monroe, 65; 5 Blackf., 293; 6 Tenn., 691; 2 Salkeld, 676; 3 Hill, 22; 8 Tell, 457; 1 Am. Lead. Cases, 110; 48 111., 385; Breeze, 300; Townsend on Libel and Slander, 152; 13 Johns., 124; 36 Barb., 438; 16 id., 367; 9 Wend., 141; 23 Conn., 590; 3 Serg. & Rawle, 255; 3 Iowa, 316; 21 Penn. St., 522; 7 Yt., 439; 21 Ala., 379. \u25a0 At common law a dog is not the subject of larceny: 2 Wharton Am. Crim. Law, 440, \u00a71755; 4 Blackst. Com., 235. A dog is not property: 1 Minn., 292; 100 Mass., 136. The specific question now before the court as to whether it is actionable to charge a man with stealing a dog, was settled in the negative in the case of Findlay v. Bear, 8 Serg. & Rawle, 571. 1. A charge of stealing imports moral turpitude, and is punishable by law. Words imputing to the plaintiff below an act of a criminal nature for which he could be subjected to punishment are actionable per se: 3 Wis., 709; 17 Wis., 78; 3 Chand., 211; 3 Hill, 21. 2. Dogs are the subject of larceny. They were perhaps not so at common law. If not, the reason was, that larceny, was punishable with death, and to sacrifice a man for a dog would be absurd and monstrous: 1 Parker\u2019s Or. Rep., 593. The reason of the rule failing in this country, the rule must also fail: 4 Par. Cr. R., 386; 34 N. H., 523. But if such was the common-law rule the rule was changed in this state by \u00a7 2 of ch. 129, laws of 1867; and if that statute has since been repealed, the repeal did not have the effect to restore the common law. But under \u00a7 3, ch. 119, Gen. Stat. of 1868, the common law on this subject is not in force. A dog is recognized as property, by \u00a7 44 of ch. 104, Gen. Stat. The owner is made liable for damages, etc. The owner of a dog at common law was and is liable for injuries done by him, after notice of his vicious character. The authorities are too numerous to cite. And when a dog is killed, without just cause or provocation, the owner may recover: 1 Saund., 84; 1 Sid., 336; 1 Sev., 216; 2 Keb., 237; 7 Car. & P., 572; 1 B. & Adi., 620; 1 Car. & P., 104; 1 Moody & R., 15; 1 Camp., 41; 10 Ire., 259; 4 Cowen, 351. Even though the statute authorize the hilling of a dog, it will not authorize the conversion of one: 1 Met., 555; 1 Bish. on Cr. Law, \u00a7 1034, note. That a dog is property, and that the owner may maintain trespass for his value, we cite 4 Sneed, 468; 27 \u2022 Ala., 480; 4 Dev. & B., 146; 13 Ire., 33; 6 S. & R., 34; 6 Barr, 318. 2 Bish. Cr. L., \u00a7 787. If a dog is property, and trespass or trover may be maintained for injury to him, or for his value in conversion, it is most illogical to say that he is not the subject of larceny. If he is \u201cpersonal property, or any valuable thing whatever,\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 80 of ch. 31 of Gen. Stat. of 1868, it is larceny to steal him. If the general current of American authorities, establish him to be \u201cpersonal property,\u201d and our statute defines the stealing of \u2019\u201c personal property, or any valuable thing,\u201d to be larceny, and prescribed for it a punishment, it is impossible to say that dogs are not the subject of larceny. And if Harrington intended to charge Miles with the crime of larceny by charging him with stealing any article, he is liable, and the words are actionable ye?-se; 28 Iowa, 37; 4 Am. Rep., 151.",

            "opinion_text": "\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\nBrewer, J.:\nThe only question really involved in this case is, whether a dog is the subject of larceny; for if it is, then words charging the stealing of a dog are actionable per se, as 'charging a crime involving moral turpitude. It may be conceded that at common law the answer would have been in the negative: 2 Wharton Am. Cr. Law, \u00a71755; 4 Blackstone\u2019s Com., 236; Findlay v. Bear, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 571. But under our statutes we think a different rule obtains. By \u00a778 of the crimes act, (Gen. Stat., 332,) \u201cthe taking and carrying away of any money, goods, rights in action, or other personal property or valuable thing whatever,\u201d is declared to *484be larceny. Now if a clog is personal property, or a thing of value, it would seem plain that the stealing of one was larceny within the statute. That a dog was property, was conceded at common law, as also that the owner might maintain a civil action for its loss: 4 Blackstone, 236. And this doctrine has universally been recognized in this country. Perry v. Phipps, 10 Iredell, 259; Hinckley v. Emmerson, 4 Cowen, 251; Parker v. Wise, 27 Ala., 480; Wheatly v. Harris, 4 Sneed, 468; Cummings v. Perham, 1 Mich., 555; Lentz v. Stroth, 6 Serg. &amp; R., 34. In our own state the legislature at one time passed an act levying a tax on dogs: Laws 1867, p. 215, ch. 129. This act in one of its sections speaks of \u201c owners of dogs.\u201d The same language is found in \u00a7 44 of ch. 105, Gen. Stat. p. 1011, where the owner of a dog is declared liable for injuries to sheep. It seems impossible in the light of these legislative and judicial expressions to decide that a dog is not property, nor a thing of value. And while the common law is'continued in force in this state it is only \u201cin aid of the general statutes,\u201d and as modified by constitutional and statutory laws, judicial decisions, and the conditions and wants of the people:\u201d Gen. Stat., 1127, \u00a73. We are constrained therefore to hold that a dog is property; that the stealing of one is larceny; and that words charging the stealing of a dog are actionable per se. See further as authorities, People v. Maloney, 1 Parker Cr. R., 593; State v. McDuffie, 34 N. H., 523.\nThe judgment of the district court will be affirmed.\nAll the Justices concurring.\n",
