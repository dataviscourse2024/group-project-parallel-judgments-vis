            "opinion_text": "\nPER CURIAM:\nDefendant-Appellant Ulysses Antoine Banks (\u201cBanks\u201d) appeals from the amended judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Eg-inton, /.), entered on September 4, 2013, which sentenced Banks, on remand from the March 26, 2013 order of this Court, to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment for unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Banks\u2019s sole challenge in the present appeal asserts that the district court erred when it calculated his criminal history category and base offense level by relying on prior sentences imposed upon pleas entered in accordance with North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). Because we conclude that a sentence imposed upon entry of an Alford plea qualifies as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l), we affirm the judgment of the district court.\nBACKGROUND\nI. Initial Sentence\nOn November 8, 2011, Banks pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).1 The plea agreement stipulated that on May 20, 2011, Banks knowingly possessed a Beretta Model 21A, .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol, which had previously traveled in interstate commerce and which Banks had on his person when Nor-walk police officers arrested him following a traffic stop. The agreement further recited that Banks had sustained prior felony convictions in state court on August 14, 2008, for sale of a controlled substance, and on October 26, 2005, for assault in the first degree and robbery in the third degree. The agreement therefore set forth the parties\u2019 understanding that Banks was subject to a 180-month mandatory minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because he had previously sustained three qualifying felony convictions.\nOn May 23, 2012, the district court held a sentencing hearing. Defense counsel communicated Banks\u2019s concern that a 15-year sentence was unduly harsh, because it was predominantly premised on sentences imposed for three prior convictions, one of which received no criminal history points, and another two of which were entered following Alford pleas that Banks offered in exchange for a sentence of little more than time served. The district court dismissed this argument on the basis of its *89\u201cinability to really look back into the state court situation.\u201d : \u2022 Transcript of Sentencing Hearing at 7, United States v. Banks, No. 3:11-CR-00165 (WWE) (D.Conn. May 23, 2012). After adopting the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) calculation embodied in the plea agreement and the Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) \u2014 both of which reflected Banks\u2019s status as an Armed Career Criminal \u2014 the district court sentenced Banks principally to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.\nII. Initial Appeal\nAfter Banks timely filed a notice of appeal, the parties received and reviewed the transcript of the guilty plea underlying Banks\u2019s 2008 conviction for sale of a controlled substance and discovered that it did not qualify as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA.2 Accordingly, the parties jointly moved this Court to vacate the May 23, 2012 sentence and remand to the district court for a full resentencing. On March 26, 2013, this Court remanded the case for the district court to determine the subsection of Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 21a-277 applicable to the 2008 drug offense and, if appropriate, to vacate Banks\u2019s May 23, 2012 sentence and impose a new sentence. On remand, the district court vacated the May 23, 2012 sentence.\nIII. Resentencing\nUpon resentencing, the district court concluded that Banks\u2019s base offense level was 24 because he unlawfully possessed a firearm after \u201csustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Namely, on October 26, 2005, Banks entered Alford pleas in Connecticut Superior Court to both third-degree robbery and attempted first-degree assault pursuant to a deal in which he would receive a sentence of imprisonment amounting to essentially time served.3 The district court again rejected Banks\u2019s argument that it should disregard the two sentences imposed as a result of his Alford pleas, and relied on these sentences both in increasing Banks\u2019s base offense level from 14 to 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and in adding six points to his criminal history, thereby placing Banks in criminal history category IV under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1. After applying a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the district court concluded that Banks\u2019s advisory Guideline range was 57 to 71 months, and imposed a sentence of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.\nDISCUSSION\nThe sole issue on this appeal concerns whether the district court properly determined Banks\u2019s base offense level and criminal history category when, in making both of those determinations, the district court relied on sentences imposed for convictions entered pursuant to Alford pleas. Specifically, Banks argues that the sentences resulting from his Alford pleas to robbery and assault do not constitute \u201cpri- or sentences\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, because that section enumerates several dispositions qualifying *90as an \u201cadjudication of guilt\u201d but omits any reference to Alford pleas. For the following reasons, we disagree.\nI. Standard of Review\nWhether the district court correctly interpreted a provision in the Guidelines is a question of law that we review de novo. United States v. Cuello, 357 F.3d 162, 164 (2d Cir.2004). We also review de novo \u201cthe scope of a district court\u2019s authority to make factual findings,\u201d United States v. Rosa, 507 F.3d 142, 151 (2d Cir.2007), as well as a district court\u2019s determination that \u201ca prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense warranting a sentencing enhancement,\u201d United States v. Walker, 595 F.3d 441, 443 (2d Cir.2010).\nII. Analysis\nA. \u201cPrior Sentence\u201d Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2\nSection 4A1.1 of the Guidelines governs the calculation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history category. The applicable category is determined by adding together the criminal history points associated with each of the defendant\u2019s qualifying \u201cprior sentences,\u201d which are determined by the length of the sentence imposed. A defendant\u2019s prior sentences are also relevant to determining his base offense level for unlawful possession of a firearm insofar as Section 2K2.1 provides for a ten-point increase where the defendant has previously sustained \u201cat least two felony convictions of ... a crime of violence,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), because only convictions classified as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d may trigger this enhancement, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.10.4 \u2022\nSection 4A1.2 in turn defines the term \u201cprior sentence,\u201d explaining:\nThe term \u201cprior sentence\u201d means any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense.\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). Relying on the principle that expressio unius est exclusio alterius \u2014 \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d \u2014 Qi Hang Guo v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 422 F.3d 61, 64 (2d Cir.2005) (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1635 (7th ed.1999)), Banks argues that the omission of Alford pleas from this enumerated list is dispositive in establishing that a sentence imposed upon the entry of an Alford plea does not qualify as a \u201cprior sentence.\u201d\nBanks\u2019s argument is unavailing because the plain language of Section 4A1.2(a)(l) provides that the term \u201cprior sentence\u201d encompasses a sentence imposed upon an adjudication of guilt made by guilty plea, and \u201c[a]n Alford plea is a guilty plea.\u201d Abimbola v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 173, 181 (2d Cir.2004) (emphasis in original). \u201cThe distinguishing feature of an Alford plea is that the defendant does not confirm the factual basis for the plea.\u201d United States v. Savage, 542 F.3d 959, 962 (2d Cir.2008). Despite these accompanying protestations of innocence, the defendant nonetheless enters a plea of guilty. See Alford, 400 U.S. at 33, 37, 91 S.Ct. 160 (holding that a court can accept a plea \u201cdenominated a plea of guilty,\u201d despite the defendant\u2019s pro*91testations of innocence). Accordingly, the omission of Alford pleas \u201cfrom \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l) most likely reflects an understanding that it was unnecessary to list it as a separate disposition.\u201d United States v. Mackins, 218 F.3d 263, 268 (3d Cir.2000).\nThis Court reached the same conclusion when it addressed an analogous challenge brought under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). In Abimbola, we rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that his Alford plea to the Connecticut offense of third-degree larceny did not constitute a \u201cconviction\u201d under the INA where the relevant statute defined \u201cconviction\u201d with reference to \u201ca plea of guilty or nolo conten-dere,\u201d but failed to mention Alford pleas.5 378 F.3d at 180-81. (emphasis omitted) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A)). In concluding that the plain language of the INA encompassed Alford pleas, this Court held that, by definition, \u201c[a]n Alford plea is simply a guilty plea, with evidence in the record of guilt, typically accompanied by the defendant\u2019s protestation of innocence and his or her unequivocal desire to enter the plea.\u201d Id. at 181 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nFurthermore, in Abimbola, we rejected the appellant\u2019s contention that Congress\u2019s failure to specifically include Alford pleas while explicitly listing pleas of nolo con-tendere reflected congressional intent to exclude Alford pleas. Id. To the contrary, we held that \u201c[t]he inclusion of nolo contendere pleas in the statute ... reflects that Congress focused the sanction of removal on a criminal conviction as opposed to an admission of guilt.\u201d Id. Likewise, the Guidelines\u2019 enumeration of nolo contendere pleas in Section 4A1.2(a)(l) reflects Congress\u2019s intent that the computation of the applicable criminal history category be \u201ckeyed primarily to the number and length of a defendant\u2019s prior sentences,\u201d United States v. Mishoe, 241 F.3d 214, 218 (2d Cir.2001), independent of the manner in which guilt is adjudicated prior to that sentence being imposed.\nOur statutory interpretation is not altered by the single reference to Alford pleas elsewhere in the Guidelines. In an effort to ascribe meaning to Congress\u2019s omission of Alford pleas from Section 4A1.2(a)(l), Banks points to the explicit inclusion of Alford pleas in Section 8A1.2, which governs the sentencing of organizations. The application notes to this provision define a \u201cprior criminal adjudication,\u201d for the purposes of Chapter Eight of the Guidelines, as \u201cconviction by trial, plea of guilty (including an Alford plea), or plea of nolo contendere.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 8A1.2 cmt. n.3(G). The inclusion of Alford pleas in Section 8A1.2 does not, however, suggest that they were intentionally omitted from Section 4A1.2(a)(l), because Section 4A1.2(a)(l) was enacted on November 1, 1987, whereas Chapter Eight was later added by amendment on November 1, 1991. See Mackins, 218 F.3d at 268 n. 3. Under such circumstances, the parenthetical language in Chapter Eight could be read to suggest Congress\u2019s intent to clarify that Alford pleas are nothing more than a variety of guilty plea. See United States v. King, 673 F.3d 274, 282 (4th Cir.2012) (citing Mackins, 218 F.3d at 268 n. 3). Accordingly, we reject Banks\u2019s contention that the plain language of Section 4A1.2(a)(l) excludes sentences imposed *92upon the entry of an Alford plea from the definition of a \u201cprior sentence.\u201d\nB. Second Circuit Treatment of Alford Pleas\nMoreover, Banks\u2019s argument is significantly undermined by our decision in Savage. There, we held that a conviction entered in state court following an Alford plea did not trigger the sentencing enhancements in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) because the underlying conviction in that case did not necessarily rest upon a predicate offense under the modified categorical approach. 542 F.3d at 966. In reaching this conclusion, we expressly presumed that, in situations where the modified categorical approach is satisfied, \u201ca conviction entered pursuant to an Alford plea may serve as a predicate offense under Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1[ (a) ](2).\u201d Id. at 964. Indeed, the core analysis in Savage would be rendered superfluous if Alford pleas are categorically disqualified from inclusion in Guidelines computations. Although the parties in Savage did not dispute the issue currently before us, we indicated our agreement with this concession, citing our prior decision in Burrell v. United States, 384 F.3d 22, 31 (2d Cir.2004), where we held that, under Connecticut law, a conviction based on an Alford plea qualified as a predicate felony \u201cconviction\u201d for the purposes of being classified as a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). See Savage, 542 F.3d at 964.\nThough Burrell does not, by itself, resolve the issue before us,6 it is nevertheless instructive. 384 F.3d at 24 n. 2. In Burrell, we held that where the fact of conviction is all that matters, id. at 27-28, under Connecticut law, \u201cthere is no distinction among Alford, nolo contendere, and standard guilty pleas in the disposition of criminal cases. All three pleas have \u2018the weight of a final adjudication of guilt\u2019 and, thus, result in judgments of conviction,\u201d id. at 29. Here, the definition of \u201cprior sentence\u201d merely requires that a sentence was imposed upon adjudication of guilt. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). Because \u201csentences under Alford pleas are no less final judgments than those imposed under standard pleas or jury verdicts,\u201d Burrell, 384 F.3d at 28, a sentence imposed following a conviction resulting from an Alford plea satisfies the Guidelines definition of \u201cprior sentence.\u201d\nC. Sister Circuits\nOur sister circuits that have addressed Banks\u2019s precise argument have uniformly rejected it. The Third and Fourth have held that \u201ca sentence imposed after an Alford plea qualifies as a \u2018prior sentence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4AI.2(a) for purposes of calculating an offender\u2019s criminal history.\u201d King, 673 F.3d at 281 (citing Mackins, 218 F.3d at 269); see also United States v. Martinez, 30 Fed.Appx. 900, 905 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A]n Alford plea is an \u2018adjudication of guilt\u2019 under \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l) and therefore can properly be counted as a prior sentence under the USSG.\u201d).\nIn King, a defendant convicted under the same statute at issue here asserted *93that \u201cthe district court erroneously added three points to his criminal history score,\u201d because the term of imprisonment he received following his Alford plea did not qualify as a \u201cprior sentence.\u201d 673 F.3d at 280. After surveying the law in other circuits \u2014 including our decisions in Savage and Abimbola \u2014 the Fourth Circuit rejected Banks\u2019s proffered statutory interpretation and held that a sentence imposed following an Alford plea qualifies as a \u201cpri- or sentence.\u201d Id. at 283.\nThe Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in MacMns. Despite acknowledging that the defendant\u2019s \u201csole motivation for pleading guilty was because the plea allowed him to be released on time served as opposed to remaining incarcerated while awaiting a trial date to be set,\u201d 218 F.3d at 266 n. 2, the court concluded that the entry of the defendant\u2019s plea still qualified as a \u201cprior sentence,\u201d id. at 268; see also Abimbola, 378 F.3d at 181 (quoting Moderns with approval). Furthermore, other circuits have held in analogous contexts that sentences resulting from Alford pleas can serve as predicate convictions for the purposes of increasing a defendant\u2019s offense level. See United States v. Vinton, 631 F.3d 476, 486-87 (8th Cir.2011) (holding that conviction entered following Alford plea was a conviction of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the offense-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3)(B)); United States v. Guerrero-Velasquez, 434 F.3d 1193, 1197-98 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that conviction following Alford plea constituted conviction of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the offense-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)).\nThe only support for the contrary conclusion is unpersuasive. While the dissent in Mackins embraced Banks\u2019s statutory interpretation, it expressly acknowledged that its conclusion was motivated by the rigidity of the pre-Booker Guidelines, which would otherwise severely restrict the district courts\u2019 ability to consider the fact that a defendant served no additional time in exchange for an Alford plea. 218 F.3d at 271-72 (Bright, J., dissenting). In light of the discretion afforded to district courts to consider such circumstances after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny, this concern need no longer detain us. See United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 189-92 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that district courts are entitled to particular deference if they choose to vary from the \u201csharply increase[d]\u201d sentences for firearms offenses under Section 2K2.1(a)).7\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, we now join our sister circuits in concluding that a sentence imposed for a conviction resulting from an Alford plea constitutes a \u201cprior sentence\u201d within the meaning of Section 4A1.2(a)(l). We therefore reject Banks\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history category or increasing his base offense level by relying on sentences resulting from Alford pleas.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n. Although the plea agreement contained an appeal waiver provision, the government \u25a0 is not seeking to enforce that waiver in light of the parties\u2019 mutually mistaken belief that Banks was subject to a 180-month mandatory minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and the erroneous advice Banks received to that effect.\n\n\n. Because the state court treated Banks as a first-time offender, his offense carried a seven-year maximum penalty. Accordingly, it did not qualify as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA, which requires a prior conviction of a drug offense carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of at least ten years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).\n\n\n. According to the PSR, Banks was arrested for the robbery on September 17, 2003, whereas he was arrested for the assault on May 4, 2004. The parties do not dispute that these offenses were separated by an intervening arrest and therefore count separately under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).\n\n\n. When determining whether a defendant has sustained \u201ctwo felony convictions of ... a crime of violence,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), courts must \"use only those felony convictions that receive criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b), or (c).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 10. Because these provisions assign criminal history points only for \"prior sentences,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4A1.2(a), a felony conviction of a crime of violence does not warrant an increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) unless it also qualifies as a \"prior sentence.\u201d\n\n\n. The INA defines \"conviction\u201d as:\n[A] formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where \u2014 (i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and (ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien\u2019s liberty to be imposed.\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A).\n\n\n. Whereas the Guidelines provide their own statutory definition for the term \"prior sentence,\u201d the statutory provision at issue in Bur-rell provides that, for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), \"[w]hat constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20); Burrell, 384 F.3d at 24 n. 2 (distinguishing Abimbola). Accordingly, the treatment of a prior offense may diverge under the two statutes. Compare Burrell, 384 F.3d at 28 (\"[A] \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction is not subject to attack on the ground that a predicate conviction is subsequently reversed, vacated or modified.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.6 (\"Sentences resulting from convictions that ... have been reversed or vacated ... are not to be counted.\u201d).\n\n\n. Furthermore, on multiple occasions, this Court has noted the authority of the district courts to \"make a so-called 'horizontal departure\u2019 \u201d and \"adopt a lower criminal history category,\u201d United States v. Preacely, 628 F.3d 72, 80 (2d Cir.2010), based on such \"individualized considerationfs]\u201d as \"the sentences previously imposed, and the amount of time previously served compared to the sentencing range called for by placement in [a particular criminal history category],\u201d Mishoe, 241 F.3d at 219; see also United States v. Ingram, 721 F.3d 35, 39 (2d Cir.2013) (Calabresi, J., concurring).\n\n",
