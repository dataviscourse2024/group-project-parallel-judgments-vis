BOATSWAIN\u2019S SECOND MOTION\n                   FOR MODIFICATION/REDUCTION OF SENTENCE\n\n          This 2nd day of November, 2022, upon consideration of the Motion for\n\nModification/Reduction of Sentence (the \u201cSecond Rule 35 Motion\u201d) filed by Roger R.\n\nBoatswain; the exhibits attached to the Rule 35 Motion; Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure (\u201cCriminal Rule 35\u201d); the facts, arguments and legal authorities set forth in\n\nthe Second Rule 35 Motion; and the entire record in this case:\n\n                                                BACKGROUND\n\n          1.       On July 1, 2004, a jury found Mr. Boatswain guilty of Robbery in the First\n\nDegree, Possession of Deadly Weapon By a Person Prohibited, and two counts of Possession of\n\na Deadly Weapon During the Commission of a Felony.1 The Court sentenced Mr. Boatswain on\n\nSeptember 3, 2004.2 The Supreme Court affirmed Mr. Boatswain\u2019s convictions on direct\n\nappeal.3\n\n          2.       Subsequently, April 7, 2008, Mr. Boatswain sought relief under Criminal Rule 61\n\n(the \u201cRule 61 Motion\u201d), arguing ineffective assistance of counsel.4 The Court summarily denied\n\n\n1\n    D.I. No. 16.\n2\n    D.I. No. 30.\n3\n    Boatswain v. State, 872 A.2d 959 (Del. 2005).\n4\n    D.I. No. 40.\n\fthe Rule 61 Motion.5 The Supreme Court then summarily dismissed the appeal of the Rule 61\n\nMotion.6\n\n        3.       Mr. Boatswain first sought relief under Criminal Rule 35 in 2004 (the \u201cFirst Rule\n\n35 Motion\u201d).7 Mr. Boatswain signed the First Rule 35 Motion on November 23, 2004.8 The\n\nProthonotary received the First Rule 35 Motion on November 29, 2004 and docketed that motion\n\non December 16, 2004.9\n\n        4.       The First Rule 35 Motion asserted one basis for relief\u2014\u201cMaintains[] of\n\ninnocence.\u201d10 Mr. Boatswain provided two supporting facts: (i) insufficient evidence; and (ii)\n\nineffective assistance of counsel. However, Mr. Boatswain failed to expand his position with\n\nany specific facts, affidavits or exhibits. Mr. Boatswain argued that his sentence should be\n\nmodified to \u201c0\u201d years of incarceration. The Court denied the First Rule 35 Motion on December\n\n27, 2004.11 The Court denied the First Rule 35 Motion for being untimely, seeking modification\n\nof mandatory sentences, and that the sentence was appropriate for all the reasons stated at the\n\ntime of sentencing.12 Mr. Boatswain did not appeal.\n\n                                      SECOND RULE 35 MOTION\n\n        5.       Mr. Boatswain filed the Second Rule 35 Motion on October 14, 2022. In support\n\nof sentence modification, Mr. Boatswain makes two basic arguments. First, Mr. Boatswain\n\ncontends that the Second Rule 35 Motion should be considered timely because the Court erred\n\nwhen it held that the First Rule 35 Motion was untimely. Mr. Boatswain makes a \u201crelation\n\n\n5\n   State v. Boatswain, 2008 WL 1724255 (Del. Super. April 8, 2008).\n6\n   Boatswain v. State, 962 A.2d 256 (Del. 2008)(Table).\n7\n   D.I. No. 31.\n8\n   Id.\n9\n   Id.\n10\n    Id.\n11\n    D.I. No. 32.\n12\n    Id.\n\n                                                        2\n\fback\u201d type argument based on error. As such, Mr. Boatswain seems to contend the Second Rule\n\n35 Motion is not subject to Criminal Rule 35\u2019s procedural bars. Second, Mr. Boatswain\n\ncontends \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exist because the Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d)\n\nwrongfully refuses to file a petition with the Court to modify his sentence under 11 Del. C. \u00a7\n\n4217 (\u201cSection 4217\u201d).\n\n                                                DISCUSSION\n\n        6.       Pursuant to Criminal Rule 35(b), the Court may reduce a sentence of\n\nimprisonment on a motion made within 90 days after the sentence is imposed.13 The intent of\n\nCriminal Rule 35(b) has historically been to provide a reasonable period for the Court to\n\nconsider alteration of its sentencing judgments.14 Under Criminal Rule 35(b), the Court has\n\nbroad discretion to decide if it should alter its judgment when a motion for reduction of sentence\n\nis filed within 90 days of sentencing.15 \u201cThe reason for such a rule is to give a sentencing judge\n\na second chance to consider whether the initial sentence is appropriate.\u201d16\n\n        7.       The Court sentenced Mr. Boatswain on September 3, 2004. Mr. Boatswain filed\n\nthe Second Rule 35 Motion on October 14, 2022. Mr. Boatswain filed the Second Rule 35\n\nMotion more than 90 days after imposition of the sentence and is, therefore, time barred.\n\n        8.       By use of the docket, Mr. Boatswain demonstrates that the First Rule 35 Motion\n\nwas timely filed. Mr. Boatswain then makes a form of relation back argument, contending that\n\nthe Second Rule 35 Motion is, in essence, a timely first motion. Mr. Boatswain\u2019s argument\n\n\n13\n   Super. Ct. Crim. R. 35(b); see also State v. Culp, No. 249, 2016, 2016 WL 7176720, at *2 (Del. Dec. 8, 2016).\n14\n   Johnson v. State, 234 A.2d 447, 448 (Del. 1967)(per curiam).\n15\n   Hewett v. State, 2014 WL 5020251, at *1 (Del. Oct. 7, 2014)(\u201cWhen, as here, a motion for reduction of sentence\nis filed within ninety days of sentencing, the Superior Court has broad discretion to decide whether to alter its\njudgment.\u201d)\n16\n   State v. Reed, 2014 WL 7148921, at *2 (Del. Super. Dec. 16, 2014)(citing United States v. Ellenbogen, 390 F.2d\n537, 541-43 (2d. Cir. 1968)(explaining the time limitation and purpose of then-extant sentence reduction provision\nof Fed. R. Crim. P. 35, the federal analogue to current Criminal Rule 35(b)).\n\n                                                         3\n\fignores that: (i) Mr. Boatswain failed to appeal the Court\u2019s ruling; and (ii) the Court did not deny\n\nthe First Rule 35 Motion only because it was untimely.\n\n         9.       Mr. Boatswain could have appealed the Court\u2019s decision on the First Rule 35\n\nMotion if he felt there was error. Mr. Boatswain appealed other matters in this criminal case\u2014a\n\ndirect appeal of his conviction and the summary denial of his Criminal Rule 61 Motion. In\n\naddition, the Court did not deny the First Rule 35 Motion merely because it was untimely. The\n\nCourt also denied the First Rule 35 Motion as it sought modification of mandatory sentences and\n\nbecause the Court, exercising its discretion, felt the sentence was appropriate.17 Under these\n\ncircumstances, the Court will not ignore the dictates of Criminal Rule 35(b)18 and deem the\n\nSecond Rule 35 Motion as timely or as a supplement to the First Rule 35 Motion.\n\n         10.      The Court will consider an application made more than 90 days after the\n\nimposition of sentence only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d or pursuant to Section 4217.19 In\n\norder to \u201cuphold the finality of sentences,\u201d Delaware law places a heavy burden on the moving\n\nparty to establish extraordinary circumstances.20 In State v. Diaz, the Supreme Court held that\n\n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d are those types of circumstances that \u201cspecifically justify the\n\ndelay;\u2019 are \u2018entirely beyond a petitioner\u2019s control;\u2019 and \u2018have prevented the applicant from\n\n\n17\n   The First Rule 35 Motion did not state valid reasons for modification under Criminal Rule 35. Mr. Boatswains\narguments regarding actual innocence based on lack of evidence or ineffective counsel should and could have been\ndealt with on direct appeal on under Criminal Rule 61.\n18\n   Criminal Rule 35 requires that motions to reduce or modify a sentence be filed within 90-days of sentencing and\nthat the Court will not consider repetitive requests to modify or reduce a sentence. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 35(b).\n19\n   Section 4217 permits the Superior Court to modify a sentence solely on the basis of an application filed by the\nDepartment of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d) \u201cfor good cause shown which certifies that the release of the defendant shall not\nconstitute a substantial risk to the community or the defendant\u2019s own self.\u201d 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217(b). Good cause\nincludes, but is not limited to, \u201crehabilitation of the offender, serious medical illness or infirmity of the offender and\nprison overcrowding.\u201d 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217(c). For purposes of Section 4217, \u201crehabilitation\u201d is defined as \u201cthe\nprocess of restoring an individual to a useful and constructive place in society especially through some form of\nvocational, correctional, or therapeutic retraining.\u201d 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217(h). Such applications by the DOC \u201cshall be\nfiled with the Board of Parole.\u201d 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217(d)(1).\n20\n   Johnson, 2006 WL 3872849, at *3; see also State v. Diaz, 113 A.3d 1081 (table), 2015 WL 1741768, at *2-3 (Del.\n2015).\n\n                                                            4\n\fseeking the remedy on a timely basis.\u2019\u201d21 Mitigating factors that could have been presented at\n\nsentencing, exemplary conduct or successful rehabilitation while incarcerated do not constitute\n\n\u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d22\n\n        11.      The Rule 35 Motion was not filed under Section 4217. Moreover, the Court has\n\nreviewed the basis of relief set out in the Rule 35 Motion, and the Court does not find the\n\nexistence of any extraordinary circumstances.\n\n        12.      Mr. Boatswain contends that DOC will not file an application under Section 4217\n\neven though Mr. Boatswain has gotten favorable rulings by certain internal review panels (e.g.,\n\nhe DOC MDT Classification Board). Mr. Boatswain contends that DOC is not correctly or\n\nimpartially processing Mr. Boatswain\u2019s Section 4217 request. Mr. Boatswain wants the Court\n\nto undertake its own analysis of his case under Section 4217 because Mr. Boatswain contends\n\nthat DOC is arbitrarily refusing to seek modification under that section with the Court. Mr.\n\nBoatswain contends that this constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting consideration\n\nof the Second Rule 35 Motion.\n\n        13.      The Court refuses Mr. Boatswain\u2019s invitation to take on the role of DOC and the\n\nBoard of Parole under Section 4217. Section 4217 expressly establishes a process under which\n\nDOC and the Board of Parole can file an application with the Court that seeks modification of a\n\nsentence. This process makes sense. Those institutions are better positioned than the Court to\n\nanalyze whether Mr. Boatswain has been rehabilitated, has a serious medical illness or infirmity,\n\n\n\n21\n  Diaz, 2015 WL 1741768, at *2-3; see also State v. Lewis, 797 A.2d 1198, 1205 (Del. 2002)(Steele, J., dissenting).\n22\n  State v. Liket, 2002 WL 31133101 (Del. Super. Sept. 25, 2002)(exemplary conduct or successful rehabilitation\nduring incarceration does not qualify as extraordinary circumstances and relief for such achievements is more\nproperly addressed to the parole board); see also United States v. LaMorte, 940 F. Supp. 572, 578 (S.D.N.Y. 1996);\nUnited States v. Arcaro, No. 89 Cr. 001, 1992 WL 73366, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. April 1, 1992)(Court stated that \u201c[w]hile\ndefendant\u2019s educational endeavors in prison and his diligent performance of prison job assignments are laudable\naccomplishments, they do not justify a reduction in sentence.\u201d).\n\n                                                        5\n\for that there is prison overcrowding.23 In addition, DOC and the Board of Parole are better\n\nsituated than the Court to make the certification that Mr. Boatswain \u201cshall not constitute a\n\nsubstantial risk to the community or [Mr. Boatswain\u2019s] own self.\u201d24\n\n         14.      Criminal Rule 35(b) provides that \u201c[t]he court will not consider repetitive requests\n\nfor reduction of sentence.\u201d25 Unlike the 90-day jurisdictional limit with its \u201cextraordinary\n\ncircumstances\u201d exception, the bar to repetitive motions has no exception. Instead, this bar is\n\nabsolute and flatly \u201cprohibits repetitive requests for reduction of sentence.\u201d26 A motion is\n\nrepetitive, as used in Criminal Rule 35(b), \u201c\u2026when it is preceded by an earlier Rule 35(b)\n\nmotion, even if the subsequent motion raises new arguments.\u201d27 Criminal Rule 35(b) does not\n\nset out any exception to repetitive motion procedural bar.\n\n         15.      The Second Rule 35 Motion is Mr. Boatswain\u2019s second motion under Criminal\n\nRule 35(b). Mr. Boatswain argues that the Second Rule 35 Motion is his first motion because\n\nthe Court erred in finding the First Rule 35 Motion was untimely. As discussed above, if the\n\nCourt erred, Mr. Boatswain should have appealed the decision. Mr. Boatswain did not appeal.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Boatswain fails to acknowledge that the Court made alternative rulings when\n\ndenying the First Rule 35 Motion. As such, the Court finds the Second Rule 35 Motion is a\n\nrepetitive request under Criminal Rule 35(b). Criminal Rule 35(b) therefore applies to\n\nprocedurally bar the Second Rule 35 Motion.\n\n\n23\n   11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217(c).\n24\n   11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217(b).\n25\n   Super. Ct. Crim.

No additional information has been provided to the Court that would warrant a\n\nreduction or modification of this sentence.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, this Court finds that Mr. Boatswain has\n\nnot demonstrated cause for the relief sought in the Second Rule 35 Motion.\n\n       IT IS ORDERED that Roger R.
