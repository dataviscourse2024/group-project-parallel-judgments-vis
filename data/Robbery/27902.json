Raymond\n Sun, Deputy State\u2019s Attorneys, Rutland, for Plaintiff-Appellee.\n\nMatthew Valerio, Defender General, Joshua S. O\u2019Hara, Appellate Defender, Montpelier, and\n Roy H. Kuhlmann, Pro Se, Newport, for Defendant-Appellant.\n\n\nPRESENT: Reiber, C.J., Robinson, Eaton, Carroll and Cohen, JJ.\n\n\n        \u00b6 1.   EATON, J. Defendant appeals his convictions by a jury of unlawful trespass of\n\nan occupied dwelling, obstruction of justice, and unlawful restraint. The unlawful-trespass and\n\nobstruction-of-justice charges were based on defendant\u2019s acts of entering complainant\u2019s residence,\n\nhiding under her bed to listen to her telephone calls, emerging from under the bed and frightening\n\nher, and then, when the state police later arrived, urging her to tell them that nothing was wrong.\n\nDefendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for trespassing\n\nbecause he had permission to enter the complainant\u2019s house. He claims that his statements in the\n\npresence of police were not threatening and were therefore insufficient to support the obstruction-\n\nof-justice charge. Finally, defendant challenges his conviction for unlawful restraint, which was\n\fbased on an altercation that took place three months earlier during which he pushed the\n\ncomplainant onto her bed and held her down for five minutes. He contends that the restraint was\n\nmerely incidental to the assault that preceded it and cannot support a separate conviction. We\n\naffirm the unlawful-restraint conviction, but reverse defendant\u2019s convictions for unlawful trespass\n\nand obstruction of justice because we agree that they are not supported by the record.\n\n       \u00b6 2.    The State presented the following evidence at trial. Defendant and the complainant\n\nmet through an online dating website in the spring of 2017. The complainant lived in Ira, Vermont,\n\nand defendant lived in upstate New York. During the early part of their relationship, the\n\ncomplainant traveled to New York to spend weekends with defendant. Later, she would travel to\n\nNew York and bring defendant back to Vermont to stay in her home for several days at a time.\n\n       \u00b6 3.    The complainant testified that as their relationship progressed, defendant became\n\njealous and controlling. He told her that he had been cheated on before, that he had done \u201cbad\n\nstuff\u201d to his former girlfriends like \u201cslapp[ing] them around\u201d and pointing a gun at one of them,\n\nand that if he ever found her with someone, he would kill her and that person. In November 2017,\n\nwhile defendant was staying at the complainant\u2019s house, the two had an argument after the\n\ncomplainant noticed that defendant was talking to an ex-girlfriend. Defendant became upset and\n\nshoved the complainant down onto a bed. He then climbed on top of her and held her down on\n\nthe bed for five minutes. While he was holding her down, he was yelling so loudly that spit came\n\nout of his mouth. When he eventually released her, she rolled off the bed, and he struck her hard\n\non her buttocks. She testified she had handprint bruises on her forearms as a result of defendant\n\npinning her to the bed, and that her buttocks hurt for several weeks afterward. The complainant\n\ndrove defendant back to New York the next day. She obtained a relief-from-abuse order against\n\ndefendant, which she later agreed to have dismissed.\n\n       \u00b6 4.    Defendant subsequently apologized to the complainant and told her that he was\n\nseeking counseling. She agreed to resume their relationship. Defendant began staying at her house\n\n                                                2\n\ffor multiple nights in a row. He typically remained in the house while the complainant was at work\n\nand had access to everything in the house. He did not have his own key to her house, but she\n\nallowed him to use a key that she kept on the headboard so he could get back in when he hitchhiked\n\nto the store. She testified that he did not have permission to go into her house without her\n\nknowledge. The complainant admitted during cross-examination that defendant came and went as\n\nhe pleased when he stayed at her house, using the key to gain entry. She agreed that defendant\n\nhad permission to be at her house when she was not there.\n\n       \u00b6 5.    On February 22, 2018, the complainant dropped defendant off at the local Jiffy\n\nMart on her way to work, with the understanding that he planned to hitchhike back to her house.\n\nHe had been staying with her for about a week and had the key that she kept on her headboard in\n\nhis possession. Around noon, however, defendant sent the complainant a text message stating that\n\nhe was hitchhiking back to New York. He continued to text her throughout the day regarding his\n\nostensible progress, finally stating that he was back at his camper and planned to go to sleep.\n\n       \u00b6 6.    The complainant returned home after work that evening and entered the house,\n\nwhich was locked. She found a note on her bed from defendant stating that he had done the\n\nlaundry, brought in wood, and left the key on the headboard. She sat on the bed and made some\n\nphone calls. After she hung up, defendant came out from underneath her bed. The complainant\n\nwas terrified and ran toward the door. Defendant told her, \u201cit\u2019s me,\u201d and the complainant stopped\n\nrunning. She asked him why he was hiding under the bed. He told her that he needed to see if she\n\nwas going to bring someone else home after work. She called her daughter, who called the police.\n\n       \u00b6 7.    The complainant testified that when the police arrived, defendant asked her to not\n\nopen the door. She did so anyway, and defendant hid behind the door. The complainant indicated\n\nwhere he was to the police and ran outside. Defendant then came out and spoke with one of the\n\nofficers. The complainant stated that defendant said to her, \u201cTell the troopers that nothing\u2019s going\n\non, everything\u2019s okay. He loved me, not to do this, why was I doing this to him.\u201d The troopers\n\n                                                 3\n\fsubsequently arrested defendant and he was charged with unlawful trespass of an occupied\n\ndwelling, obstruction of justice, unlawful restraint, and three counts of domestic assault\u2014two for\n\npushing the complainant down on the bed and striking her buttocks in November 2017, and a third\n\nfor putting her in fear of imminent serious bodily injury by emerging from under the bed in\n\nFebruary 2018.\n\n       \u00b6 8.    After the State presented testimony from the complainant, her children, and the\n\nresponding officers, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on the unlawful-trespass and\n\nobstruction-of-justice charges.1 The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant then\n\ntestified. He said that he had caught the complainant sharing nude photos with other men on her\n\niPad. He asked her to stop. He testified that he held the complainant on the bed in November\n\n2017 because she had punched him in the chest, and that \u201cit wasn\u2019t . . . as bad as it sounded.\u201d\n\nRegarding the February 2018 incident, he explained that he believed the complainant was cheating\n\non him and came up with the plan to hide under the bed so he could figure out who it was. He\n\ndenied hurting women or that he had pointed a gun at an ex-girlfriend.\n\n       \u00b6 9.    The jury found defendant guilty of all the charges except for the domestic-assault\n\ncharge that was based on his allegedly hitting the complainant\u2019s buttocks in November 2017. The\n\ncourt subsequently sentenced defendant to serve, concurrently, two-and-a-half-to-three years for\n\nunlawful trespass, two-and-a-half-to-four years for obstruction of justice, and fifteen-to-eighteen\n\nmonths for the February 2018 domestic assault. It also sentenced defendant to serve, concurrently,\n\nfifteen-to-eighteen months for the November 2017 domestic assault and two-and-a-half-to-four\n\nyears for unlawful restraint. It ordered that the two sets of sentences be served consecutively to\n\neach other, resulting in an aggregate sentence of five-to-eight years to serve. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Prior to trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the unlawful-restraint charge.\nHe did not renew this motion at trial.\n                                                4\n\f                                      I. Unlawful Trespass\n\n       \u00b6 10.   On appeal, defendant first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal on the unlawful-trespass charge because there was insufficient evidence to\n\nshow that defendant knew he did not have permission to enter the dwelling. We agree that the\n\nrecord does not support this conviction, and reverse.\n\n       \u00b6 11.   Defendant was charged with violating 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3705(d), which provides: \u201cA\n\nperson who enters a dwelling house, whether or not a person is actually present, knowing that he\n\nor she is not licensed or privileged to do so shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or\n\nfined not more than $2,000.00, or both.\u201d Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal after the\n\nState finished presenting its evidence, arguing that the record showed he had permission to enter\n\nthe dwelling. The State admitted that defendant had permission to be in the complainant\u2019s home\n\nat times, but argued that by communicating to the complainant that he had left for New York,\n\ndefendant \u201cknew his license or privilege to be in the home had ended.\u201d The trial court noted that\n\nthe statute criminalizes entry into a dwelling, not remaining. However, it concluded that the jury\n\ncould reasonably find that defendant did not have permission to enter the home for the purpose of\n\nhiding under the complainant\u2019s bed.\n\n       \u00b6 12.   When reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we examine\n\n\u201cwhether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State and excluding any\n\nmodifying evidence, fairly and reasonably tends to convince a reasonable trier of fact that the\n\ndefendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Delisle, 162 Vt. 293, 307, 648 A.2d 632,\n\n641 (1994) (quotation and alterations omitted). Because the jury is best positioned to weigh the\n\nfacts, the court should grant a judgment of acquittal \u201conly when there is no evidence to support a\n\nguilty verdict.\u201d State v. Cameron, 2016 VT 134, \u00b6 5, 204 Vt. 52, 163 A.3d 545. The issue before\n\nus therefore is \u201cwhether sufficient evidence was disclosed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fdefendant entered [the complainant\u2019s] residence knowing that he was not licensed or privileged to\n\ndo so.\u201d State v. Fanger, 164 Vt. 48, 51-52, 665 A.2d 36, 37 (1995) (emphasis omitted).\n\n       \u00b6 13.   In State v. Fanger, we explained that the knowledge requirement in \u00a7 3705(d) is a\n\nsubjective standard that \u201cexcludes from criminal liability both the inadvertent trespasser and the\n\ntrespasser who believes that he has received express or implied permission to enter or remain on\n\nthe premises.\u201d Id. at 52, 665 A.2d at 38. Thus, \u201c[i]t is not sufficient for the State to show that\n\ndefendant should have known he was not licensed or privileged to enter the dwelling.\u201d Id. In\n\nFanger, we held that there was sufficient evidence to support a property manager\u2019s unlawful-\n\ntrespass conviction after he forced his way into a tenant\u2019s apartment for the purpose of evicting\n\nher and her husband. Id. at 53-54, 665 A.2d at 38-39. The property manager told the police that\n\nhe believed he had the right to enter the apartment to make sure the heat was on in that apartment\n\nand other apartments in the building. We stated that because the knowledge element of trespass\n\nwas subjective, his ignorance of the law could be a defense. Id. at 53, 665 A.2d at 38. However,\n\nthe tenant testified that the property manager\u2019s only acts upon entering were to disconnect the heat,\n\nelectricity, and hot water in the apartment where she was staying, and that he said nothing about\n\nprotecting the other apartments and made clear he was there to evict her. This inconsistency, along\n\nwith the violent manner in which the property manager entered the apartment, created a reasonable\n\ninference that he knew he lacked permission to enter. Id. at 53-54, 665 A.2d at 38-39.\n\n       \u00b6 14.   The facts of this case differ significantly from Fanger. As the State conceded\n\nbelow, defendant generally had permission to be in the complainant\u2019s house when she was not\n\nthere. At the time of the February incident, he had been staying with her for about a week, using\n\nher key to enter and exit the house when she was away at work. Although the complainant testified\n\nthat defendant did not have permission to go into the house without her knowledge, the evidence\n\nshowed that defendant knew he had permission to enter the house on the day in question.\n\nSpecifically, the complainant testified that she dropped defendant off at the Jiffy Mart with the\n\n                                                 6\n\fexpectation that he would hitchhike back to her house and use her spare key to get inside. She\n\nagreed that if she had come home and he had been making dinner, it would have been a normal\n\nday. There is no dispute that when the complainant dropped him off, defendant would have\n\nunderstood that he had permission to return and enter her home.\n\n       \u00b6 15.   The State argues on appeal that defendant only had conditional permission to be in\n\nthe house and that his conscious misrepresentation about his purpose for being in the house\n\nrendered the permission ineffective. According to the State, the jury could have inferred from the\n\nmessages defendant sent to the complainant over the course of the day and the complainant\u2019s\n\ntestimony regarding defendant\u2019s jealousy and suspicion of her infidelity that defendant had\n\nformulated his plan to hide under her bed at the time he entered the house. The State argues that\n\nthe jury could infer that, even if defendant had permission to be in the complainant\u2019s home, he\n\nknew he did not have permission to be there for the purpose of hiding under her bed and frightening\n\nher.\n\n       \u00b6 16.   The State\u2019s argument is based on the Restatement of Torts, which states that \u201c[a]\n\nconditional or restricted consent to enter land creates a privilege to do so only in so far as the\n\ncondition or restriction is complied with.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 168 (1965). The\n\nRestatement also provides that consent induced by a conscious misrepresentation regarding the\n\npurpose for which admittance to land is sought is not effective. See id. \u00a7 892B (consent induced\n\nby misrepresentation not effective); id. \u00a7 173 cmt. b (\u201cA conscious misrepresentation as to the\n\npurpose for which admittance to the land is sought, may be a fraudulent misrepresentation of a\n\nmaterial fact.\u201d). The State urges us to adopt the Restatement approach in the context of our\n\ncriminal-trespass statute.\n\n       \u00b6 17.   We need not decide whether the cited tort principles apply to the criminal-trespass\n\nstatute because even if they did, the evidence does not support the State\u2019s theory. First, although\n\nthe complainant testified that defendant did not have permission to be in the house without her\n\n                                                7\n\fknowledge, there is no evidence that she conditioned or restricted her consent for defendant to\n\nenter the house on February 22 or any other day. Rather, the evidence was that she left him at the\n\nstore with her key so he could return to the house. The complainant testified that defendant\n\ntypically stayed at her house while she was at work and had access to everything in the house.\n\nThere was no evidence that she gave him permission to be in the house only for a specific purpose,\n\nas one might for a delivery person or a plumber.\n\n       \u00b6 18.   The trial court ruled that the jury could find that defendant had permission to enter\n\nthe complainant\u2019s house, but not for the purpose of deceiving the complainant regarding his\n\ncontinued presence there, and that his deceitful intent at the time of entry vitiated her consent. This\n\ntheory relies on the assumption that the complainant would not have consented to defendant\u2019s\n\npresence under these circumstances. Absent any testimony to support that assumption, this theory\n\nis too attenuated to support the trespassing conviction.\n\n       \u00b6 19.   The State\u2019s theory also fails because, as it conceded below, it is not possible to tell\n\nfrom the evidence precisely when defendant entered the house or formulated his ruse. In other\n\nwords, there is nothing to show that defendant consciously misrepresented to the complainant his\n\npurpose for entering the house. Although the State argues that defendant was suspicious and\n\njealous throughout his relationship with the complainant, this is an insufficient basis for the jury\n\nto infer that at the time defendant entered the house, he knew he did not have permission to be\n\nthere. It is entirely possible that he came up with his plan after he entered, while he was doing\n\nlaundry and stacking wood for the complainant. This case is therefore unlike Fanger, in which the\n\ndefendant\u2019s contemporaneous statements to the tenant and forcible entry created a reasonable\n\ninference that he knew he was entering without permission. 164 Vt. at 53-54, 665 A.2d at 38-39.\n\n       \u00b6 20.   Moreover, even assuming that defendant\u2019s subsequent misrepresentations about his\n\nwhereabouts effectively revoked the complainant\u2019s consent to his presence in the house, as the\n\nState suggested below, our unlawful-trespass statute does not criminalize remaining in a house\n\n                                                  8\n\fwithout permission\u2014only entry. See 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3705(d) (\u201cA person who enters a dwelling\n\nhouse, whether or not a person is actually present, knowing that he or she is not licensed or\n\nprivileged to do so shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or fined not more than\n\n$2,000.00, or both.\u201d).2 Without evidence that defendant subjectively knew at the time he entered\n\nthe house that he did not have permission to be there, the State cannot support the conviction and\n\nit must be reversed.\n\n                                    II. Obstruction of Justice\n\n       \u00b6 21.   We turn next to defendant\u2019s claim that he was wrongfully convicted of obstruction\n\nof justice. Defendant was charged with violating 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3015, which provides in relevant\n\npart: \u201cWhoever . . . corruptly or by threats or force or by any threatening letter or communication,\n\nobstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice, shall be\n\nimprisoned not more than five years or fined not more than $5,000.00, or both.\u201d Specifically, the\n\nState charged that defendant endeavored by threatening communication to obstruct the due\n\nadministration of justice when he told the complainant to tell the troopers that nothing was wrong.\n\n       \u00b6 22.   Defendant\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that his statements to the complainant\n\ndid not constitute a \u201ctrue threat,\u201d as that term has been defined in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s First\n\nAmendment jurisprudence, and therefore cannot be punished without violating his right to freedom\n\nof speech. Defendant also contends, as he did below, that the statements were not threats at all.\n\nWe agree with the latter argument and reverse on that basis.3\n\n\n       2\n          A separate provision of the statute makes it a crime to remain on land after receiving\nactual notice against trespass. See 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3705(a). The trial court properly rejected the\nState\u2019s request to instruct the jury that \u00a7 3705(a) was a lesser included offense of \u00a7 3705(d),\nbecause the two crimes have different elements. The State conceded below that the evidence did\nnot support a charge under \u00a7 3705(a).\n       3\n           Our agreement with defendant\u2019s contention that his words were not threatening should\nnot be construed as agreement with defendant\u2019s broader claim that 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3015 only applies\nto \u201ctrue threats\u201d as defined in the First Amendment context. Cf. State v. Ashley, 161 Vt. 65, 71-\n72, 632 A.2d 1368, 1372 (1993) (affirming obstruction-of-justice conviction based on defendant\u2019s\nthreat to reveal information that would harm witness\u2019s reputation and could result in her losing\n                                                9\n\f        \u00b6 23.   The complainant testified that defendant said to her, \u201cTell the troopers that\n\nnothing\u2019s going on, everything\u2019s okay. He loved me, not to do this, why was I doing this to him.\u201d\n\nNo rational trier of fact could find that these statements constituted threatening communications,\n\nbecause they conveyed no explicit or implicit threat of harm. Cf. United States v. Jackson, 974\n\nF.2d 104, 106 (9th Cir. 1992) (\u201cWhere a defendant\u2019s statements can be reasonably construed as a\n\nthreat, even if they are not made directly to the threatened person, the defendant has obstructed\n\njustice.\u201d).\n\n        \u00b6 24.   In construing \u00a7 3015, our goal is to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed\n\nin the plain, ordinary meaning of the statutory language. See State v. Blake, 2017 VT 68, \u00b6 8, 205\n\nVt. 265, 174 A.3d 126.        Defendant was charged with endeavoring to obstruct justice by\n\n\u201cthreatening communication.\u201d 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3015. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a threat as \u201c[a]\n\ncommunicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another or on another\u2019s property.\u201d Threat, Black\u2019s\n\nLaw Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). Similarly, Merriam-Webster defines threat as \u201can expression of\n\nintention to inflict evil, injury, or damage.\u201d      Threat, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary,\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/threat [https://perma.cc/E5NV-86VC].               These\n\ndefinitions make clear that while the allegedly threatening communication does not have to involve\n\nphysical force, it must express, either explicitly or implicitly, an intent to inflict harm. The harm\n\nmay be physical violence or some other form of retribution. For example, we have affirmed a\n\nconviction for obstruction of justice based on a defendant\u2019s threats to a witness that if his case\n\nwent to trial, he would disclose information that would cause her to lose custody of her daughter.\n\nState v. Wiley, 2007 VT 13, \u00b6 15, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501; see also State v. Ashley, 161 Vt. 65,\n\n\n\n\ncustody of her daughter, even though statements did not promise physical harm or force). Because\nwe do not need to define what communications may be punished as obstruction of justice under\nthe First Amendment to resolve defendant\u2019s appeal, we leave that issue to be decided in a more\nappropriate case.\n                                               10\n\f72, 632 A.2d 1368, 1372 (1993) (affirming obstruction-of-justice conviction based on similar\n\nfacts).\n\n          \u00b6 25.   In this case, however, defendant\u2019s comments cannot reasonably be viewed as\n\nthreatening, because they expressed no overt or implied intention to cause harm to defendant or\n\nanyone else. Although the complainant testified when prompted by the State\u2019s attorney that she\n\nfelt threatened by defendant\u2019s request for her to tell the police everything was fine, she did not\n\nexplain why she interpreted these objectively neutral words to be a threat. Later, she agreed that\n\ndefendant had not threatened or harmed her that evening. While we recognize that seemingly\n\nneutral words can imply threats, there was simply not enough evidence here for the jury to infer\n\nthat defendant\u2019s statement implied an intent to cause harm. Cf. United States v. Bagdasarian, 652\n\nF.3d 1113, 1119 (9th Cir. 2011) (reversing conviction under statute prohibiting threats to kill or\n\ninjure major presidential candidates because defendant\u2019s statements on internet message board that\n\nthen-presidential-candidate Obama \u201cwill have a 50 cal in the head soon,\u201d and urging others to\n\n\u201cshoot the [n-word],\u201d conveyed no explicit or implicit threat that defendant intended to harm\n\nObama). The court therefore erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the\n\nobstruction-of-justice charge. 4\n\n                                        III. Unlawful Restraint\n\n          \u00b6 26.   Finally, defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to acquit him of the\n\ncharge of unlawful restraint because the State did not establish that his act of holding the\n\ncomplainant down on the bed for five minutes during their November 2017 altercation was a\n\n\n\n          4\n          Defendant also argues that the State failed to prove that he had the requisite mental state\nto obstruct justice because his words did not have the capacity of obstructing justice. In State v.\nFucci, we declined to clarify the definition of the mental state required for this offense and left the\nissue to be addressed in a more appropriate future case. See 2015 VT 39, \u00b6 10, 198 Vt. 482, 117\nA.3d 419 (explaining that \u201ccorruptly endeavor\u201d is culpable state of mind for offense, but declining\nto further define term because defendant\u2019s admissions satisfied mens rea under any possible\nstandard). Likewise, because we conclude that defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed on the\nbasis that his statements were not threatening, we do not address the mens rea issue here.\n                                                  11\n\fseparate offense from the act of pushing her down on the bed. Defendant did not move for\n\njudgment of acquittal on this ground at trial or in a post-trial motion, and therefore we review for\n\nplain error. \u201cPlain error exists only in exceptional circumstances where a failure to recognize error\n\nwould result in a miscarriage of justice, or where there is glaring error so grave and serious that it\n\nstrikes at the very heart of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d State v. Pelican, 160 Vt. 536,\n\n538, 632 A.2d 24, 26 (1993) (quotation omitted). To reverse for plain error, we must determine\n\nthat there is an error, the error is obvious, and the error affects substantial rights and results in\n\nprejudice to defendant. State v. Yoh, 2006 VT 49A, \u00b6 39, 180 Vt. 317, 910 A.2d 853.\n\n       \u00b6 27.   In addressing defendant\u2019s claim, \u201cwe are mindful not only of the plain error\n\nstandard, but also the standard applied to claims that the trial court erred by failing to sua sponte\n\nmove for acquittal on its own motion under V.R.Cr.P. 29(a).\u201d State v. Erwin, 2011 VT 41, \u00b6 17,\n\n189 Vt. 502, 26 A.3d 1. That is, \u201ca court should move for acquittal only when the record reveals\n\nthat the evidence is so tenuous that a conviction would be unconscionable.\u201d Id. (quotation\n\nomitted). The record here does not meet either standard.\n\n       \u00b6 28.   Defendant was charged with knowingly restraining the complainant. See 13 V.S.A.\n\n\u00a7 2406(a)(3) (\u201cA person commits the crime of unlawful restraint in the second degree if the person\n\n. . . knowingly restrains another person.\u201d). Restrain \u201cmeans to restrict substantially the movement\n\nof another person without the person\u2019s consent or other lawful authority by,\u201d among other things,\n\n\u201cconfining the restrained person for a substantial period.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2404(3)(C).\n\n       \u00b6 29.   We have held that the test for determining whether a restraint may be charged as a\n\nseparate offense is \u201c \u2018whether the confinement, movement, or detention was merely incidental to\n\nthe accompanying felony or whether it was significant enough, in and of itself, to warrant\n\nindependent prosecution.\u2019 \u201d State v. Synnott, 2005 VT 19, \u00b6 19, 178 Vt. 66, 872 A.2d 874 (quoting\n\nState v. Goodhue, 2003 VT 85, \u00b6 16, 175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861). We consider several factors in\n\napplying this test, including:\n\n                                                 12\n\f               [W]hether evidence of the seizure, detention, or movement was or\n               was not inherent in the nature of the underlying crimes; whether the\n               crime was facilitated by the confinement; whether the movement or\n               confinement prevented the victim from summoning assistance;\n               whether the movement or detention lessened the defendant\u2019s risk of\n               detection; and whether the movement or detention created a\n               significant danger or increased the victim\u2019s risk of harm.\n\nGoodhue, 2003 VT 85, \u00b6 13. This inquiry is designed \u201c \u2018to prevent gross distortion of lesser crimes\n\ninto a much more serious crime by excess of prosecutorial zeal.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 12 (quoting People v.\n\nMiles, 245 N.E.2d 688, 695 (N.Y. 1969)).\n\n       \u00b6 30.   In this case, the evidence was that defendant pushed the complainant down, then\n\npinned her to the bed for five minutes while he yelled at her. He was charged with assault for\n\npushing her down, and unlawful restraint for holding her on the bed. The confinement lasted\n\nsignificantly longer than the brief period of restraint arising from the assault of pushing the\n\ncomplainant down on the bed. See Synnott, 2005 VT 19, \u00b6 20. And, unlike a case involving sexual\n\nassault or robbery, defendant\u2019s act of restraining the complainant was not inherent in the nature of\n\nthe assault. Cf. Goodhue, 2003 VT 85, \u00b6 23 (concluding that movement of victim from kitchen to\n\nbathroom floor did not exceed confinement or removal inherent in commission of crime of sexual\n\nassault); State v. French, 139 Vt. 320, 321, 428 A.2d 1087, 1088 (1981) (recognizing general\n\nprinciple that conviction for kidnapping and rape or robbery \u201cwill not stand where the detention\n\nnecessary to support the kidnapping conviction was quantitatively no greater than the detention\n\nwhich is, by virtue of the nature of the crime, incidental to the underlying rape or robbery\u201d). Nor\n\ndid the confinement facilitate the assault, which was completed at the time that defendant began\n\nholding down the complainant. Defendant\u2019s act increased the risk of harm to the complainant, as\n\nevidenced by her testimony that she had bruises on her forearms where he held them down. Under\n\nthese circumstances, the confinement was significant enough to warrant independent prosecution.\n\nThe trial court therefore did not commit error, let alone plain error, in failing to acquit defendant\n\nof unlawful restraint on its own motion.\n\n                                                 13\n\f       \u00b6 31.   Defendant also argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it had\n\nto decide whether the restraint was incidental to the assault. Defendant did not object to the lack\n\nof such an instruction at a charge conference or before the jury retired to consider its verdict, and\n\ntherefore did not preserve this argument for review. See State v. Gates, 2020 VT 21, \u00b6 55, __ Vt.\n\n__, 230 A.3d 595; V.R.Cr.P. 30(b). Accordingly, we review the instructions for plain error. State\n\nv. Carter, 2017 VT 32, \u00b6 6, 204 Vt. 383, 169 A.3d 225 (\u201cWhere there has been no objection to the\n\ninstruction in the trial court as required by Vermont Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 30, we\n\nreview only for plain error.\u201d). \u201cThere is no error if the jury charge as a whole conveys the true\n\nspirit and doctrine of the law, and there is no fair ground to say the jury has been misled by it.\u201d\n\nState v. Streich, 163 Vt. 331, 352-53, 658 A.2d 38, 53 (1995) (quotation omitted).\n\n       \u00b6 32.   We have reviewed the jury instructions, and they fairly reflect the law. As stated\n\nabove, to establish that defendant was guilty of unlawful restraint, the State had to prove that\n\ndefendant knowingly restrained the complainant for a substantial period.                  13 V.S.A.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 2404(3)(C), 2406(a)(3).      Whether the restraint was independently significant from the\n\naccompanying assaults was not an element of the crime, and we have never held or suggested that\n\nthis is an issue for the jury to decide. See State v. Pike, 143 Vt. 283, 289, 465 A.2d 1348, 1351\n\n(1983) (\u201c[T]he function of a jury is to be the finder of facts. A jury has no role in threshold\n\ndeterminations of legal issues.\u201d). Even if the independent significance of the confinement could\n\nbe a question for the jury in an appropriate case,5 \u201c[t]he court is not required to instruct jurors on\n\n\n       5\n          Like Vermont, most states do not permit separate convictions for kidnapping or unlawful\nrestraint and another crime where the kidnapping or restraint was merely incidental to that other\ncrime. See Goodhue, 2003 VT 85, \u00b6 16; State v. Teats, 468 S.W.3d 495, 504 n.13 (Tenn. 2015)\n(collecting cases). Some jurisdictions view this as a factual question to be decided by the jury.\nTeats, 468 S.W.3d at 504 (noting that Tennessee, some California courts, Connecticut, and Texas\nuse jury instruction to determine if kidnapping is incidental); see also Weber v. State, 547 A.2d\n948, 959 (Del. 1988) (requiring trial judge to determine if facts could support determination that\nkidnapping was independent of accompanying crime, and if so, to specifically instruct jury to find\nthat movement or restraint is independent and not incidental). Other jurisdictions have concluded\nthat whether a restraint is merely incidental to an accompanying crime is a question for the trial\ncourt to decide. In State v. Warner, the Rhode Island Supreme Court concluded that because the\n                                                 14\n\ftheories of defense that the defendant has not pursued.\u201d State v. Buckley, 2016 VT 59, \u00b6 21, 202\n\nVt. 371, 149 A.3d 928. Accordingly, we see no error.\n\n       \u00b6 33.   In conclusion, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction of unlawful restraint and reverse\n\nhis convictions of unlawful trespass and obstruction of justice. Because the trial court imposed\n\nseparate sentences for each offense and the convictions and sentences for the reversed convictions\n\ndo not appear to have influenced the sentencing for the affirmed convictions, we do not remand\n\nfor resentencing. See State v. Simpson, 160 Vt. 220, 225, 627 A.2d 346, 350 (1993).\n\n      Defendant\u2019s convictions of unlawful trespass and obstruction of justice are reversed. The\njudgment is otherwise affirmed.\n\n                                               FOR THE COURT:\n\n\n\n                                               Associate Justice\n\n\n\n\nrequirement that a kidnapping be independently significant was a judicially created doctrine that\ndid not affect the elements of the crime, but simply added a legal barrier to the charging process,\nits implementation was best left to the trial judge. 626 A.2d 205, 208 (R.I. 1993). Similarly, in\nHagins v. United States, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the doctrine of\nindependent significance, \u201cwhich acts as a check upon over-zealous use of th[e kidnapping]\ncharge,\u201d was a matter of law for the court to decide. 639 A.2d 612, 617 (D.C. 1994). It explained,\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s function is to apply the statutory elements of the crime to the facts at hand, and \u2018non-\ncoextensive\u2019 (or \u2018non-incidental\u2019) confinement . . . is not such an element.\u201d Id.\n                                                 15\n\f",
