He subsequently filed a motion to withdraw his notice of\r\nappeal, stating that he is of the opinion that this court does not yet have jurisdiction over the\r\nappeal.  In relevant portion, Rule 42.2 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure states:\r\n(a) At any time before the appellate court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision, the appellate court may dismiss\r\nthe appeal if the appellant withdraws his or her notice of appeal.  The appellant and\r\nhis or her attorney must sign the written withdrawal and file it in duplicate with the\r\nappellate clerk, who must immediately send the duplicate copy to the trial court clerk.\r\n\r\nTex. R. App. P. 42.2(a).  We have not issued a decision in this appeal.  The motion is signed\r\nby both Jannotti and his attorney.  See id.  A copy has been sent to the trial court clerk.
