Johnson, Clerk\n\f          Appellant, Roland E. Simms, was indicted in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s\n\nCounty and charged with attempted first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder\n\nand related counts. Following a jury trial, he was acquitted of the two attempted murder\n\ncounts and convicted of: first and second-degree assault; reckless endangerment; use of a\n\nfirearm in the commission of a crime of violence; illegal possession of a firearm;\n\nwearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun; and violation of a protective order.\n\nAppellant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 50 years with all but 30 years\n\nsuspended in favor of five years\u2019 supervised probation, plus credit for time served, as\n\nfollows: 25 years, with all but 20 suspended, for first degree assault; 20 years\n\nconsecutive, with all but five suspended, for use of a firearm; five years consecutive for\n\nillegal possession of a regulated firearm; three years concurrent for wearing, carrying, or\n\ntransporting a handgun; and 90 days concurrent for violating a protective order.\n\nAppellant timely appealed and presents the following questions for our review:\n\n          1. Did the trial court err when it failed to consider taking a partial verdict\n             on the ground that in order to take a partial verdict, both sides must\n             agree?\n\n          2. Did the court err in imposing separate sentences for first degree assault,\n             use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, illegal\n             possession of a firearm, wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun,\n             and violation of a protective order?\n\n          For the following reasons, we shall vacate appellant\u2019s sentences for wearing,\n\ncarrying, or transporting a firearm and violating a protective order and, otherwise, shall\n\naffirm.\n\f                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       Although we have reviewed the record as a whole, \u201c[i]t is unnecessary to recite the\n\nunderlying facts in any but a summary fashion because for the most part they [otherwise]\n\ndo not bear on the issues we are asked to consider.\u201d Teixeira v. State, 213 Md. App. 664,\n\n666 (2013) (citations and quotations omitted); accord Kennedy v. State, 436 Md. 686,\n\n688 (2014). Appellant was charged with shooting Christina Warrick, the mother of his\n\nthree children, at a bus stop located in Oxon Hill, Maryland, on the morning of January\n\n24, 2017. Warrick survived and testified against appellant at trial. She informed the jury\n\nthat she was standing at a bus stop with three of her daughters when appellant approached\n\nher with \u201cthe look of death on his face,\u201d stated \u201cbitch, you tell him everything,\u201d and then\n\npunched her in the face.\n\n       Warrick told her daughters to run and tried to fight back, but appellant pushed her\n\nto the ground and pulled out a handgun. He then fired one shot at Warrick\u2019s face,\n\nhowever, Warrick turned her head and the shot only grazed her nose. Warrick managed\n\nto get up off the ground momentarily, but appellant pushed her back down to the ground\n\nand fired another shot and that second shot struck Warrick in the chest.\n\n       Warrick also testified that she previously had obtained a final protective order\n\nagainst appellant on August 8, 2016. The protective order was good for one year and\n\nrequired that appellant have no contact with Warrick or her children. Warrick\u2019s account\n\nof the shooting was corroborated by her daughters, A.S., S.W., and A.W., as well as\n\nKoffi Soedje, who were all present at the bus stop and witnessed the shooting.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       We shall include additional detail in the following discussion.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       Appellant contends that the circuit court erred by not considering taking a partial\n\nverdict because it thought both sides had to agree in order to do so. The State responds\n\nthat appellant waived this issue by acquiescing to the court\u2019s decision and foregoing any\n\nsuggestion of a partial verdict in lieu of a requested modified Allen charge.1 The State\n\nalso argues the court properly exercised its discretion on the merits of the original request\n\nfor a partial verdict.\n\n       After deliberations began, the jury sent out several notes seeking clarification\n\nabout the elements of the charged offenses.2 The jury then sent out a note, which read:\n\n\n       1\n         The term \u201cAllen charge\u201d or \u201cinstruction\u201d refers to \u201ca United States Supreme\nCourt opinion \u2018approv[ing] the use of an instruction in which the jury was specifically\nasked to conciliate their differences and reach a verdict.\u2019\u201d Nash v. State, 439 Md. 53, 90-\n91 (2014) (quoting Kelly v. State, 270 Md. 139, 140 n.1 (1973)) (citing Allen v. United\nStates, 164 U.S. 492 (1896)), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 284 (2014). While the original\nAllen instruction is disfavored, a court has discretion to give a modified version, when\napplicable, that closely follows the pattern instruction concerning a jury\u2019s duty to\ndeliberate. Nash, 439 Md. at 91 (citing MCPJI 2:01).\n       2\n         The jury\u2019s notes are included with the record on appeal, albeit not in the proper\nsequence as provided in the transcript. Notably, the record does not reveal the time of\nday when the jury notes were received. Further, appellant\u2019s claim only concerns the\nnotes that inform the court of the jury\u2019s initial inability to reach a unanimous verdict\nduring deliberations. Solely for the sake of completeness, one of the other jury notes\nasked, verbatim: \u201cIf you agree or disagree of use of a firearm in the first degree or second\ndegree of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence does it have to apply?\nClarification is needed . . . .\u201d After the court responded by asking the jury to reword that\nquestion, the jury sent out a note indicating that \u201cWe no longer need clarity on this\nquestion.\u201d The other jury note included in the record asked: \u201cDoes [sic] all qualifications\nhave to apply for charges to reach a verdict.\u201d When the court, with the approval of the\n                                              3\n\f\u201cWe are not able to reach a unanimous decision on one charge yet.\u201d This note was\n\naddressed in court as follows:\n\n      THE COURT: So what do you want me to say? You must keep\n      deliberating, correct? What other answer is there? I\u2019m not taking a partial\n      verdict. I\u2019m not letting them go home when they only went out at \u2013 what\n      was that? 1:30?\n\n      THE DEPUTY CLERK: 1:30, 1:45.\n\n      THE COURT: It hasn\u2019t even been \u2013 unless you think there\u2019s another\n      option.\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We could talk about taking a partial verdict.\n\n      [PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019d prefer further deliberations. Perhaps the Allen\n      charge, and then after \u2013 you know.\n\n      THE COURT: Not an Allen charge now.\n\n      [PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m fine with continue deliberating.\n\n      THE COURT: Please continue deliberating.\n\n      [PROSECUTOR]: Because the Allen charge, I mean, we all agree that it\n      doesn\u2019t say much.\n\n      THE COURT: So do you object to me telling them please continue\n      deliberating?\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Might as well. I think it says only one is left.\n\n      [PROSECUTOR]: That\u2019s the same reading that I have.\n\n\nparties, responded by asking what the jury meant by \u201cqualifications,\u201d the jury asked \u201cDo\nall bullet points under the charges have to be met to reach a complete verdict?\u201d The\ncourt, as approved by the parties, asked for clarification of which charges were of\nconcern, and the jury indicated \u201cMPJI-Cr 4:17.13,\u201d referring to the instruction for\nattempted first-degree and second-degree murder. With the approval of the parties, the\ncourt replied to the original query on this note by answering: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n                                            4\n\f      (Whereupon, the Court and counsel signed the Court\u2019s response to the\n      jury\u2019s note.)\n\n      THE COURT: Your signature is fine. What else?\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t want it to be imputed that I\u2019m agreeing.\n      That\u2019s all.\n\n      THE COURT: It does mean you\u2019re agreeing. You object to that? Because\n      I wouldn\u2019t have written it down if you were objecting to my saying, \u201cPlease\n      continue to deliberate.\u201d\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.\n\n      THE COURT: If they don\u2019t deliberate and they don\u2019t agree \u2013 in order to\n      take a partial verdict, both sides must agree. They are not agreeing to it\n      now. The only other option is to continue deliberating, because I am not\n      going to declare a mistrial.\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.\n\n      THE COURT: What else is there?\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right.\n\n      THE COURT: You know that they have to agree.\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I know that we all have to agree.\n\n      THE COURT: Right.\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s true. And if I request a mistrial at this\n      point?\n\n      THE COURT: I would not grant it. It\u2019s way too early. I\u2019ll make them\n      come back and stay all day tomorrow before I do that.\n\n      The circuit court then wrote on the jury note: \u201cPlease continue to deliberate.\u201d The\n\nnote was signed by the court and counsel for both parties. The jury then sent a short note\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fasking for a brief recess and requesting water. The court granted both requests after a\n\ndiscussion on the record.\n\n       After that short break, the circuit court reconvened the parties and informed them\n\nthat it was going to direct the bailiff to ask the jurors if they wanted to keep deliberating\n\nor go home. Although defense counsel proposed a sort of modified Allen charge, that\n\napparently differed from the pattern instructions, neither party objected to the court\u2019s\n\nchosen course of action.3 The jurors then responded, with 5 jurors indicating they wanted\n\nto stay and 7 jurors indicating they wanted to go home. Both parties agreed that the jury\n\nshould stay. After defense counsel queried whether the court should give the Allen\n\ninstruction, the court replied, \u201cit\u2019s not time for an Allen charge. Absolutely not. That\n\nwould be tomorrow if anything.\u201d The court then wrote a note, which was agreed to and\n\nsigned by both attorneys instructing the jury, to \u201c[k]eep [d]eliberating.\u201d\n\n       However, as this response was being sent to the jury room, the bailiff informed the\n\ncourt that the jury sent out another note, which read: \u201cIf we can\u2019t come to a consensus,\n\nwhat\u2019s next?\u201d The following then ensued:\n\n       THE COURT: All right. How do you want me to respond to this note?\n       State first.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: I think it\u2019s the response that you wrote down on here,\n       on the note that just went back, which is keep deliberating. Should we end\n       deliberations today without a verdict? I think the Allen charge would be\n       appropriate to begin tomorrow morning as opposed to giving it this\n       evening.\n\n       THE COURT: I\u2019ll hear from you.\n\n       3\n        Defense counsel\u2019s proposed instruction, which he designated as an \u201canti-Allen\ncharge,\u201d does not appear to be included in the record.\n                                              6\n\f[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, my overriding concern is that the jurors\ndon\u2019t feel as though it is required for people to start changing votes to reach\nunanimity. That\u2019s why I proposed \u2013\n\nTHE COURT: We have no idea what the discussions are back there.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, we have an idea that they are not agreeing.\n\nTHE COURT: As to one.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: They\u2019ve sent one note saying that they can\u2019t\nagree. And now, this one is saying, what are we to do if we can\u2019t reach a\nconsensus? What\u2019s next?\n\nTHE COURT: There is no next. They have to keep deliberating until I\ngive the Allen charge. I agree with [the prosecutor]. It\u2019s not appropriate to\ngive it at this time and send it back at quarter to 7:00. No. It makes no\nsense to do it now.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But I am not asking for an Allen charge. I\u2019m\nasking for a very specific instruction.\n\nTHE COURT: I will give nothing but the Allen charge because Maryland\nlaw instructs me to give the Allen charge, which is essentially the same\nthing you\u2019re asking. I wouldn\u2019t give this until tomorrow, but I won\u2019t give it\nat all. I\u2019m going to put that on the record. That\u2019s not happening. No. I will\ngive this Allen charge because it\u2019s clear by Maryland law.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m not asking for that.\n\nTHE COURT: Well, you don\u2019t want this now?\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (Shakes head.)\n\nTHE COURT: So then I have to say to them, \u201cKeep deliberating until.\u201d\nI\u2019ll give them again until 7:30. I\u2019ll give them another 45 minutes. It\u2019s way\ntoo early. They didn\u2019t start until 1:40. It\u2019s not even a second day of\ndeliberations, so I will not do it. No.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.\nTHE COURT: All right. Keep deliberating.\n\n\n                                       7\n\f       The circuit court then sent a response to the jury instructing them to, \u201cKeep\n\ndeliberating,\u201d the court and counsel for both parties signed the response. Soon after, the\n\njury informed the court \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a verdict.\u201d\n\n       On appeal, the State\u2019s initial response to appellant\u2019s argument is that he waived\n\nthis issue. Maryland\u2019s appellate courts ordinarily will not consider \u201cany issue \u2018unless it\n\nplainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\u2019\u201d\n\nKing v. State, 434 Md. 472, 479 (2013) (quoting Md. Rule 8-131(a)). Further, where a\n\nparty acquiesces in a court\u2019s ruling, there is no basis for appeal from that ruling. See\n\nGrandison v. State, 305 Md. 685, 765 (1986) (\u201cBy dropping the subject and never again\n\nraising it, [appellant] waived his right to appellate review[.]\u201d), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 873\n\n(1986). As the Court of Appeals has further explained: \u201c[t]he doctrine of acquiescence --\n\nor waiver -- is that \u2018a voluntary act of a party which is inconsistent with the assignment of\n\nerrors on appeal normally precludes that party from obtaining appellate review.\u2019\u201d Exxon\n\nMobil Corp. v. Ford, 433 Md. 426, 463 (2013) (citations and quotations omitted); see\n\nalso Gilliam v. State, 331 Md. 651, 691 (1993) (\u201cAs Gilliam did not object to the course\n\nof action proposed by the prosecution and taken by the court, and apparently indicated his\n\nagreement with it, he cannot now be heard to complain that the trial court\u2019s action was\n\nwrong\u201d).\n\n       Here, when the jury submitted the note indicating that they had not reached a\n\nunanimous verdict on one count, the court was the first to mention a partial verdict,\n\nstating \u201cI\u2019m not taking a partial verdict.\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201c[w]e could talk\n\nabout taking a partial verdict.\u201d The parties moved on, without significant discussion, by\n\n                                              8\n\fconsidering a response that told the jury to keep deliberating. After defense counsel\n\ninitially objected to that instruction, the court declared that it would not give the\n\nsupplemental instruction to keep deliberating unless counsel agreed.\n\n       It was at this point that the circuit court stated, \u201c[i]f they don\u2019t deliberate and they\n\ndon\u2019t agree \u2013 in order to take a partial verdict, both sides must agree. They are not\n\nagreeing to it now.\u201d The court also stated that \u201c[y]ou know that they have to agree.\u201d\n\nAlthough it appears that the court was referring to the jury when it stated that \u201cthey\u201d must\n\nagree, defense counsel added, \u201cI know that we all have to agree.\u201d The court agreed with\n\nthis statement as well. Defense counsel then queried, \u201cAnd if I request a mistrial at this\n\npoint?\u201d The court responded, and concluded this discussion, by stating, \u201cI would not\n\ngrant it. It\u2019s way too early. I\u2019ll make them come back and stay all day tomorrow before I\n\ndo that.\u201d Throughout the remainder of the discussions over the subsequent jury notes, the\n\nparties never again mentioned a partial verdict and instead focused on whether or not to\n\ngive a \u201cmodified-Allen instruction.\u201d\n\n       We are persuaded by the State\u2019s waiver argument. The possibility, or lack thereof,\n\nof a partial verdict was first broached by the circuit court. When defense counsel\n\nsuggested the issue could be further discussed, there was no significant discussion of that\n\nalternative. Instead, the focus was on whether the court should tell the jury to keep\n\ndeliberating. Indeed, when the court indicated that a partial verdict was not an option at\n\nthis point, defense counsel agreed, stating \u201cI know that we all have to agree.\u201d Considered\n\nalong with the discussions about subsequent jury notes, which lacked any further mention\n\nof a partial verdict, we conclude that defense counsel acquiesced to the court\u2019s decision.\n\n                                               9\n\f       Even were the issue preserved, we are unable to conclude that the circuit court\n\nerred or abused its discretion. A criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to an\n\nimpartial jury by the Sixth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. See Attorney\n\nGrievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Gansler, 377 Md. 656, 674-75 (2003) (citations\n\nomitted). For a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal case tried to be final, \u201cthe jury must\n\nintentionally render a unanimous verdict.\u201d Caldwell v. State, 164 Md. App. 612 (2005)\n\n(citations omitted); see also Md. Rule 4-327(a) (\u201cThe verdict of a jury shall be\n\nunanimous[.]\u201d). \u201cA verdict is defective for lack of unanimity when it is unclear whether\n\nall of the jurors have agreed to it.\u201d Caldwell, 164 Md. App. at 636 (citing Lattisaw v.\n\nState, 329 Md. 339, 346-47 (1993)). Whether the verdict itself satisfies the unanimous\n\nconsent \u201crequirement is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo[.]\u201d\n\nId. at 643.\n\n       The Maryland Rules, however, provide for judicial discretion in the acceptance of\n\npartial verdicts:\n\n       When there are two or more counts, the jury may return a verdict with\n       respect to a count as to which it has agreed, and any count as to which the\n       jury cannot agree may be tried again.\n\nMd. Rule 4-327(d); see also State v. Fennell, 431 Md. 500, 520, 524 (2013) (recognizing\n\nthat partial verdicts are allowed in Maryland under certain circumstances and agreeing\n\n\u201cthat the partial verdict inquiry is largely an exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion\u201d).\n\n       Two cases inform our analysis. In Caldwell, after the jurors had been deliberating\n\nfor some time, the circuit court was advised that the courthouse would be closing at 1:00\n\n                                               10\n\fp.m. because of an impending hurricane. Caldwell, 164 Md. App. at 624. The jury was\n\nreturned to the courtroom and informed that the courthouse was closing and was unlikely\n\nto be open the next day, which was a Friday. Id. One of the jurors was unable to return\n\nto the courthouse the following Monday, when the courthouse would reopen, and the\n\ndefendant was unwilling to proceed with an eleven-person jury. Id. at 624-25. The\n\ncircuit court asked the foreperson if the jury had reached an agreement on any of the\n\ncounts. Id. at 625-26. When the foreperson indicated that the jury had reached a\n\nunanimous agreement on \u201cevery count but one,\u201d the court decided, over defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s objection, to take verdicts on those counts. Id. at 626-27. The circuit court\n\nacknowledged that the jury \u201cpossibly could\u201d reach verdicts on the undecided counts, but\n\nthat it would declare a mistrial on those remaining counts due to the circumstances. Id. at\n\n627.\n\n       On appeal, Caldwell claimed that the circuit court erred in accepting partial\n\nverdicts on tentative votes that were not yet final and in forcing the verdicts, denying him\n\nhis right to an impartial jury. Caldwell, 164 Md. App. at 633. This Court stated the\n\ndeterminative issue was \u201cwhether, when the jurors ceased their deliberation, upon being\n\ninterrupted and called into the courtroom, they had reached a final agreement on the\n\ncounts on which the court then accepted verdicts.\u201d Id. at 635.\n\n       After considering cases from other jurisdictions, and the requirement that a verdict\n\nbe supported by unanimous consent, this Court concluded:\n\n       The cases we have discussed teach that, to satisfy the unanimous consent\n       requirement, a verdict must be unambiguous and unconditional and must be\n\n                                             11\n\f       final - in the sense of not being provisional or tentative and, to the contrary,\n       being intended as the last resolution of the issue and not subject to change\n       in further deliberation. A verdict that is tentative, not being by unanimous\n       consent, is defective and not valid. In deciding whether to accept a partial\n       verdict, a trial judge must guard against the danger of transforming a\n       provisional decision into a final verdict. Just as when the total\n       circumstances disclose an ambiguity or qualification in a verdict, when they\n       suggest that the jury has made a tentative decision, the court must not\n       accept the verdict. It should inquire into the jury\u2019s intention vel non that\n       the verdict be final, if such inquiry can be done non-coercively; return the\n       jury for further deliberation; or, if that is not possible and there is manifest\n       necessity, declare a mistrial. Doubt must be resolved in favor of the\n       defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a verdict by unanimous consent.\n\nCaldwell, 164 Md. App. at 642-43.\n\n       We further concluded that in Caldwell\u2019s case, \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the\n\npartial verdicts indicated that they were tentative votes the jurors did not intend to be\n\nfinal, irrevocable verdicts.\u201d Caldwell, 164 Md. App. at 643. In support of that\n\nconclusion, we noted that \u201c[t]he emergency closure of the courthouse, compounded by\n\none juror\u2019s inability to return for deliberations the following Monday, disrupted and\n\nderailed the deliberations midstream, bringing them to an abrupt conclusion.\u201d Id. As a\n\nresult, we held that the partial verdicts \u201cwere defective, because they were not final\n\ndecisions and therefore did not meet the requirement of unanimous consent.\u201d Id. at 646-\n\n47.\n\n       In State v. Fennell, after approximately three hours of deliberations, the jury\n\ninformed the circuit court, via an \u201cunsolicited, completed verdict sheet,\u201d that it had voted\n\nunanimously to acquit Fennell of three charges of first degree assault, conspiracy to\n\ncommit first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit robbery, but was unable to agree\n\non two charges of robbery and second-degree assault. Fennell, 431 Md. at 505. After\n\n                                             12\n\fconsulting with counsel, and at defense counsel\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the\n\njury to \u201c[p]lease continue to deliberate regarding the counts as to which you are\n\nundecided.\u201d Id. at 508. A half hour later, after the court called the jury into the\n\ncourtroom, the foreperson informed the court that \u201cthere\u2019s a clear division on the amount\n\nof evidence, and how you read the evidence.\u201d Id. at 509. Defense counsel asked the\n\njudge to take a partial verdict on the counts where the jury was unanimous in their\n\ndecision. Id. at 510. After the prosecutor noted an objection, the court declined to take a\n\npartial verdict, and instead declared a mistrial as to all counts. Id.\n\n       Fennell then filed a \u201cMotion to Bar Retrial Due to Double Jeopardy\u201d as to the\n\nthree counts where the jury indicated they had unanimously voted for acquittal. Fennell,\n\n431 Md. at 510-11. Fennell agreed that he consented to be retried on the remaining two\n\ncharges. Id. at 511. The motions court ultimately denied the motion to bar retrial. Id.\n\n       This Court reversed, concluding that the trial court did not consider reasonable\n\nalternatives, and that no manifest necessity existed for the mistrial. Fennell, 431 Md. at\n\n511-12. After granting the State\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, the Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed this Court\u2019s judgment. Id. at 527. Although the Court of Appeals recognized\n\nthat \u201cthe mere theoretical availability of partial verdicts does not necessitate a further\n\ninquiry by the trial court where, for example, no party has requested a partial verdict be\n\ntaken or the jury does not indicate that it has reached one[.]\u201d id., it went on to state that,\n\n\u201c[t]his does not mean . . . that the trial judge is not permitted to inquire of a jury as to the\n\npossibility of a partial verdict where it has not been indicated by the jury or requested by\n\ncounsel -- rather, it remains within the court\u2019s discretion to do so.\u201d Id. The Court further\n\n                                               13\n\fobserved:\n\n       Where, however, the jury indicates to the court that unanimity was\n       achieved, at some point, on one or more counts, [Md.] Rule 4-327(d) points\n       the way for a trial judge to a reasonable alternative to the declaration of a\n       mistrial. Thus, prior to declaring a mistrial without consent on those\n       counts, the trial judge generally should take steps to determine that genuine\n       deadlock exists as to those counts.\n\nId. at 523.\n\n       The Court concluded:\n\n       Viewing the record as a whole, however, we conclude that the jury\u2019s\n       unsolicited submission of the completed verdict sheet, the trial judge\u2019s\n       subsequent instructions, and the ultimate colloquy between the jury\n       foreperson and the trial court reveals an ambiguity as to the jury\u2019s intent\n       and resulting deadlock that was never resolved satisfactorily by the trial\n       court. The jury\u2019s delivery to the court of the verdict sheet indicated facially\n       that the jury agreed unanimously to acquit the defendant on the charges of\n       first degree assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and\n       conspiracy to commit robbery, but was deadlocked as to the remaining two\n       charges.\n\nId. at 524.\n\n       Because the reason for the circuit court\u2019s denial of the request for a partial verdict\n\nwas \u201cunclear,\u201d the Court then held:\n\n       Because the trial judge was on notice that the jury may have reached a\n       partial verdict, an ambiguity as to unanimity persisted through the colloquy\n       with the jury, defense counsel requested a partial verdict, and the specter of\n       coercion was low due to the posture of the jury\u2019s deliberations, [Md.] Rule\n       4-327(d) provided the trial judge with a reasonable alternative to the\n       declaration of a mistrial. Thus, before a proper finding of manifest\n       necessity for a mistrial could have been made, the trial judge should have\n       inquired into the jury\u2019s status of unanimity prior to its discharge. Failure to\n       do so was an abuse of discretion, and retrial on the charges of first degree\n       assault, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and conspiracy to\n       commit robbery is barred by double jeopardy.\n\nId. at 526.\n\n                                             14\n\f       Caldwell teaches that all jurors must agree to the verdict, or parts thereof in case of\n\na partial verdict, to satisfy the unanimity requirement. Fennell adds to that lesson by\n\nobserving, inter alia, that a trial court may consider requests for a partial verdict when\n\nmade by one party. Id. at 522. Fennell also instructs that the decision whether to accept\n\na partial verdict is a matter of trial court discretion. Id. at 522-24. Thus, the circuit court\n\nin this case was correct when it observed that the jury must unanimously agree to a partial\n\nverdict. However, to the extent that the court\u2019s comments in this case required that both\n\nappellant and the State agree before it could take a partial verdict, the court was incorrect.\n\n       It is for this reason that appellant insists that the circuit court applied a \u201cuniform\n\nrule,\u201d thereby failing to exercise discretion. Accordingly, appellant argues that the\n\ncourt\u2019s failure to exercise discretion amounted to an abuse of discretion. See 101 Geneva\n\nLLC v. Wynn, 435 Md. 233, 241 (2013) (\u201cIt is well settled that a trial judge who\n\nencounters a matter that falls within the realm of judicial discretion must exercise his or\n\nher discretion in ruling on the matter.\u201d) (emphasis in original) (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted); Gray v. State, 368 Md. 529, 565 (2002) (\u201c[O]ur cases hold that the\n\nactual failure to exercise discretion is an abuse of discretion\u201d).\n\n       We are not persuaded on this point by appellant. Apart from appellant\u2019s apparent\n\nwaiver of the issue, the record reveals that the circuit court never indicated that it would\n\nnot consider a partial verdict, or a mistrial for that matter. Instead, the court merely\n\nstated that it would not consider a partial verdict that early in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\n\nIndeed, when the additional note came from the jury asking what they should do if they\n\nstill could not reach a consensus, notably without any indication as before as to whether\n\n                                              15\n\fthey disagreed on just one count or all of them, appellant did not mention the possible\n\nremedy of a partial verdict. Instead, the colloquy focused on whether and when to give a\n\nversion of the \u201cmodified-Allen instruction.\u201d Moreover, the jury\u2019s verdict in this case was\n\nunanimous and final, and there is no indication that it was \u201cambiguous, inconsistent,\n\nunresponsive, or otherwise defective\u201d in any way. Lattisaw, 329 Md. at 345 (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted). Under the facts of this case, we conclude that discretion\n\nwas exercised, and that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion concerning this issue.\n\n                                                   II.\n\n       Appellant next asserts that he was illegally sentenced for wearing, carrying, or\n\ntransporting a handgun, and for violation of a protective order. Appellant\u2019s position is\n\nthat wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun merges with use of a firearm, and that\n\nviolation of a protective order merges with either first degree assault or illegal possession\n\nof a firearm. The State agrees, as do we.\n\n       Merging convictions for purposes of sentencing derives from the double jeopardy\n\nprohibition of the Fifth Amendment and Maryland common law. Brooks v. State, 439\n\nMd. 698, 737 (2014). \u201cMaryland recognizes three grounds for merging a defendant\u2019s\n\nconvictions: (1) the required evidence test; (2) the rule of lenity; and (3) \u2018the principle of\n\nfundamental fairness.\u2019\u201d Carroll v. State, 428 Md. 679, 693-94 (2012) (quoting Monoker\n\nv. State, 321 Md. 214, 222-23 (1990)); see also Pair v. State, 202 Md. App. 617, 625\n\n(2011) (review of court\u2019s decision regarding merger pursuant to the \u201crequired evidence\u201d\n\ntest or \u201cthe rule of lenity\u201d is decided \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d). An appellate court is\n\nafforded the authority to review an allegedly illegal sentence notwithstanding a failure to\n\n                                              16\n\fobject to the same at trial. Montgomery v. State, 206 Md. App. 357, 410 (2012) (citation\n\nomitted), cert. denied, 429 Md. 83 (2012); see also Md. Rule 4-345(a) (\u201cThe court may\n\ncorrect an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d).\n\n       \u201cUnder the rule of lenity, a court confronted with an otherwise unresolvable\n\nambiguity in a criminal statute that allows for two possible interpretations of the statute\n\nwill opt for the construction that favors the defendant.\u201d Bellard v. State, 452 Md. 467,\n\n502 (2017) (quoting Oglesby v. State, 441 Md. 673, 681 (2015)); see also Alexis v. State,\n\n437 Md. 457, 484-85 (2014) (\u201cThe rule of lenity is a common law doctrine that directs\n\ncourts to construe ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of criminal defendants.\u201d). Stated\n\nanother way, \u201c[i]f the intent of the legislature to impose separate punishments for\n\nmultiple convictions arising out of the same conduct or transaction is unclear, then the\n\nrule of lenity generally precludes the imposition of separate sentences.\u201d Paige v. State,\n\n222 Md. App. 190, 207 (2015); see also Marquardt v. State, 164 Md. App. 95, 149\n\n(2005) (concluding that, under the rule of lenity, any \u201cdoubt or ambiguity as to whether\n\nthe legislature intended that there be multiple punishments for the same act or transaction\n\nwill be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u201d) (quoting\n\nWilliams v. State, 323 Md. 312, 321 (1991)), cert. denied, 390 Md. 91 (2005).\n\n       Maryland appellate courts have clearly held, under the rule of lenity, that \u201cwhen\n\nconvictions for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and wearing,\n\ncarrying, or transporting a handgun are based upon the same acts, separate sentences for\n\nthose convictions will not stand.\u201d Holmes v. State, 209 Md. App. 427, 456 (2013) (citing\n\nWilkens v. State, 343 Md. 444, 446-47 (1996), Hunt v. State, 312 Md. 494, 510 (1988)),\n\n                                              17\n\fcert. denied, 431 Md. 445 (2013). There is no dispute in this case that the convictions\n\nwere based on the same act, thus we shall vacate appellant\u2019s sentence for wearing,\n\ncarrying, or transporting a handgun.\n\n       As for whether violation of a protective order must merge with the sentence for\n\nfirst-degree assault, there does not appear to be a case directly on point. However, in\n\nQuansah v. State, 207 Md. App. 636, 640 (2012), cert. denied, 430 Md. 13 (2013), this\n\nCourt held that, under the rule of lenity, the \u201csentence for violating a peace order must be\n\nmerged into [the] sentence for second-degree assault because both convictions may have\n\nbeen based on a single act.\u201d See Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.) Courts & Judicial\n\nProceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 3-1508 (establishing the penalties for violation of an\n\ninterim peace order). In that case, we rejected the State\u2019s contention that the two offenses\n\nwere \u201cbased on different behavior\u201d because the peace order statute \u201cpunishes the\n\nviolation of a court order,\u201d whereas \u201cassault is a crime against the person.\u201d Id. at 656.\n\nWe explained that \u201c[t]his argument ignores that the peace order statute, like second-\n\ndegree assault, punishes unlawful contact with a person and that appellant\u2019s two\n\nsentences punish him for the same \u2018criminal behavior\u2019 \u2014 the unlawful contact that\n\noccurred when he grabbed [the victim].\u201d Id.\n\n       Although Quansah concerned a peace order and this case involves a domestic\n\nprotective order, the State agrees that \u201cthere does not appear to be any substantial basis to\n\ndifferentiate the reasoning set forth in Quansah\u201d from the circumstances herein.\n\nGenerally, peace orders and protective orders are similar in that they are both civil orders\n\n\n                                             18\n\fissued by a judge, ordering one person to refrain from committing certain acts against\n\nothers, including, but not limited to, assault, rape, or sexual offenses, false imprisonment,\n\nand stalking. See CJP \u00a7\u00a7 3-1501, et. seq.; Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol), \u00a7\u00a7 4-501,\n\net. seq. of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). The relationship between the parties\n\ndetermines which type of order can be requested. Petitioners eligible for relief via\n\nprotective orders generally include relatives and individuals in domestic or sexual\n\nrelationships. See FL \u00a7 4-501(m). Peace orders generally apply to other persons. See\n\nCJP \u00a7 3-1502(a), (b).\n\n       Additionally, whereas Quansah involved a second-degree assault and this case\n\nconcerns assault in the first degree, we are persuaded that the reasoning in Quansah\n\napplies here. This is especially true considering that, under the required evidence test,\n\nsecond-degree assault is a lesser included offense of first-degree assault when the\n\noffenses arise out of the same event. See Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 3-202, 3-\n\n203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d). Cf. State v. Shird, 81 Md. App. 328, 336 (1989)\n\n(holding that assault is a lesser included offense of an aggravated assault where the\n\noffenses arise out of the same event).4\n\n       Moreover, both the first-degree assault and the protective order statutes include\n\nassaultive behavior as necessary elements of the offense. The first-degree assault statute,\n\nCL \u00a7 3-202(a), provides that a person may not \u201cintentionally cause or attempt to cause\n\n\n\n       4\n        The jury heard instructions on the battery form of second-degree assault, both\nmodalities of first-degree assault, and the crime of violating a protective order.\n\n                                             19\n\fserious physical injury to another\u201d or \u201ccommit an assault with a firearm[.]\u201d5 Similarly,\n\nthe domestic protective order statute defines \u201cabuse,\u201d under the statute the offense\n\nincludes, but is not limited to, an \u201cact that causes serious bodily harm;\u201d an \u201cact that\n\nplaces a person eligible for relief in fear of imminent serious bodily harm;\u201d or \u201cassault in\n\nany degree[.]\u201d See FL \u00a7 4-501(a)(i) - (iii). There is no indication in the statutes that the\n\nprohibited conduct in one of the statutes is any different from that or the other.\n\n       Finally, it appears that the State considered the criminal offenses to be based on\n\nthe same acts, at least considering its summation of the evidence that appellant was not\n\n\u201csupposed to abuse her, he wasn\u2019t supposed to threaten her, he wasn\u2019t supposed to\n\ncontact her in any way, and he was not supposed to possess a firearm.\u201d Based on the\n\nabove, we are persuaded that the jury could have found that appellant violated the\n\nprotective order when he assaulted Warrick. Thus, we shall vacate appellant\u2019s sentence\n\nfor violating a protective order because it merges with his sentence for first-degree\n\nassault under the rule of lenity.6\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Maryland recognizes three modalities of assault: \u201c\u20181. A consummated battery or\nthe combination of a consummated battery and its antecedent assault; 2. An attempted\nbattery; and 3. A placing of a victim in reasonable apprehension of an imminent\nbattery.\u2019\u201d Cruz v. State, 407 Md. 202, 209 n.3 (2009) (quoting Lamb v. State, 93 Md.\nApp. 422, 428 (1992), cert. denied, 329 Md. 110 (1993)).\n       6\n         We decline to address appellant\u2019s alternative argument that the sentence for\nviolating a protective order merges with his sentence for illegal possession of a firearm\nunder the required evidence test.

Hall, 416 Md. 533, 545 n.4\n(2010) (citation omitted) (declining to consider an alternative argument because: (a) it\nwas not raised in the petition or cross-petition; and, (b) because the lower court\u2019s opinion\nwas affirmed on the primary argument presented); see also Bowman Grp. v.
