In 1987, Turnage was convicted in the District\n\nCourt for the District of Maryland of robbery and larceny of a savings and loan and was\n\nsentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. From 1993 until 2004, Turnage was paroled and\n\nreimprisoned twice, and was, at one point, held in custody in Maryland while state\n\ncharges were pending against him. In the course of parole revocation proceedings, in\n\nMay 2005, Turnage was transferred to the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia and\n\nappeared briefly before a parole revocation hearing examiner. This hearing was\n\ncontinued, however.\n\n       Turnage subsequently filed a document titled \u201cMotion Pursuant to Nunc Pro\n\nTunc,\u201d which the District Court construed as a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2241. In this petition, Turnage raises several claims related to his impending parole\n\nrevocation proceedings. Turnage\u2019s primary claim appears to be that a report generated by\n\nthe United States Parole Commission, containing calculations of both his sentence credit\n\nand the number of days remaining on his sentence, is flawed in numerous ways. Turnage\n\nargues that if this report is relied on during his parole revocation hearing, he will be\n\ndeprived of a fair hearing and his sentence will be erroneously increased by over two\n\nyears. Turnage also asserts that the U.S. Marshals violated their own procedures when\n\nthey took him into custody in December 2004.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       The District Court granted Turnage\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and\n\nordered Respondents to file a response within 30 days of service. Nine days later,\n\nhowever, the District Court vacated that order and dismissed Turnage\u2019s petition without\n\nprejudice, holding that the petition was not yet ripe for adjudication. See Turnage v.\n\nUnited States Parole Comm\u2019n, et al., No. 05-cv-2659 (order entered July 20, 2005).\n\nTurnage timely filed this appeal.\n\n       We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.1 As a preliminary\n\nmatter, to the extent that Turnage\u2019s allegations that he was beaten when taken into\n\ncustody by the U.S. Marshals indicate an intent to raise an excessive force claim, such a\n\nclaim would be properly brought in a separate complaint filed under Bivens v. Six\n\nUnknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), rather\n\nthan in a habeas corpus petition. As to the remaining claims at issue on appeal, after a\n\ncareful review of the record, we conclude that they present \u201cno substantial question\u201d\n\nunder Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We will, therefore, summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment.\n\n       The question of ripeness implicates the competing concerns of whether the issues\n\nraised are fit for judicial review and what hardship will be experienced by the parties if\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Although the District Court\u2019s dismissal was without prejudice, it was based on\nripeness grounds. As Turnage cannot cure this defect, we have jurisdiction over the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order. See Presbytery of New Jersey v. Florio, 40 F.3d 1454, 1461 n.6\n(3d Cir. 1994).\n\n                                              3\n\fjudicial review is withheld. Felmeister v. Office of Att\u2019y Ethics, 856 F.2d 529, 535 (3d\n\nCir. 1988) (citing Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)). Fitness for\n\njudicial review depends on several factors, including whether the agency action is final,\n\nwhether the issues involve a question of law requiring no further factual development,\n\nand whether further administrative action is needed to clarify the agency\u2019s position.\n\nFelmeister, 856 F.2d at 535-37. When Turnage filed his habeas petition, the hearing on\n\nwhich his claims are based had not yet occurred and the agency action was not final.\n\nTherefore, the \u201cfitness for review\u201d prong of the ripeness inquiry was not satisfied.\n\n       The second prong of the ripeness inquiry is whether deferral of judicial review will\n\ncreate an immediate and significant hardship for the parties and, if so, whether this\n\nhardship outweighs the unfitness for review. See Felmeister, 856 F.2d at 537-38. If\n\nTurnage\u2019s allegations are true, and the erroneous report is eventually used to determine\n\nthe date of his ultimate release, then Turnage risks being incarcerated for longer than his\n\nsentence mandates. This could, indeed, constitute a \u201csignificant hardship\u201d as well as a\n\nviolation of Turnage\u2019s constitutional rights. However, we must stress that when Turnage\n\nfiled his habeas petition, the parole revocation hearing had not been held and this\n\n\u201chardship\u201d was merely hypothetical rather than \u201cimmediate and significant.\u201d The District\n\nCourt correctly dismissed Turnage\u2019s petition as unripe, as his claims were based on\n\n\u201ccontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at\n\nall.\u201d See Binker v. Com. of Pa., 977 F.2d 738, 753 (3d Cir. 1992) (internal citation\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fomitted). In his summary action response, Turnage contends that the \u201cissues and errors\n\nhad already been committed and were in place,\u201d making his claims ripe when he filed his\n\npetition. We disagree. While Turnage\u2019s factual allegations (and the Parole\n\nCommission\u2019s report itself) may have existed when he filed his petition, the report had\n\nnot yet been relied upon to Turnage\u2019s detriment and, therefore, as discussed above,\n\nTurnage had no habeas claim.2\n\n       Turnage also takes issue with the language of the District Court\u2019s order describing\n\nhis habeas claims as involving a parole request. We agree with Turnage that this is an\n\nimproper characterization of Turnage\u2019s claims, which focus on a pending parole\n\nrevocation hearing. We find this slip of the pen to be of no moment, however, as it does\n\nnot alter the fact that Turnage\u2019s claims were not ripe.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.\n\nSee Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        Turnage indicates in his summary action response that his parole revocation\nhearing has taken place and that the Parole Commission has issued a decision. If this is\nthe case, any claims arising from that proceeding would now be ripe. After Turnage fully\nexhausts available administrative remedies, he may file a new habeas petition raising\nthese claims.\n\f",
