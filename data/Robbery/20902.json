He was sentenced as a\npersistent offender to imprisonment for forty years and six months. After exhausting\n\n\n\n\n      *\n       The Honorable Lawrence L. Piersol, United States District Judge for the District\nof South Dakota, sitting by designation.\n\fhis state court remedies, Zinna filed a federal habeas petition. The district court**\ndenied relief, but granted a certificate of appealability on one claim: whether trial\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to call coperpetrator Billy Long as a witness. During\na state postconviction hearing, Long testified he would have told the jury Zinna was not\ninvolved in the robbery because he was sleeping at a motel at the time. At the same\nhearing, Zinna's trial attorney testified that several days before trial, Long told him, \"I\nam going to hurt you. I am not going to help you.\" The state postconviction court\nfound the attorney discussed the possibility of Long testifying with Zinna and he chose\nnot to call Long as a witness as a matter of trial strategy. The court also heard Long's\ntestimony and found he lacked credibility.\n\n       On appeal, Zinna concedes the record supports the attorney's testimony at the\npostconviction proceeding, but argues Long's testimony there rendered counsel's\ndecision not to call Long at trial unreasonable. We conclude the state courts did not\nunreasonably apply federal law in denying Zinna postconviction relief because the\nperformance of Zinna's attorney was not deficient. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2554(d)(1);\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689-90 (1984). Besides, Zinna cannot\nestablish the allegedly deficient performance prejudiced him, given the overwhelming\nevidence of his guilt. See id. at 694-95. We thus affirm the district court's denial of\nZinna's habeas petition.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n      **\n         The Honorable Jean C.
