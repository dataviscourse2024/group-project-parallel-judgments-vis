From the night of July 1, 2015, to the early\n\nhours of the morning on July 2, Derrell Fisher, the defendant,\n\nand Epshod Jeune, his codefendant,1 engaged in a scheme to rob\n\nwomen they found advertising sexual services on a website\n\n(Backpage).    After one successful robbery of a victim at a\n\nWoburn hotel, the defendant and Jeune traveled to a second hotel\n\nin Burlington (Burlington hotel), where a second victim was shot\n\nafter she began to scream for help.    The defendant was convicted\n\nof murder in the first degree based on a theory of felony-\n\nmurder, among other charges.\n\n     On appeal, the defendant argues that his motion to suppress\n\nwas denied erroneously; the judge erred in dismissing two jurors\n\nfrom the venire; a police officer improperly identified the\n\ndefendant in a video recording at trial, which was exacerbated\n\nby the prosecutor&#x27;s statements and the judge&#x27;s instructions; the\n\nevidence was insufficient for his murder conviction; the judge&#x27;s\n\ninstructions to the jury in response to a question regarding\n\nthird prong malice was incorrect; and the prosecutor&#x27;s closing\n\nargument misstated the evidence.    For these claimed errors, the\n\ndefendant requests that the court reduce his verdict pursuant to\n\n\n     1   The two were tried together but have separate appeals.\n\f                                                                        3\n\n\nG. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, or order a retrial.      We hold that the\n\nofficer&#x27;s identification testimony was admitted improperly, but\n\nthat its admission did not prejudice the defendant.        Concluding\n\nthat there was no other error, we affirm the defendant&#x27;s\n\nconvictions.2\n\n     1.   Background.   a.   Facts.   i.   The crimes.   Because the\n\ndefendant disputes the sufficiency of the evidence for his\n\nconviction of murder in the first degree, we recite the facts in\n\ndetail, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\n\nCommonwealth v. Oberle, 476 Mass. 539, 540 (2017).\n\n     A.   Sanisha Johnson.   On the evening of July 1, 2015,\n\nSanisha Johnson was in her Burlington hotel room.        That night,\n\nJohnson had posted a listing on Backpage for sexual services,\n\nwhich included her cell phone number.\n\n     Sometime after midnight on July 2, a couple staying in room\n\n116 heard knocking at their door, to which they did not respond.\n\nSoon after, from a nearby room they heard a woman call out,\n\n&quot;Help me.   Help me,&quot; and a loud bang, followed by silence.\n\nOther guests also heard cries for help and a loud bang at around\n\n\n\n\n     2 We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by the Boston\nUniversity Center for Antiracist Research, Massachusetts\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Felony Murder\nElimination Project, National Council for Incarcerated and\nFormerly Incarcerated Women and Girls, Kat Albrecht, and The\nSentencing Project; and by the New England Innocence Project and\nThe Innocence Project.\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nhalf past midnight, two of whom identified the sound as a\n\ngunshot.\n\n    A hotel employee, Cherin Townsend, heard a loud bang from\n\ninside the building on July 2, 2015, between 12:20 and 12:30\n\nA.M., and received a telephone call informing her that somebody\n\nheard gunshots.   After several telephone calls from guests,\n\nTownsend walked to the front desk and called police.\n\n    Sergeant Daniel Hanafin of the Burlington police\n\ndepartment, the officer in charge on July 2, 2015, at 12:30\n\nA.M., responded to a telephone call from the hotel, along with\n\nseveral other officers.   On entering the hotel, officers spoke\n\nto individuals gathered in the lobby and to Townsend.   After\n\nlooking through the hallway at issue, officers began calling\n\neach occupied room in the corridor and asking occupants to come\n\nout into the hallway.   After knocking on the doors of rooms\n\nwhose residents the officers were unable to connect with by\n\ntelephone, the only room without a response was Johnson&#x27;s room.\n\n    Hanafin and Sergeant Tim McDonough entered Johnson&#x27;s room\n\nto conduct a well-being check.   Immediately, they noticed blood\n\ndroplets on the floor just inside the doorway.   Johnson was\n\nlying in an odd position on the floor, partially face down and\n\non her side, with blood around her.   Hanafin noticed a gunshot\n\nwound on her side.   Blood smears were located by the telephone\n\non the nightstand and on the bedspread.   The telephone cord was\n\f                                                                       5\n\n\nstretched out under Johnson&#x27;s body.     Officers suspected that\n\nJohnson was deceased, which was confirmed by emergency medical\n\nresponders.\n\n    After they found Johnson, Detective James Tigges arrived at\n\nthe hotel at around 4 or 5 A.M. and secured the exit and\n\nentrance at the wing of the building closest to the street.\n\nTigges retrieved a wallet found by a guest at the front desk,\n\nwhich contained a tissue and a receipt from a store in Florida.\n\nTigges also searched Backpage and located Johnson&#x27;s\n\nadvertisement.      When he called the number listed, Johnson&#x27;s cell\n\nphone in the hotel room began to ring.      Upon examining Johnson&#x27;s\n\ncell phone records, officers observed a cell phone number ending\n\nin 9575 was used to contact Johnson at around the time of the\n\n911 call (9575 number).\n\n    B.    Emily.3    From July 1 to July 2, 2015, Emily was staying\n\nat a hotel in Woburn (Woburn hotel).      At that time, Emily was\n\nworking as an escort and advertising for her services on\n\nBackpage.     On July 1, before the shooting of Johnson, she was\n\ncontacted by someone using the 9575 number to ask about her\n\navailability that evening; she made an appointment to meet with\n\n\n\n\n    3   A pseudonym.\n\f                                                                         6\n\n\nthe caller.4    She received a text message at 11:52 P.M. from the\n\n9575 number asking for her room number, which she provided.\n\n     Emily heard a knock on her door and looked through the\n\npeephole in her door to see a young Black man with his hair in\n\nshoulder-length braids and wearing a baseball cap.     As soon as\n\nshe opened the door to let him in, a second man barged into her\n\nroom along with the first man, pushing Emily into the closet\n\narea behind the door and grabbing her face.     The second man also\n\nwas Black, had medium-toned skin and big brown eyes, and\n\nappeared to be very angry.5    At the same time that the second man\n\ngrabbed her, he put a gun to her forehead.     She believed that\n\nthe gun they used was black and not a revolver, and that both\n\nthe men were about her height, five feet, four inches tall.        She\n\ndid not remember seeing tattoos or facial hair on either man.6\n\n     The second man said to Emily, &quot;If you scream, believe me, I\n\ncan scream louder.    Where da money at?   I&#x27;m not playin&#x27;.   Where\n\nda money at?&quot;    The first man, who had braids, was standing\n\n\n\n\n     4 The 9575 number contacted her at 10:49 P.M. on July 1,\n2015, and they had additional telephone calls at 11:21 and 11:53\nP.M.\n\n     5 In comparison, she believed that the first man seemed\nintimidated by the second man and &quot;empathetic&quot; toward her,\ndespite the fact that it was clear that the use of the gun was\napparent to the first man who took her property.\n\n     6 The defendant had tattoos on his right arm and a small\namount of facial hair. He is approximately six feet tall.\n\f                                                                    7\n\n\nbeside the second man at his left.     Emily told them that she\n\nwould give them her money, and the second man kept the gun to\n\nher side as she went to her dresser.    When she opened a drawer\n\nto remove her purse, she remembered that she had hidden her cash\n\nunder the table between the two beds.    The gun remained pointed\n\nat her as she walked toward the table.     The first man was with\n\nthem between the two beds.\n\n      When she went to reach under the table to get the money,\n\nthe second man with the gun moved her away from the area and\n\nforced her to the front of the bed and to the floor; he directed\n\nthe first man to look for the money while the second man kept\n\nthe gun on Emily.   The first man grabbed the money, in the sum\n\nof $700.\n\n      They brought her purse over to the bed and looked through\n\nit.   In her wallet, she had medical, identification, and Social\n\nSecurity cards belonging to her and her children, and receipts\n\nfrom her neighborhood stores in Florida.     In her purse she had\n\ntwo money orders.   When the first man found the money orders, he\n\nasked the second man whether they should take them, and the\n\nsecond man responded, &quot;No.   Leave those.&quot;   As the gun was\n\ntrained to her head and she was on the floor, the first man, at\n\nthe direction of the second man, ransacked her room, flipping\n\nover the mattresses, looking in the bathroom, and trying to get\n\ninto the adjoining room through a locked door.    They took\n\f                                                                      8\n\n\nEmily&#x27;s marijuana from one of her dresser drawers.     One man\n\nasked her, &quot;Where da work at?,&quot; which she took to be a request\n\nfor cocaine.   She told them that she did not have any.   As they\n\nwere leaving, the second man with the gun told her he would\n\n&quot;holler at&quot; her.   The men exited to the right, which led her to\n\nbelieve they were going out the back entrance to avoid the\n\nlobby.\n\n    Although she called the front desk immediately after this\n\nincident, when the clerk answered Emily hung up because she\n\nneeded to continue working.   For that same reason, she did not\n\nreport the incident to police right away.     Later, while still in\n\nWoburn, she heard about Johnson&#x27;s murder.\n\n    When she tried to extend her stay, the manager confronted\n\nher with her Backpage advertisement and told her that she had to\n\nleave.   She traveled to Maine and had a flight scheduled to\n\nreturn to her Florida home on July 4, 2015.     On the evening of\n\nJuly 3, she called the Burlington police department and reported\n\nwhat had happened to her at the Woburn hotel.\n\n    C.   Sarah.7   From July 1 through July 2, 2015,   Sarah was\n\nstaying at a hotel in Saugus (Saugus hotel).     On July 1, Sarah\n\n\n    7  A pseudonym. No charges were filed against the defendants\nin relation to the incident involving Sarah, but evidence of its\noccurrence was admitted to show the defendants&#x27; state of mind,\nintent, plan, pattern of operation, common scheme, and identity,\nover the defendants&#x27; objection. The judge instructed the jury\nthat the evidence was not to be considered for propensity or to\n\f                                                                       9\n\n\nhad an advertisement on Backpage, to which she received a\n\nresponse.   At 10:55 P.M., there was a call from the 9575 number\n\nto Sarah&#x27;s cell phone.    There were two more calls placed from\n\nthe 9575 number to Sarah&#x27;s cell phone at 11:24 and 11:30 P.M.\n\nAfter she told the caller her room number, she went to the door\n\nto admit him.   When he knocked on the door and she looked\n\nthrough the peephole, she said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t do Black\n\nguys.&quot;    The man at the door responded, &quot;I&#x27;m not Black, I&#x27;m\n\nSpanish.&quot;   Sarah testified that the man had braids and wore a\n\nhat and baggy clothing.    She did not let him in because he &quot;just\n\ndidn&#x27;t look right to&quot; her.\n\n    ii.     The investigation.   In Johnson&#x27;s room, police did not\n\nfind a shell casing.    They did find her wallet, which contained\n\n$1,875.\n\n    On July 2, 2015, State police Trooper Sean O&#x27;Brien returned\n\nto the Burlington hotel to retrieve its video surveillance.\n\nBecause the video system was unable to play back the footage at\n\nthat time, he went to an office building across the street to\n\nsee whether he could obtain footage from that location.      O&#x27;Brien\n\ndiscovered that a security camera on the property pointed\n\ndirectly at the street and included the hotel entrance.      Aware\n\nthat witnesses heard a loud noise at around 12:20 to 12:25 A.M.\n\n\n\nprove that the defendants were of bad character, but only for\nthe limited purpose stated.\n\f                                                                    10\n\n\non July 2, O&#x27;Brien watched the video recording backward from\n\nwhen police arrived at the hotel.    He observed that at 12:14\n\nA.M. that day, a light colored, four-door sedan missing a hubcap\n\ndrove toward the hotel.8   At 12:23 A.M., this car took a left\n\nturn from the hotel parking lot and traveled in front of the\n\noffice building&#x27;s security camera, revealing that the front\n\nright quarter panel was a different color from the rest of the\n\ncar.\n\n       Later that day, O&#x27;Brien was able to view video footage from\n\nthe Burlington hotel.    In the hotel video recording, as viewed\n\nfrom the front and side door cameras, a Black man wearing black\n\ncargo-style pants, a sweatshirt with thick horizontal stripes,\n\nand a hat with a team logo on the front was seen walking in the\n\nfront door to the lobby and looking at his &quot;smart phone&quot; at\n\napproximately 12:19 A.M.    At approximately the same time, a man\n\nwearing a black hooded sweatshirt, a hat, and dark pants or\n\njeans walked in the side door and peered in, seemingly waiting\n\nand watching for something through the glass, and ultimately\n\nentering less than a minute later.    At approximately 12:23 A.M.,\n\nboth men were observed running from the side door.    The man in\n\nthe striped sweatshirt had visible thin braids, approximately\n\nshoulder length.\n\n\n\n       We have independently reviewed the relevant video footage\n       8\n\nas part of our review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\n     There were several text messages and calls between Johnson\n\nand the 9575 number on July 1, 2015, until 12:19 A.M. on July 2.\n\nAfter speaking with Robert Dingess (a hotel resident) and\n\nlooking at his cell phone, police learned that Dingess had been\n\nfriendly with a hotel employee he knew as Remy.   Dingess later\n\nidentified Jeune as Remy.   The original telephone number that he\n\nhad in his contacts for Jeune was the 9575 number.9\n\n     At approximately 12:30 A.M. on July 2, and continuing\n\nthrough the early hours that morning, the 9575 number contacted\n\nDingess asking what had happened at the hotel, whether someone\n\nhad been shot, and whether news reporters were present.   At 3:07\n\nA.M., someone using the 9575 number sent Dingess a text message\n\nto delete that number and the user&#x27;s messages, that the user\n\nwould send Dingess a text message from a new number the next\n\nday, and that &quot;shit&#x27;s going to be hot.&quot;   At 4:55 A.M., Dingess\n\ngot a text message from a telephone number ending in 8819, which\n\nwas Jeune&#x27;s new number.\n\n     As a result of this analysis of the records to determine\n\nwho contacted the 9575 number, officers went to a house on\n\nWildmere Avenue in Burlington at 10:40 A.M. on July 3.    O&#x27;Brien\n\nand Burlington police Detective Thomas Carlson both went to the\n\nWildmere address in separate, unmarked cars and wearing plain\n\n\n     9 Additionally, a friend of Jeune testified that she had\nused the 9575 number to contact him.\n\f                                                                     12\n\n\nclothes.    Parked in the driveway was a gold-colored four-door\n\nToyota Camry that was missing its left rear hubcap and had a\n\ndark front right quarter panel.     The Camry appeared to be &quot;an\n\nexact match&quot; to the one that O&#x27;Brien had observed in the office\n\nbuilding security camera video footage.     They learned from\n\ndispatch that the registered owner of the Camry was Jeune.\n\n    Carlson and O&#x27;Brien set up surveillance down the street\n\nfrom the address with other officers, choosing not to park in\n\nfront of the house so as to avoid detection.     At some point, the\n\nCamry was driven away without drawing the attention of the\n\nofficers.   After waiting for some time to see whether the Camry\n\nreturned, police put out a &quot;be on the lookout&quot; for the car.     At\n\napproximately 6 P.M., they learned that the car was in\n\nWinchester, stopped at a fast-food restaurant drive-through\n\nwindow.\n\n    O&#x27;Brien took about a minute to arrive; on arrival, he\n\nobserved three Black men in the car.     Approximately five\n\nuniformed police officers from both Winchester and Woburn were\n\nin the parking lot when he arrived.     The Woburn officers left\n\nwhen O&#x27;Brien and Carlson arrived.    As time went on, additional\n\ndetectives arrived, including Sergeant Bruce O&#x27;Rourke from the\n\nState police and McDonough and Tigges.\n\n    O&#x27;Brien initially had a conversation with the driver of the\n\ncar, Jeune.   The defendant was the front seat passenger, and\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\nRomane Price was in the right rear seat.   O&#x27;Brien informed Jeune\n\nthat they were interested in a car similar to his and told him\n\nthat he was not under arrest and was free to go.   Jeune\n\nresponded that he knew he was free to go, agreed to step out of\n\nthe car, and walked to a grassy curbed area in the parking lot\n\nto have a discussion with O&#x27;Brien.   After being asked where he\n\nwas on July 1 and July 2, Jeune responded that he was at a\n\ngirlfriend&#x27;s house in Boston; according to him, the Camry was\n\nparked there all night.   He would not divulge the girlfriend&#x27;s\n\nname or address.   During their conversation, Jeune informed them\n\nthat he worked at a hotel in Waltham, and that he previously had\n\nworked at the Burlington hotel.   Jeune stated that he lived at\n\nthe Wildmere address with his mother and another girlfriend.\n\nThe conversation lasted from three to four minutes.\n\n    O&#x27;Rourke approached the car and told the defendant and\n\nPrice that the car matched the description of a car used in a\n\nserious crime that occurred on Wednesday night, and that the\n\noccupants of the car might have had nothing to do with that\n\ncrime but that the officers had a need to investigate the car.\n\nThe defendant was asked to step out of the car, and he was pat\n\nfrisked.   When O&#x27;Brien approached the defendant, he already was\n\nout of the car and standing toward the rear of it.    Over\n\nobjection, O&#x27;Brien testified that he recognized the defendant to\n\nbe &quot;the Black male who walked in through the front door of&quot; the\n\f                                                                    14\n\n\nBurlington hotel.     The defendant told O&#x27;Brien that he lived in\n\nBoston and worked at Logan Airport.    He said he was working\n\nthere on July 1 from 11 P.M. until 6:30 A.M. on July 2.       Later,\n\nthis was shown to be false; he worked the night before and the\n\nnight after, but not July 1 to July 2.     The defendant provided\n\nO&#x27;Brien with his cell phone number, ending in 0046 (0046\n\nnumber).    O&#x27;Brien noticed that the defendant&#x27;s cell phone number\n\nappeared on the 9575 number records.     O&#x27;Brien seized the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s cell phone as evidence and, after a conversation of\n\nfrom three to four minutes, told the defendant that he was free\n\nto go.10\n\n     The car was seized as evidence and towed to the Burlington\n\npolice department.     After their brief conversations with the\n\nofficers, Jeune, the defendant, and Price went into the\n\nrestaurant to eat.     O&#x27;Brien was there for a total of\n\napproximately forty minutes.    A local freelance photographer\n\ntook photographs of the encounter, which were admitted in\n\nevidence at trial.\n\n     O&#x27;Brien first heard about Emily on the evening of July 3,\n\n2015, after he had the interaction with the codefendants and\n\nPrice in the parking lot.    Emily spoke with Carlson after the\n\nstop.     That night, police obtained search warrants for the\n\n\n     10The defendant&#x27;s cell phone was not searched until police\nsecured a search warrant.\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\nresidences of both the defendant and Jeune.     In the early\n\nmorning hours on July 4, officers executing the search warrant\n\nat the defendant&#x27;s home seized baseball hats, a sweatshirt, and\n\ndark colored pants from the defendant&#x27;s home.    O&#x27;Brien testified\n\nthat the hats and the sweatshirt taken from the defendant&#x27;s home\n\nwere not those seen in the video recording, and that he could\n\nnot say that the pants they seized were the pants in the\n\nrecording with one hundred percent certainty.\n\n     At Jeune&#x27;s address, in a Jeep registered to Jeune that had\n\na flat tire, officers located Social Security cards, health\n\ncards, debit cards, Medicaid cards, and identification cards\n\nbelonging to Emily and her children.   They also found a bag with\n\nammunition in it.11   In Jeune&#x27;s house, they found a baseball\n\nteam&#x27;s hat with stickers on the brim, a box for an Alcatel brand\n\ncell phone, various items of clothing, cash, and a keycard that\n\nmatched the brand of the Burlington hotel.\n\n     When officers searched the Camry, they found, among other\n\nitems, two cell phones (an Alcatel cell phone and a Kyocera\n\nbrand cell phone) and a hotel employee nametag with the name\n\n&quot;Remy.&quot;   Police also did reenactments of the Camry being driven\n\n\n\n\n     11A State police trooper assigned to the firearms\nidentification section opined that the spent projectile\nrecovered from Johnson&#x27;s body was .38 caliber. He testified\nthat the ammunition recovered from Jeune&#x27;s house appeared to be\n.38 special caliber designed for use in a revolver.\n\f                                                                    16\n\n\nto the Woburn hotel and the Burlington hotel, and the video\n\nrecordings of the reenactments were entered in evidence.\n\n     State police Trooper Edward Keefe examined the Alcatel cell\n\nphone (Alcatel), with a telephone number ending in 9096 (9096\n\nnumber), and found that it had been used on July 2, 2015,\n\nnumerous times throughout the day to search for articles about\n\nthe shooting at the Burlington hotel.    Keefe also found that it\n\nhad been used to view Backpage 199 times, including on July 1.\n\nThe Alcatel was used to visit Backpage advertisements for Emily,\n\nSarah, and Johnson on July 1 through July 2.    The Alcatel was\n\nused to send several text messages to Bethzaida Hernandez, a\n\nworker at the Burlington hotel, the morning after the shooting\n\nasking about the incident.12   Also on July 2, at around 12:30\n\nP.M., the Alcatel was used to send a text message to a contact\n\nnamed &quot;Mama Bear&quot; stating, &quot;Its on da news now.&quot;    The text\n\nmessages continued, &quot;Delete any n all text or phones kalls from\n\nmy flip. N this message.&quot;   Right after the Alcatel was used to\n\nsend a text message to Mama Bear, at 12:36 P.M. the user sent a\n\ntext message to the defendant, &quot;Ima kall u in a min.   Its on da\n\nnews.&quot;    At 12:37 P.M., the Alcatel was used to send another text\n\nmessage to Mama Bear, &quot;I don&#x27;t wanna be here.   They didn&#x27;t even\n\n\n\n\n     12Hernandez testified at trial and identified the coworker\nshe knew as &quot;Remy&quot; to be Jeune. She said that he asked about\nthe murder during their conversation.\n\f                                                                     17\n\n\nsearch the room yet.&quot;   At 1:40 P.M., the Alcatel was used to\n\nsend a text message to Mama Bear asking, &quot;Did u Google it?&quot;     At\n\n1:42 P.M., Mama Bear sent a text message to the Alcatel, &quot;I&#x27;m\n\nbout to now.&quot;   At 2:28 P.M., Mama Bear sent another text\n\nmessage:   &quot;No suspects.&quot;13\n\n    Someone using the Alcaltel contacted the defendant&#x27;s cell\n\nphone number (listed in the Alcatel&#x27;s contacts list as &quot;Staxx&quot;)\n\nninety-eight times.   The defendant&#x27;s cell phone was used to\n\ncontact the Alcatel (listed in the defendant&#x27;s contacts list as\n\n&quot;Eps&quot;) at 10:44 and 11:48 A.M. on July 2, and someone using the\n\nAlcatel called the defendant at 10:59 A.M. that same day.     At\n\n12:44 P.M., after the Alcatel was used to send the text message\n\nthat the user would call regarding what was on the news, the\n\nAlcatel was used to call the defendant.   The defendant called\n\nthe Alcatel at 1:08 and 1:09 P.M.   The last contact between the\n\nAlcatel and the defendant&#x27;s cell phone was on July 3 at\n\napproximately 1:14 P.M.\n\n    The defendant&#x27;s cell phone also received an incoming call\n\non July 3 at 2:19 P.M. and was used to make an outgoing call to\n\nthe telephone number ending in 8819 at 2:22 P.M.   This was the\n\nthird telephone number connected to Jeune; Dingess received a\n\n\n\n\n    13 There were further text messages between Mama Bear and\nthe Alcatel regarding the news throughout the day.\n\f                                                                    18\n\n\ntext message from this number stating that it was the new cell\n\nphone number for &quot;Remy.&quot;\n\n    On July 1, 2015, the defendant and the 9575 number had\n\ncontact at 12:08 and 8:48 P.M.     On June 12, the defendant was\n\nasked by another individual what was &quot;Eps&quot;&#x27;s cell phone number:\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s cell phone was used to send a text message with\n\nthe 9575 number in response to the inquiry.    On July 3, after\n\nthe shooting of Johnson, when the same individual asked the\n\ndefendant for the cell phone number again, the defendant gave\n\nthe 9096 number.\n\n    There was no outgoing activity on the defendant&#x27;s cell\n\nphone on July 1, 2015, from 11:56 P.M. to July 2 at 12:09 A.M.\n\nAgain from 12:09 through 12:35 A.M., there was no outgoing\n\nactivity.   State police mapped the available cell site location\n\ninformation (CSLI) for the defendant&#x27;s cell phone.     The CSLI on\n\nJuly 1 at 8:54 P.M. put the cell phone and its user at 1010\n\nMassachusetts Avenue in Boston.    On July 2, just past 1 A.M.,\n\nCSLI placed the cell phone near Hyde Park Avenue in the\n\nRoslindale section of Boston.     At 1:08 A.M., it placed the cell\n\nphone on Brookway Road in Roslindale.    At 1:09 A.M., CSLI put\n\nthe cell phone on Hyde Park Avenue, by the Forest Hills transit\n\nstation.    At 1:26 A.M., CSLI showed the cell phone to be near\n\nthe intersection of Morton Street and Blue Hill Avenue in the\n\nMattapan section of Boston.    The window of time in between 8:54\n\f                                                                   19\n\n\nP.M. on July 1 and 1 A.M. on July 2 was not produced by the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s cell phone provider.\n\n    The CSLI for the Alcatel put the cell phone in Saugus at\n\n11:30 P.M. on July 1, the time at which the Camry was seen at\n\nthe Saugus hotel.     The CSLI jumped ahead to 3:13 A.M. on July 2,\n\nwhen the Alcatel used a tower on Massachusetts Avenue in Boston.\n\nAlso at 3:13 A.M., it used a tower on Blue Hill Avenue in Boston\n\nto receive a text message.    Between 3:30 and 3:45 A.M., the CSLI\n\nplaced the Alcatel near Neponset Avenue in the Dorchester\n\nsection of Boston.     At 5:07, 7:27, 8:46, 9:19, and 9:21 A.M.,\n\nthe Alcatel used a tower located on Mountain Road in Burlington.\n\n    According to CSLI, the cell phone associated with the 9575\n\nnumber was in the area of 500 Morton Street in Dorchester at\n\n9:40 P.M. on July 1.    At 9:44 P.M., the 9575 number activated a\n\ntower on Cummins Highway in Roslindale.    The 9575 number also\n\nactivated towers in Saugus, Woburn, and Burlington at the times\n\nit was being used to communicate with the cell phones of Sarah,\n\nEmily, and Johnson.     On July 2, from 12:30 to 12:38 A.M., it\n\nactivated towers in Woburn, Stoneham, and the Charlestown\n\nsection of Boston.     At 12:42 A.M., its CSLI disclosed its\n\nlocation in the area of Traveler Street in Boston.     In going\n\nthrough the 9575 number records, the last call made from the\n\n9575 number was at 1:35 A.M. on July 2, 2015.\n\f                                                                   20\n\n\n       After the search of the defendant&#x27;s home, on July 4,\n\nO&#x27;Brien watched video footage from the Woburn hotel from July 1\n\nto July 2, 2015.14    On July 1, 2015, at approximately 11:52 P.M.,\n\nthe video recording showed a car being driven around the parking\n\nlot.    The car was a light-colored four-door sedan missing its\n\nleft rear hubcap and with a different color gasoline cap cover\n\n(which he noticed on the Camry during the stop), appearing also\n\nto be a match to the car in the office building security camera\n\nvideo recording.     The car was driven around the hotel several\n\ntimes before it stopped, and a Black man got out of the car and\n\nwalked into the hotel at approximately 11:54 P.M.     The man\n\nwalking into the hotel was wearing a hat with a baseball cap\n\nwith an &quot;A&#x27;s&quot; logo on the front, a black sweatshirt, a white\n\nshirt with a design on the front, and dark pants.    The man\n\nwalked over to a side door and appeared to manipulate it before\n\nwalking out the front door while using a cell phone.     The car\n\nthen was driven to the side door; two men got out of the car --\n\nthe same man who previously had manipulated the side door, along\n\nwith a second man who walked to the side door and went into the\n\n\n\n\n       Also on July 4, Carlson and two other police officers\n       14\n\npicked up Emily in Maine. When Emily was shown a photographic\narray that included Jeune (and not the defendant), she suggested\nthat someone who was not Jeune may have been involved. She\nidentified the wallet and the receipt found by police as having\nbeen stolen from her.\n\f                                                                  21\n\n\nhotel at approximately 11:58 P.M.15    The second man was wearing a\n\nstriped sweatshirt, black pants, and a hat, and had his hair in\n\nbraids.   The car was parked, and the two men came out of the\n\nside door at approximately 12:05 P.M. after coming from the side\n\nstairwell area.   As the car was driven away, the different color\n\nfront quarter panel was visible.   Both men appear to be the same\n\nmen who appeared in the Burlington hotel video recording.\n\n     O&#x27;Brien also observed video footage from the Saugus hotel\n\nwhere Sarah stayed on July 1 and July 2.    On this video footage,\n\nhe observed the same Camry.   O&#x27;Brien observed that the same men\n\nwho appeared in the Burlington hotel and Woburn hotel footage\n\nwere in the Saugus hotel video recording.    O&#x27;Brien identified\n\nthe man wearing the striped sweatshirt as the defendant.    At\n\napproximately 11:32 P.M. on July 1, the man wearing the striped\n\nsweatshirt walked in the front door of the hotel and to a side\n\ndoor, where he let the second man in, and both men ascended the\n\nstairs.   A little more than five minutes later, the two men came\n\nout the side door with their hoods up, and the Camry was driven\n\naway.\n\n     The defendant&#x27;s girlfriend at the time of the crimes\n\ntestified that she knew Jeune as a friend of the defendant, and\n\nthat Jeune drove a brown or tan car.    She braided the\n\n\n     15The car then was driven off, suggesting a third\nindividual was involved.\n\f                                                                  22\n\n\ndefendant&#x27;s hair at that time, and he had a &quot;bunch&quot; of single,\n\nchin length &quot;unattached braids.&quot;    She had seen the defendant\n\nwith a gun on one occasion in early to mid-May 2015.\n\n    b.   Procedural history.    On July 5, 2015, the defendant\n\nagreed to accompany officers to the Woburn police station, where\n\nhe was arrested.    The defendant was indicted on charges of\n\nmurder in the first degree, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1; attempted armed\n\nrobbery, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6; unlawful possession of a firearm,\n\nG. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a); armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17; home\n\ninvasion, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C; and armed assault in a dwelling,\n\nG. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A.\n\n    On July 18, 2016, the defendant filed motions to suppress\n\nstatements of the defendant, evidence recovered during the stop\n\nof the Camry and from the defendant&#x27;s home, and Emily&#x27;s\n\nidentifications of the defendants as she saw them in a news\n\narticle online.    The motion to suppress Emily&#x27;s identifications\n\nwas allowed, but the other motions to suppress were denied.\n\n    A jury trial was held in November 2017.     The defendant was\n\nfound guilty of murder in the first degree on a theory of\n\nfelony-murder and of attempted armed robbery of Johnson, guilty\n\nof the lesser included offense of unarmed robbery of Emily, and\n\nnot guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm, home invasion,\n\nand armed assault in a dwelling.    The defendant was sentenced to\n\na mandatory term of life in prison for the murder conviction and\n\f                                                                      23\n\n\na concurrent term of from five to ten years in prison for the\n\nunarmed robbery conviction.\n\n     2.   Discussion.    a.   Motion to suppress statements.    The\n\ndefendant argues that he was in custody when police asked him\n\nquestions about his whereabouts at around the time of the\n\ncrimes; therefore, he should have been given his Miranda\n\nwarnings.   The Commonwealth argues that the defendant was not in\n\ncustody when he was questioned.\n\n     We discuss the facts as found by the motion judge,\n\nsupplemented only by uncontroverted evidence from witnesses\n\ncredited by the motion judge.      Commonwealth v. Privette, 491\n\nMass. 501, 518 (2023).    The motion judge found that, at 5:58\n\nP.M. on the day of the stop, Officer Edward Chisholm of the\n\nWoburn police department parked his cruiser at an angle to\n\nprevent the Camry from exiting the drive-through and approached\n\nthe passenger&#x27;s side with his gun in his holster.16     After\n\nobserving Chisholm approach, Woburn police Detective John Walsh\n\napproached the car with his gun drawn in the &quot;low ready&quot;\n\nposition.   There was no evidence that the defendant, Jeune, or\n\n\n\n\n     16The defendant does not challenge any factual findings by\nthe motion judge, except that police never conveyed to the\ndefendant that he was a suspect.\n\f                                                                    24\n\n\nPrice saw Chisholm with his weapon out of his holster.17\n\nChisholm &quot;calmly&quot; told the occupants of the car that he needed\n\ntheir identifications, and that the car may have been involved\n\nin a crime; the defendant, Jeune, and Price were cooperative.\n\n     O&#x27;Brien and Carlson arrived at the fast-food restaurant\n\nsoon after 6 P.M.    There were as many as thirteen officers from\n\ndifferent agencies at various times, but a large portion of\n\nthese officers left the scene or were standing near the\n\nperimeter of the parking lot.18   Walsh and Chisholm left the\n\nscene minutes after O&#x27;Brien and Carlson arrived.19\n\n     O&#x27;Brien asked Jeune to get out of the car and told him that\n\nhe (O&#x27;Brien) wanted to speak with him regarding a similar car\n\nand an investigation in Burlington.    They spoke as Jeune sat on\n\na curb in an area away from the car.    O&#x27;Rourke was present for\n\nthis conversation, and O&#x27;Brien told Jeune he was not under\n\narrest and was free to leave, which Jeune acknowledged by\n\nstating, &quot;I know.&quot;   He was not provided with Miranda warnings,\n\n\n     17Price, who testified at the hearing on the motion to\nsuppress, said that the officer approaching the car had his hand\non his gun, but did not have his gun out.\n\n     18Winchester police stood by on the main street as a\nuniformed presence as the stop was conducted in their\njurisdiction, but they were not near the car.\n\n     19A photograph taken by a freelance photographer depicted a\npolice car leaving the scene while an officer, presumably\nCarlson, stood next to the defendant at the passenger&#x27;s side\ndoor.\n\f                                                                  25\n\n\nbut ultimately ended the conversation when he was asked whether\n\nofficers could search the car, and he responded in the negative,\n\ntelling the officers, &quot;I think I need a lawyer.&quot;    Jeune was then\n\ntold that they would be seizing the car, but that he was free to\n\nleave.\n\n    Carlson, O&#x27;Rourke, and O&#x27;Brien all noticed that the\n\ndefendant looked similar to the Black male with braids depicted\n\nin the Burlington hotel surveillance video recording.     O&#x27;Rourke\n\ntold the defendant and Price that police were interested in the\n\ncar as it potentially had been involved in a serious crime where\n\nweapons were used, and the defendant was asked to step out of\n\nthe car.     O&#x27;Rourke asked the defendant whether he had any\n\nweapons on him, and the defendant said that he did not.\n\nO&#x27;Rourke conducted a patfrisk of the defendant at the rear of\n\nthe car; Carlson had his hand on the defendant, and a few other\n\nofficers were off to the left out of arm&#x27;s reach of the\n\ndefendant.    The defendant was told that he was not under arrest,\n\nand he was not provided with Miranda warnings.     O&#x27;Rourke\n\ntestified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that the\n\ndefendant was not free to leave until the patfrisk was complete,\n\nand O&#x27;Rourke did not tell the defendant that he was free to\n\nleave after he concluded the patfrisk.\n\n    When Carlson and O&#x27;Brien spoke to the defendant in a grassy\n\narea to the right of the pavement near the entrance, however,\n\f                                                                   26\n\n\nthey advised him that he was free to leave.   The defendant\n\nresponded, &quot;O.K.,&quot; and proceeded to answer the officers&#x27;\n\nquestions about his whereabouts on the day of the crime, his\n\nhome address, and his telephone number.   His cell phone was\n\nseized, and the car was towed.   The defendant, Jeune, and Price\n\nwent into the restaurant and were allowed to leave.   The motion\n\njudge found that the fact that the defendant and Jeune had\n\nbecome suspects was not conveyed to them during the stop.20\n\n     Price, the defendant&#x27;s cousin, testified that he twice\n\nasked officers whether he could leave, and that he was told in\n\nresponse that he could leave when the officers were finished.\n\nThe motion judge found it &quot;noteworthy&quot; that in none of the\n\nphotographs taken of the encounter were officers seen standing\n\nin the area where Price stood behind the car.21\n\n     &quot;In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept\n\nthe judge&#x27;s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error &#x27;but\n\nconduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and\n\nconclusions of law.&#x27;&quot;   Commonwealth v. Medina, 485 Mass. 296,\n\n\n\n\n     20Connolly, who also was present to speak with the\ndefendant, testified: &quot;In my eight years in the police, I do[\nnot] think that I[ have] ever seen a more casual environment for\nconsiderably such a serious incident.&quot;\n\n     21The motion judge rejected Price&#x27;s testimony that he was\nsubjected to a patfrisk.\n\f                                                                    27\n\n\n299-300 (2020), quoting Commonwealth v. Cawthron, 479 Mass. 612,\n\n616 (2018).\n\n     When a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation,\n\nMiranda warnings are required.22   Medina, 485 Mass. at 300.   &quot;A\n\nperson is in custody whenever he is &#x27;deprived of his freedom of\n\naction in any significant way.&#x27;&quot;    Commonwealth v. DePeiza, 449\n\nMass. 367, 375 (2007), quoting Commonwealth v. Almonte, 444\n\nMass. 511, 517, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1040 (2005).    Two related\n\ninquiries inform the determination as to whether a suspect was\n\n&quot;in custody&quot; at the time of questioning:   &quot;first, what were the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given\n\nthose circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or\n\nshe was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and\n\nleave.&quot;   Medina, supra, quoting Thompson v.

Kirwan, 448 Mass. 304, 312 (2007) (defendant not\n\nin custody, &quot;although the defendant was not free to leave, [the]\n\n\n     22We agree with the motion judge that asking the defendant\nwhere he was on the night of the crimes was &quot;designed to elicit\nincriminatory responses from the defendant,&quot; and thus\nconstituted interrogation for purposes of Miranda.\n\f                                                                       28\n\n\ninterrogation was brief and in the nature of a preliminary\n\ninvestigation, and the defendant&#x27;s detention was minimal and\n\nsimilar to a Terry-type stop&quot;).\n\n    We recognize that &quot;[t]he custody and seizure inquiries\n\n. . . are not identical.&quot;     Commonwealth v. Evelyn, 485 Mass.\n\n691, 698 (2020).   The custody inquiry, for Miranda purposes,\n\n&quot;primarily protects the right against self-incrimination and the\n\nright to counsel under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the\n\nUnited States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts\n\nDeclaration of Rights.&quot;     Id.   Conversely, the seizure inquiry is\n\nconcerned with &quot;the right to be free from unreasonable seizures\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment and art. 14.&quot;      Id.   The inquiries\n\neach &quot;consider somewhat different questions.&quot;       Id.   Under both\n\ninquiries, however, the totality of the circumstances are\n\nconsidered, &quot;limited to the objective circumstances of the\n\nencounter,&quot; to determine whether a person has been compelled to\n\nengage with the police.     Id. at 698-699.   Here, the defendant\n\nargues specifically that he was in custody at the time of the\n\nencounter, rendering his statements unlawfully obtained.\n\n    A court considers, at a minimum, four factors when\n\ndetermining whether the circumstances surrounding an encounter\n\nsuggest that a defendant is in custody during an interrogation:\n\n    &quot;(1) the place of the interrogation; (2) whether the\n    officers have conveyed to the person being questioned any\n    belief or opinion that that person is a suspect; (3) the\n\f                                                                    29\n\n\n    nature of the interrogation, including whether the\n    interview was aggressive or, instead, informal and\n    influenced in its contours by the person being interviewed;\n    and (4) whether, at the time the incriminating statement\n    was made, the person was free to end the interview by\n    leaving the locus of the interrogation or by asking the\n    interrogator to leave, as evidenced by whether the\n    interview terminated with an arrest.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Groome, 435 Mass. 201, 211-212 (2001).      &quot;Rarely\n\nis any single factor conclusive.&quot;   Cawthron, 479 Mass. at 618,\n\nquoting Commonwealth v. Bryant, 390 Mass. 729, 737 (1984).        The\n\nGroome factors are not intended to be &quot;a straitjacket,&quot; and\n\n&quot;they do not limit the obligation of a court to consider all of\n\nthe circumstances that shed light on the custody analysis.&quot;\n\nMedina, 485 Mass. at 301.   Applying these factors in the\n\ncircumstances here, the defendant has not met his burden to show\n\nthat he was in custody when he made the incriminating statements\n\nto the officers.   See Cawthron, supra.\n\n    The interrogation took place at around 6 P.M. in a drive-\n\nthrough and parking lot area of a fast-food restaurant.     This\n\nenvironment, in itself, was not coercive.    See Cawthron, 479\n\nMass. at 618 (&quot;The detectives questioned the defendant in a\n\npublic parking lot, during the day, and the defendants were\n\nneither handcuffed nor otherwise physically restrained.      This\n\nenvironment was not police-dominated&quot;).     The car was blocked\n\nfrom exiting the drive-through by a cruiser on its initial stop,\n\nand officers had firearms visible, although there was no\n\f                                                                     30\n\n\nevidence that they were seen to be drawn.     The defendant was not\n\nhandcuffed, nor was Jeune.     Although the judge found that there\n\nwere as many thirteen officers at the stop at various times,\n\nmany officers left quickly after they arrived, or did not\n\ninteract with the suspects.     See Medina, 485 Mass. at 302 (and\n\ncases cited) (&quot;Although more officers arrived over the following\n\ntwo hours, it does not appear that they meaningfully restricted\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s freedom of movement within his home&quot;).     See also\n\nCommonwealth v. Alcala, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 49, 54 (2002)\n\n(&quot;Although some ten to fifteen local, State, and Federal police\n\nand other officers were in the general vicinity, and perhaps six\n\nor seven &#x27;converge[d]&#x27; on the three men at the building, no more\n\nthan two officers were with the defendant when he was\n\ninterrogated&quot;).\n\n    That the defendant was moved a short distance to be\n\nquestioned separately does not alter the conclusion.     &quot;[T]he act\n\nof separating defendants briefly for individual questioning does\n\nnot create an inherently coercive environment.&quot;     Cawthron, 479\n\nMass. at 619.     Contrast Commonwealth v. Coleman, 49 Mass. App.\n\nCt. 150, 154 (2000), quoting Commonwealth v. Gallati, 40 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 111, 113 (1996) (situation &quot;isolating and coercive&quot;\n\nwhere three police officers were deployed in small room with\n\npath to closed door &quot;shadowed by the questioner himself&quot;).\n\nWhere the questioning was very brief, the separation of the\n\f                                                                   31\n\n\ndefendant to the grassy area of the parking lot alone did not\n\nrender the environment a coercive one.\n\n    Whether the defendant was questioned in a police-dominated\n\narea, given the circumstances mentioned supra, is a close call.\n\nWe assume that he was questioned in such an area for the sake of\n\nour analysis and move on to discuss the other three Groome\n\nfactors.\n\n    We agree with the motion judge that the officers did not\n\nconvey to the defendant that he was a suspect in the murder\n\ninvestigation.   Even before being questioned by O&#x27;Brien,\n\nO&#x27;Rourke told the defendant and Price that the crime &quot;might have\n\nnothing to do with you but, if you don&#x27;t mind, just keep your\n\nhands on your lap.&quot;   The fact that O&#x27;Rourke asked the defendant\n\nto step out of the car and pat frisked him did not on its own\n\ncommunicate to the defendant that he was a suspect.    In fact,\n\nO&#x27;Rourke testified that he told the defendant, after asking\n\nwhether he had any weapons on him, &quot;I[ am] going to pat you down\n\nand make sure.   Is that okay with you?&quot;23   He testified that the\n\n\n    23 The fact that O&#x27;Rourke subjectively knew that the\ndefendant was not free to leave until he was frisked is not of\nimportance because that was not expressly communicated to the\ndefendant. See Medina, 485 Mass. at 303, quoting Commonwealth\nv. Morse, 427 Mass. 117, 123-124 (1998) (&quot;[S]ubjective beliefs\nheld by law enforcement officers are irrelevant in the\ndetermination whether a person being questioned is in custody\nfor purposes of the receipt of Miranda warnings, except to the\nextent that those beliefs influence the objective conditions\nsurrounding an interrogation&quot;).\n\f                                                                   32\n\n\ndefendant responded in the affirmative.     The officers&#x27;\n\nsuspicions &quot;remained unexpressed at this point,&quot; and there was\n\nno evidence that they indicated to the defendant his similarity\n\nto the individual in the video footage.     Medina, 485 Mass. at\n\n302-303 (police did not signal to defendant he was suspected of\n\ncommitting crime even where they explained they received report\n\nthat human remains were in defendant&#x27;s home).     See DePeiza, 449\n\nMass. at 376 (officer &quot;did not imply that the defendant was\n\nsuspected of a crime merely by asking if he was carrying a gun.\n\nCarrying a firearm is not a crime, and the defendant does not\n\nsuggest any other criminal conduct of which he was\n\nsuspected. . . .   Miranda warnings were not required between the\n\nannouncement of the patfrisk and the frisk itself&quot;).\n\n    Even accepting the motion judge&#x27;s finding that the\n\ndefendant was &quot;clearly not free to go at&quot; the time of the pat\n\nfrisk, when he spoke with O&#x27;Brien afterward, O&#x27;Brien explicitly\n\ntold the defendant that he was not under arrest and that he was\n\nfree to go.   These circumstances would not transform the\n\nencounter into a custodial one.     See Groome, 435 Mass. at 213\n\n(defendant&#x27;s fear he might be in custody when in police cruiser\n\nvoluntarily was addressed by officer &quot;when he told the defendant\n\nthat he was not being arrested&quot;).     See also Cawthron, 479 Mass.\n\nat 619 (asking defendant what he had just purchased, when\n\ndetective believed he witnessed drug transaction, did not convey\n\f                                                                       33\n\n\nsuggestion defendants were suspects because it could have\n\nreferred to innocent activities).\n\n    Moreover, the nature of the interrogation points to a\n\nconclusion that the defendant was not in custody when he was\n\nquestioned.    The motion judge found that the &quot;questioning was\n\nnot aggressive in any respect.&quot;     This conclusion was supported\n\nby the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to\n\nsuppress.     The defendant was questioned by two law enforcement\n\nofficers:   O&#x27;Brien and Connolly.   &quot;[N]othing in the record\n\nsuggests that they were &#x27;aggressive,&#x27; &#x27;persistent,&#x27; or &#x27;harsh,&#x27;\n\nwhich would support a conclusion that the defendants had been\n\nsubject to a custodial interrogation.&quot;     Cawthron, 479 Mass. at\n\n621, quoting Coleman, 49 Mass. App. Ct. at 155.     In fact, Price\n\nadmitted on cross-examination at the hearing on the motion to\n\nsuppress that the officers were polite and courteous.     The\n\nquestions asked by the officers were &quot;investigatory rather than\n\naccusatory&quot; where there was no indication that they &quot;raised\n\ntheir voices, threatened the defendant, or expressed disbelief\n\nin response to his answers.&quot;     Medina, 485 Mass. at 303, quoting\n\nKirwan, 448 Mass. at 311.\n\n    Finally, the brief questioning terminated with the\n\ndefendant, Jeune, and Price walking around the area and\n\ncongregating among themselves without police supervision.       They\n\nwent into the fast-food restaurant after the encounter and left\n\f                                                                      34\n\n\nthe location without being arrested by the officers.       Although\n\nfreedom to leave &quot;may be a critical factor . . . [but] cannot be\n\nthe determinative factor,&quot; the fact that the defendant was free\n\nto leave, acknowledged that he was aware of that, and did leave\n\nstrongly supports a conclusion that a reasonable person in the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s position would have felt free to leave.    Medina, 485\n\nMass. at 304, quoting Cawthron, 479 Mass. at 623.\n\n     We conclude, based on the totality of the circumstances,\n\nthat the defendant was not in custody at the time he was\n\nquestioned by the officers because a reasonable person in his\n\nposition would have felt that he was free to leave during the\n\nquestioning.24\n\n     The defendant also asks that the court consider race as a\n\nfactor in considering whether a person such as he would feel\n\nfree to leave a police interaction.   We have held that &quot;the more\n\npertinent question is whether an officer has, through words or\n\nconduct, objectively communicated that the officer would use his\n\nor her police power to coerce that person to stay.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Matta, 483 Mass. 357, 362 (2019).     We\n\nacknowledge &quot;that the troubling past and present of policing and\n\nrace are likely to inform how African-Americans and members of\n\n\n\n\n     24The fact that O&#x27;Brien characterized the motor vehicle\nstop as a &quot;takedown&quot; in his notes does not transform a\nnoncustodial encounter into a custodial one.\n\f                                                                    35\n\n\nother racial minorities interpret police encounters.&quot;     Evelyn,\n\n485 Mass. at 701.   As we determined in Evelyn that other factors\n\nled to a conclusion that the defendant was seized, we did not\n\ndecide &quot;whether the race of a defendant properly informs the\n\nseizure inquiry.&quot;   Id. at 703.   Similarly, here, where the\n\ntotality of the circumstances discussed supra overwhelmingly\n\nsuggest that the defendant was not in custody for purposes of\n\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), consideration of his\n\nrace would not tip the scale with respect to whether the\n\ndefendant was in custody in this particular case.     &quot;We do not\n\ndecide constitutional questions unless they must necessarily be\n\nreached.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Raposo, 453 Mass. 739, 743 (2009),\n\nquoting Commonwealth v. Paasche, 391 Mass. 18, 21 (1984).      Thus,\n\nwe do not answer the question posed here.    Evelyn, supra (&quot;We\n\n. . . attempt to focus attention on the issue of race, while not\n\nestablishing bright-line rules that potentially could do more\n\nharm than good&quot;).\n\n     b.   Dismissal of jurors.    The defendant argues that the\n\njudge&#x27;s dismissal of two jurors for their ability to understand\n\nthe &quot;legal principles&quot; and &quot;complex issues&quot; in the case was\n\nstructural (and prejudicial) error, and the product of racial\n\nbias.   The Commonwealth argues that the judge properly excused\n\nthe jurors because they were unable to sufficiently understand\n\nthe judge&#x27;s instructions on the legal issues.    The Commonwealth\n\f                                                                    36\n\n\nalso argues that there is no evidence of racial bias on behalf\n\nof the judge.     We agree with the Commonwealth that the judge did\n\nnot abuse his discretion in excusing the jurors.\n\n    Juror no. 14 was a twenty-two year old woman who grew up in\n\nHaiti and, when she was in the eighth grade, moved to the United\n\nStates with her adoptive parents, finishing high school in\n\nMiddleton.    During voir dire, counsel for the defendant asked\n\nher about her &quot;feelings or understanding [of] the presumption of\n\ninnocence.&quot;     She responded, &quot;My feeling is, I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s\n\nsad, I would say.     I don&#x27;t know.   Yeah, but.   That&#x27;s all I have,\n\nthat&#x27;s it really sad, but.&quot;     After counsel asked her, &quot;What&#x27;s\n\nsad?&quot;, she responded, &quot;From the basic of the beginning of the\n\npaper, and like when I read it over again, it&#x27;s sad to, like,\n\nread it and listen to it.     But, yeah.&quot;   When counsel pressed\n\njuror no. 14 again on her understanding of the presumption of\n\ninnocence, juror no. 14 answered, &quot;I do not exactly know what it\n\nmeans, so I don&#x27;t think I really have a position here.      It&#x27;s\n\nsad.&quot;\n\n    Counsel then asked her whether she knew what it meant to be\n\ninnocent.     She replied,\n\n    &quot;Innocent is just, like, if the person, if there&#x27;s two\n    people and then one of the commits something and the other\n    one was there but did not really do anything, so I would\n    think he or she was innocent. . . . But I don&#x27;t know if he\n    or she is still going to be affected by just being there.\n    But I would call that person innocent.&quot;\n\f                                                                   37\n\n\nWhen asked what presumption meant, juror no. 14 stated that she\n\ndid not know.   When the judge asked her whether she understood\n\nthe legal information about the case when he read it to the\n\njurors, juror no. 14 responded that she did understand.    The\n\nCommonwealth asked her whether she would be able to look at each\n\ndefendant individually and determine on the evidence whether the\n\ncase was proved against them beyond a reasonable doubt.    Juror\n\nno. 14 responded, &quot;Um, I do not know.   No?&quot;   The Commonwealth\n\nthen broke it down for the juror; she understood the defendants\n\nwere charged in a joint venture, and that she had to decide\n\ntheir guilt or innocence individually based on the evidence.\n\nWhen asked about joint venture, juror no. 14 said, &quot;The words,\n\njoint venture, that someone, like, I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t exactly\n\nunderstand that part.   But I think that&#x27;s the only part that\n\nmaybe, like, bring me down in the question a little.&quot;     After the\n\nCommonwealth read the judge&#x27;s instructions on joint venture to\n\nthe juror again, she said that she thought she would be able to\n\nfollow them.    Jeune&#x27;s attorney then asked leading follow-up\n\nquestions of the juror.    Juror no. 14 indicated that she would\n\nfollow the law the way the judge gave it to her.\n\n    After asking juror no. 14 to step outside, the judge spoke\n\nwith counsel:\n\n    &quot;I have a concern about her understanding of the legal\n    principles, but I&#x27;m going to listen.\n\f                                                                  38\n\n\n    &quot;Her initial response when asked about those aspects did\n    not demonstrate that she really did have an understanding.\n    I think everybody was trying to get her to that point, but\n    I have a concern about her level of understanding.\n\n    &quot;So, I&#x27;m willing to listen.&quot;\n\n    Counsel for the defendant stated that her willingness to\n\nlearn and her interest suggested that with &quot;more time and\n\nexperience,&quot; she would be fully capable of understanding the\n\nrequisite law.   Jeune&#x27;s attorney discussed juror no. 14&#x27;s race\n\nand said, &quot;of all the people that have come here this morning,\n\nthis is the person that is closest demographically to my\n\nclient.&quot;   He noted his concerns about striking jurors &quot;because\n\ntheir vocabulary is not the same as our educated vocabulary.&quot;\n\nThe Commonwealth stated that juror no. 14 was &quot;a remarkable\n\nyoung woman&quot; who had &quot;overcome tremendous obstacles and is\n\nobviously very bright and very engaged.&quot;   Nonetheless, the\n\nCommonwealth was unsure that juror no. 14 understood the\n\npresumption of innocence.   Defense counsel admitted that he &quot;was\n\na little perplexed [himself] when she said that she was sad by\n\nit,&quot; but he thought her confusion was due to a vocabulary issue.\n\n    The judge told counsel:\n\n    &quot;It is important to me to make sure that we have a fair and\n    impartial jury. It is important to me that, if we can,\n    . . . we have some representation on the jury of people\n    that have backgrounds and who look like the defendants. I\n    think that&#x27;s important.\n\n    &quot;But it is important to me that we have jurors who can\n    understand and who demonstrate an ability to do this. This\n\f                                                                   39\n\n\n    is an extremely serious matter, and I have a concern about\n    her ability to understand.\n\n    &quot;And we may not know whether she understands a concept.\n    The concepts that she was asked about, she did not\n    demonstrate a real understanding of.\n\n    &quot;So while I&#x27;m torn, I&#x27;m going to excuse her.&quot;\n\n    At the request of Jeune&#x27;s attorney, the judge allowed a few\n\nmore questions in voir dire.   Juror no. 14 indicated that she\n\ndid her own research into the word &quot;assumption&quot; or\n\n&quot;presumption,&quot; and said that it meant, &quot;you think or something\n\nbut it&#x27;s not certainly true.   Like, you think of something but\n\nyou&#x27;re not exact of whether or not it is true.&quot;   When he asked\n\nher whether she believed that the defendants were innocent\n\nunless the government could prove them guilty, she said, &quot;I\n\ndon&#x27;t want to say the wrong thing.&quot;   After he told her,\n\n&quot;legally, these guys are innocent unless the government can\n\nprove that they&#x27;re guilty,&quot; she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n    The defendant&#x27;s counsel asked juror no. 14 whether she\n\nlooked up &quot;assumption&quot; rather than &quot;presumption,&quot; and she said\n\nshe looked up both.   Jeune&#x27;s attorney asked her whether she\n\nwould like to serve on the jury, and she said, &quot;Um, no.    I don&#x27;t\n\nknow.&quot;   The judge asked her whether she had a concern about her\n\nability to disclose her real answer to the questions, and after\n\nsome back and forth, juror no. 14 indicated that she was\n\nconcerned about whether &quot;to say the right thing or not.    I do\n\f                                                                       40\n\n\nnot want to go down the wrong way with where to answer the right\n\nquestion or not.&quot;     She stated that she was concerned about\n\nmaking the wrong decision in a case such as this.      When Jeune&#x27;s\n\ncounsel asked her whether she could figure out the trial, she\n\nsaid, &quot;If I get -- I don&#x27;t know.      If I learn more about it, I\n\nwill say yes.&quot;     Over the defendant&#x27;s objection, the judge\n\nexcused the juror.     Jeune&#x27;s attorney withdrew his objection.\n\n    Later that day, juror no. 65, another Haitian-American\n\nwoman, indicated on the juror questionnaire that she had a\n\nscheduling problem.     When asked about her problem, she said,\n\n&quot;Scheduling.     Language.&quot;   The judge asked her, as a follow-up,\n\nwhether she had a good reason why she could not serve as a\n\njuror, and she answered in the negative.     Juror no. 65 indicated\n\nthat English was not her first language, and that she had &quot;just\n\n[a] little bit&quot; of difficulty understanding the questions.       The\n\njudge asked her whether she had &quot;some difficulty understanding\n\nthe discussion that we had about some of the law that applies\n\nhere?&quot;   She replied, &quot;Little bit.&quot;    The judge asked her whether\n\nher difficulty with the language would make it difficult for her\n\nto be a juror.     She first replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; then she\n\nreplied, &quot;No.&quot;     Juror no. 65, on her own, offered, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna\n\ntry,&quot; but then acknowledged that the language would make it\n\ndifficult for her.\n\f                                                                      41\n\n\n    When the judge asked about her acknowledgment on the\n\nquestionnaire that there is something that would make it\n\ndifficult for her to participate in the trial, juror no. 65\n\nsaid, &quot;Because I&#x27;m gonna ask you to repeat for me if I not\n\nunderstand very well this question.&quot;       When the judge explained\n\nthe question further, juror no. 65 said, &quot;Well, I misunderstood.\n\nI don&#x27;t have any problems.    Sorry.&quot;    Although she checked off on\n\nthe questionnaire that she knew someone from the district\n\nattorney&#x27;s office for Middlesex County or the defense attorneys&#x27;\n\noffices, she told the judge, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t know anyone.&quot;        Over\n\nobjections from both Jeune and defense counsel, the judge\n\nexcused juror no. 65.     Jeune&#x27;s attorney opined that juror no. 65\n\nwas not given a fair opportunity.       The judge explained that he\n\nexcused her because she mistakenly answered &quot;yes&quot; to all the\n\nquestions stated above.    The judge stated:     &quot;[In] those\n\ncircumstances, I feel that she was not a person who would have\n\nunderstood the complex issues in this particular case.&quot;\n\n    We review the judge&#x27;s dismissal of the jurors for an abuse\n\nof discretion.   Commonwealth v. Grier, 490 Mass. 455, 467\n\n(2022).   We will only find an abuse of discretion &quot;where &#x27;the\n\njudge made a clear error of judgment in weighing the factors\n\nrelevant to the decision . . . such that the decision falls\n\noutside the range of reasonable alternatives.&#x27;&quot;       Id. at 467-468,\n\nquoting Commonwealth v.

Perez, 460 Mass. 683, 688 (2011), quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Vann Long, 419 Mass. 798, 803 (1995).\n\n    It is a trial judge&#x27;s duty to ensure that a &quot;prospective\n\njuror will be able to fairly evaluate the evidence and apply the\n\njudge&#x27;s instructions on the law.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Williams, 481\n\nMass. 443, 453 (2019).   Voir dire of jurors, in a criminal case,\n\n&quot;shall include questions designed to learn whether such juror\n\nunderstands that a defendant is presumed innocent until proven\n\nguilty, that the [C]ommonwealth has the burden of proving guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, and that the defendant need not\n\npresent evidence on the defendant&#x27;s behalf.&quot;     G. L. c. 234A,\n\n\u00a7 67A.   &quot;If the court finds that such juror does not so\n\nunderstand, another juror shall be called in.&quot;      Id.\n\n    The judge&#x27;s questions and the attorneys&#x27; inquiry of both\n\njurors were designed to ensure understanding of these crucial\n\nconcepts.   As to juror no. 14, despite her clear\n\nmisunderstanding of the quintessential legal principle of\n\n&quot;presumption of innocence,&quot; the judge allowed the attorneys to\n\nquestion her extensively, presumably with the hope that she\n\nwould gain an understanding.   The judge explicitly indicated\n\nthat he was sensitive to her similarity in race to the\n\f                                                                    43\n\n\ndefendants, but his concern that she could not understand the\n\nimportant legal concepts at play resulted in her exclusion.\n\n    Although the attorneys were not permitted to examine juror\n\nno. 65 as they were juror no. 14, it was clear based on the voir\n\ndire that juror no. 65 had comprehension problems that likely\n\nwould affect her ability to serve as a juror in this complicated\n\ntrial.     Juror no. 65 herself acknowledged that the language\n\nbarrier would make it difficult for her to serve on the jury.\n\nWhen a &quot;person is not able to speak and understand the English\n\nlanguage,&quot; there are grounds for disqualification from jury\n\nservice.    G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 4.\n\n    It is true that, in certain circumstances, &quot;[a] &#x27;lack of\n\nworking knowledge of the vocabulary of criminal law . . . simply\n\ndoes not qualify as a valid, race-neutral basis on which to\n\nexercise a peremptory challenge.&quot;     Commonwealth v. Rosa-Roman,\n\n485 Mass. 617, 637 (2020), quoting Commonwealth v. Benoit, 452\n\nMass. 212, 224 (2008) (improper to exercise peremptory challenge\n\nin response to juror&#x27;s confusion about word &quot;interest&quot; in\n\ncontext of having &quot;stake in the case&quot;).     See Benoit, supra\n\n(&quot;juror&#x27;s slip of the tongue&quot; in her use of term &quot;prosecute&quot;\n\nrather than &quot;convict&quot; did not qualify as race-neutral basis to\n\nexercise peremptory challenge).     Nonetheless, lack of\n\ncomprehension is a &quot;legitimate reason[] to doubt [a] juror&#x27;s\n\nsuitability to serve.&quot;     Grier, 490 Mass. at 468.\n\f                                                                    44\n\n\n    In Grier, 490 Mass. at 467, a juror who had been seated was\n\ndiscovered, following a criminal record check, to have failed to\n\ndisclose several prior arrests and charges when filling out the\n\nquestionnaire.    After an additional voir dire with the juror on\n\nthe next day of jury selection, the judge excused him for cause,\n\nciting &quot;concerns about comprehension and about candor.&quot;       Id.\n\nDefense counsel objected, as this was the only Black male on the\n\njury.   Id.   We held that it was a fair inference that the\n\nfailures to disclose could be explained by either a lack of\n\ncandor or comprehension, which supported the judge&#x27;s decision to\n\nexcuse him.   Id. at 468.   This conclusion was bolstered by the\n\njuror&#x27;s nonresponsive answers to the judge&#x27;s questions during\n\nthe additional voir dire.    Id.\n\n    Similarly, here, both juror nos. 14 and 65 gave answers\n\nthat illustrated their lack of comprehension, despite both of\n\ntheir seemingly genuine efforts to understand.    This did not\n\nappear to be connected to any heightened standard imposed by the\n\njudge as to a juror&#x27;s intelligence, education, or robust\n\nknowledge of legal vocabulary, but rather appeared to be\n\nconnected to the jurors&#x27; minimal understanding of the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s right to be presumed innocent and their ability to\n\nfollow instructions as given to them by the judge.    Contrast\n\nCommonwealth v. Robertson, 480 Mass. 383, 396 n.11 (2018)\n\n(Commonwealth&#x27;s reason for challenge that &quot;juror did not seem\n\f                                                                    45\n\n\nintelligent&quot; was &quot;insufficient in these circumstances&quot; to\n\novercome other considerations in first step of Batson-Soares\n\nanalysis).    In such circumstances, we cannot say that the judge\n\nabused his discretion in dismissing them.\n\n     Nor can we conclude that the judge&#x27;s dismissal of the\n\njurors was a product of implicit bias, where he had legitimate,\n\ncomprehension-based reasons to excuse them.25   To the contrary,\n\nat least as to juror no. 14, the judge explicitly acknowledged\n\nher race in making the difficult determination to excuse her.\n\nThe judge did not improperly &quot;scrub[] [the jury] . . . of a\n\ngroup of jurors, representative of a substantial segment of\n\nsociety, who might have been particularly sensitive to the\n\nracial dynamics at play in the case,&quot; and did not treat juror\n\nnos. 14 and 65 differently from non-Black jurors, as alleged by\n\nthe defendant.    Commonwealth v. Alves, 96 Mass. App. Ct. 540,\n\n548 (2019).   The judge excused several non-Black jurors,\n\nincluding Hispanic and white individuals, who expressed a\n\nfailure to comprehend core foundational principles or difficulty\n\n\n\n\n     25See Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 485 Mass. 491, 516 n.1\n(2020) (Lowy, J., concurring), quoting Commonwealth v. Buckley,\n478 Mass. 861, 878 n.4 (2018) (&quot;Multiple studies confirm the\nexistence of implicit bias, and that implicit bias predicts\nreal-world behavior. . . . That is, even people who do not\nbelieve themselves to harbor implicit bias may in fact act in\nways that disfavor people of color&quot;).\n\f                                                                  46\n\n\nwith English during voir dire.26   And just as the judge gave\n\njuror nos. 6 and 39, for example, an opportunity to explain and\n\nclarify their answers (partly, as it related to juror no. 6, in\n\nresponse to defense counsel&#x27;s confusingly worded questions), he\n\nalso gave juror no. 14 numerous opportunities to clarify her\n\nanswers, as discussed in detail supra.    As to juror no. 65, the\n\ntranscript and her answers in the questionnaire convey that she\n\nhad a problem understanding the judge&#x27;s basic questions, without\n\neven getting into the legal principles in the case.    See\n\nWilliams, 481 Mass. at 457 (&quot;It is the exclusion of prospective\n\njurors &#x27;solely by virtue of their membership in, or affiliation\n\nwith, particular, defined groupings in the community&#x27; that\n\nviolates a defendant&#x27;s constitutional right to a fair and\n\nimpartial jury, not excusing prospective jurors for cause\n\nbecause the judge believes, after voir dire, that they cannot be\n\nimpartial&quot; [citation omitted]).    There was no error here.\n\n     c.   O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s identification of the defendant.   The\n\ndefendant argues that the admission of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s identification\n\nof the defendant as the man depicted in the surveillance video\n\nrecording was improper, and that the error was compounded by the\n\n\n\n\n     26The selected jury were comprised of nine white jurors,\none Asian juror, two Brazilian-Hispanic jurors, one Black juror,\none juror who did not reveal race, and two for whom the office\nof jury commissioner lacked data on their race, but whom counsel\nnoted to be white.\n\f                                                                     47\n\n\nprosecutor&#x27;s reference to the &quot;distinctive braids&quot; of the person\n\nin the video recording and the judge&#x27;s identification\n\ninstruction.   The Commonwealth argues that the judge properly\n\nallowed O&#x27;Brien to identify the defendant in the surveillance\n\nfootage, that the prosecutor never mentioned the identification\n\nin closing argument and appropriately responded to defense\n\ncounsel&#x27;s closing argument by mentioning the braids, and that\n\nthe judge&#x27;s instruction was proper.\n\n    Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to\n\nexclude lay opinion testimony regarding the identity of persons\n\nin surveillance video recordings.     This motion was denied as to\n\nO&#x27;Brien&#x27;s identification of the persons in the recordings.     The\n\njudge wrote:\n\n    &quot;I have reviewed the videos in question and find they are\n    generally of good quality, but neither unmistakably clear\n    nor hopelessly obscure. The appearances of the defendants\n    as they will be seen in court are different than the\n    appearances of the persons in the videos, where hats and\n    hooded sweatshirts obscure some of the features. One of\n    the defendants is wearing glasses in court and it is not\n    clear that the persons in the video are wearing glasses.\n    Finally, the Trooper&#x27;s familiarity with the defendants\n    based on his investigation of this matter is a factor\n    weighing in favor of the admissibility of such an\n    identification.&quot;\n\n    As mentioned supra, over objection, O&#x27;Brien identified the\n\ndefendant in the surveillance video recording several times\n\nthroughout the trial.   Because the defendant objected to\n\nO&#x27;Brien&#x27;s identification of the defendant at trial, we review\n\f                                                                    48\n\n\nhis identification testimony for prejudicial error.     Grier, 490\n\nMass. at 475-476.\n\n    As an expression of opinion, identifying a person from a\n\nvideo image &quot;is admissible only where &#x27;the subject matter to\n\nwhich the testimony relates cannot be reproduced or described to\n\nthe jury precisely as it appeared to the witness at the time.&#x27;&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Wardsworth, 482 Mass. 454, 475 (2019), quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Austin, 421 Mass. 357, 366 (1995).    The purpose\n\nof such lay witness testimony is to &quot;assist the jurors in making\n\ntheir own independent identification.&quot;    Wardsworth, supra,\n\nquoting Commonwealth v. Pina, 481 Mass. 413, 429 (2019).     &quot;The\n\ngeneral rule is that a witness&#x27;s opinion concerning the identity\n\nof a person depicted in a surveillance photograph is admissible\n\nif there is some basis for concluding that the witness is more\n\nlikely to correctly identify the defendant from the photograph\n\nthan is the jury.&quot;   Pina, supra at 429-430, quoting Commonwealth\n\nv. Vacher, 469 Mass. 425, 441 (2014).    In other words, these\n\nidentifications are admissible &quot;when the witness possesses\n\nsufficiently relevant familiarity with the defendant that the\n\njury cannot also possess.&quot;   Wardsworth, supra, quoting Vacher,\n\nsupra.   &quot;If the witness lacks such familiarity, it is the\n\nprovince of the jury to draw their own conclusions regarding the\n\nidentity of the person depicted without the witness&#x27;s\n\nassistance.&quot;   Wardsworth, supra, quoting Vacher, supra.\n\f                                                                 49\n\n\n     Here, as in Wardsworth, &quot;the jury were able to view the\n\nsame surveillance footage that [O&#x27;Brien] watched.&quot;   Wardsworth,\n\n482 Mass. at 475.   Although they were not able to see\n\nphotographs taken of the defendant the night of the murder, or\n\nthe sweatshirt and hat that he presumably was wearing at the\n\ntime of the crimes,27 the jury were provided photographs from the\n\nstop at the drive-through that occurred a little over a day\n\nafter the crimes and the defendant&#x27;s booking photographs taken\n\nthree days after the crimes.   The only indications that the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s appearance changed between the time the video\n\nrecording was made and the time of trial were statements from\n\nhis counsel and the judge&#x27;s decision on the motion in limine\n\nthat he was wearing glasses at the time of trial.    The defendant\n\nwas not wearing glasses in the photographs taken close in time\n\nto the crimes that were provided to the jury.   Although we\n\nrecognize that O&#x27;Brien watched the video recordings numerous\n\ntimes during his investigation of this matter, and that he\n\ninteracted with the defendant at the drive-through, he did not\n\npossess &quot;sufficiently relevant familiarity with the defendant\n\nthat the jury [could not] also possess.&quot;   Wardsworth, supra,\n\n\n\n\n     27The Commonwealth introduced pants recovered from the\ndefendant&#x27;s home, which the prosecutor argued he wore during the\ncrime.\n\f                                                                   50\n\n\nquoting Vacher, 469 Mass. at 441.28   &quot;The jury were capable of\n\nviewing the videotape and drawing their own conclusions\n\nregarding whether the man in the videotape was the defendant\n\nwithout the assistance of [O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s] testimony.&quot;    Austin, 421\n\nMass. at 366.    Therefore, the admission of his lay testimony\n\nidentifying the defendant in the video recording was error.\n\n     This error, however, does not require reversal.       We\n\nrecognize that there is &quot;increase[d] potential for inappropriate\n\nprejudice to the defendant stemming from identification\n\ntestimony from a police officer who is so designated&quot; (citation\n\nomitted).   Wardsworth, 482 Mass. at 476.   Nonetheless, we also\n\nhave determined that no prejudice existed in specific\n\ncircumstances where the evidence against the defendant was\n\nstrong, where the identification was fleeting, or where the\n\ndefendant admitted to being present at the scene.    Id.    See\n\nAustin, 421 Mass. at 366.\n\n     In this case, the defendant did not admit to being at the\n\nscene.    Despite this, where there was no indication that the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s appearance at trial markedly differed from his\n\n\n\n\n     28Here, O&#x27;Brien gained familiarity with the defendant\nthrough his repeated review of the video recording and one brief\ninteraction with the defendant. We limit our holding to these\nfacts and express no opinion on whether a police officer could\nidentify a defendant on a video recording or in a photograph if,\nfor example, he specifically had surveilled a defendant over a\nlonger period of time.\n\f                                                                   51\n\n\nappearance in the video recording and in photographs taken after\n\nthe crime, the jury were &quot;capable of drawing the same\n\nconclusion&quot; as O&#x27;Brien.29   Vacher, 469 Mass. at 442.   Contrary to\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s assertion, the jury saw the Burlington hotel\n\nvideo recording before O&#x27;Brien identified the defendant as one\n\nof the people in the recording.30   Based on the photographs and\n\nthe recording admitted, the jury could have found that the\n\ndefendant resembled the individual on the recording.    Although\n\nO&#x27;Brien mentioned his identification of the defendant in the\n\nrecording approximately four or five times throughout his\n\nextensive testimony, no other witness was permitted to identify\n\nthe defendant in the recordings.    Contrast Wardsworth, 482 Mass.\n\nat 474 (four officers identified defendant in video footage, one\n\npointing out similarity to defendant&#x27;s clothing before jury saw\n\nvideo recording).\n\n     Further, although no other witness identified the defendant\n\nat the scene of the crime, the evidence against the defendant\n\nwas strong.   Aside from the similarity to the man in the video\n\nfootage, on the day following the shooting, the defendant was in\n\n\n     29The video footage admitted was &quot;neither &#x27;. . .\nunmistakably clear or . . . hopelessly obscure.&#x27;&quot; Commonwealth\nv. Pleas, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 321, 325 (2000), quoting United\nStates v. Jackman, 48 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n     30The fact that O&#x27;Brien told the jury he watched the Saugus\nhotel video footage &quot;dozens and dozens of times&quot; does not alter\nour conclusion here, for the reasons stated infra.\n\f                                                                    52\n\n\nthe distinct car shown in the video recording.    The defendant\n\nlied to the officers about his whereabouts at the time of the\n\ncrimes.   At 12:30 P.M. on July 2, 2015, after several messages\n\nwere found on Jeune&#x27;s cell phone regarding the murder, Jeune\n\nsent a text message to the defendant, &quot;Ima kall u in a min.       Its\n\non da news.&quot;31   There were repeated telephone calls between Jeune\n\nand the defendant in the days before, on the day of, and in the\n\ndays following the murder.   The defendant was acutely aware of\n\nJeune&#x27;s new cell phone number after the murder:    on June 12, he\n\ngave an individual the 9575 number when asked for Jeune&#x27;s cell\n\nphone number; on July 3, the day after the murder, he gave that\n\nsame individual the 9096 number.   There was no outgoing activity\n\non the defendant&#x27;s cell phone on July 2 from 12:09 to 12:35\n\nA.M.; the murder happened at approximately 12:20 A.M.    The CSLI\n\nplaced both the defendant&#x27;s cell phone and the cell phone with\n\nthe 9575 number in Boston before and after the murder.    This\n\nevidence, connected with the abundance of evidence against\n\nJeune, his joint venturer, supports our conclusion.    See Vacher,\n\n469 Mass. at 442 (&quot;The testimony, brief and fleeting as it was,\n\ndid not overwhelm the other compelling, properly admitted\n\nevidence against the defendant&quot;); Austin, 421 Mass. at 366\n\n(admission of identification testimony not reversible error\n\n\n     31A minute later, Jeune sent a text message to &quot;Mama Bear&quot;\nthat &quot;[t]hey didn&#x27;t even search the room yet.&quot;\n\f                                                                 53\n\n\nwhere, in part, evidence pointing to defendant was\n\n&quot;overwhelming&quot;).\n\n    Additionally, and most impactful to our determination that\n\nthe admission of the testimony was not prejudicial, the judge\n\ngave several forceful instructions regarding O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s\n\nidentification of the defendant on the video recording.    During\n\nO&#x27;Brien&#x27;s testimony, the judge instructed the jury:\n\n    &quot;You&#x27;ve heard some opinion evidence or testimony from this\n    witness who has identified various people in the videos\n    that you&#x27;ve seen from several hotels. That evidence, the\n    opinion evidence was offered for whatever assistance it may\n    provide to you in your own determinations in this case.\n    You are not bound to accept that testimony and, indeed, you\n    must make your own determinations as to what you see in\n    those security videos. That is your determination and your\n    determination alone. You may consider the testimony of\n    Trooper O&#x27;Brien regarding the identity of those persons in\n    the video, along with all of the other evidence, and you\n    may give it whatever weight, if any, that you deem it is\n    fairly entitled to receive, but you must remember that you\n    must decide for yourselves what those security videos show\n    you.&quot; (Emphases added.)\n\n    Again, as a part of his instructions to the jury at the\n\nclose of evidence, the judge also gave an identification\n\ninstruction, reminding the jury that an identification must be\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.   He specifically mentioned\n\nO&#x27;Brien in this instruction:\n\n    &quot;As with any witness, you must determine the credibility of\n    a witness identifying a defendant as a participant in the\n    crimes charged. In this case, Trooper Sean O&#x27;Brien\n    provided some identification evidence. If you conclude\n    that he was not telling the truth regarding the\n    identification of the persons in the security videos, you\n    must disregard that testimony. If you conclude that he\n\f                                                                   54\n\n\n    intended to tell the truth, you must also consider the\n    possibility that the witness made a good faith error in\n    identification. That is, you should consider whether the\n    witness could be honestly mistaken in his identification of\n    the defendants&quot; (emphasis added).\n\nThe judge then went on to discuss why people make mistakes in\n\nidentification, listing factors that the jury should consider\n\nwhen determining whether the identification made by O&#x27;Brien was\n\naccurate.    He also instructed the jury, &quot;You may consider that\n\nthe witness and the persons he identified are of different\n\nraces.    Research has shown that people of all races may have\n\ngreater difficulty in accurately identifying members of a\n\ndifferent race than they do in identifying members of their own\n\nrace.&quot;    See Commonwealth v. Bastaldo, 472 Mass. 16, 18 (2015)\n\n(&quot;cross-racial instruction should always be included when giving\n\nthe model eyewitness identification instruction, unless the\n\nparties agree that there was no cross-racial identification&quot;);\n\nCommonwealth v. Gomes, 470 Mass. 352, 382 (2015) (Appendix),\n\nS.C., 478 Mass. 1025 (2018) (appropriate to add jury instruction\n\nof this nature where witness and offender are of different\n\nraces).   He finished the identification instruction with more\n\ncomments specific to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s identification:\n\n    &quot;In the end, you must determin[e] for yourselves what the\n    security videos show you. You may give the identification\n    testimony of Trooper O&#x27;Brien whatever weight you deem it is\n    fairly entitled to receive. If you are not convinced\n    beyond a reasonable doubt that a person was a person who\n    committed or who participated in the commission of the\n    crimes charged, that defendant must be found not guilty.\n\f                                                                  55\n\n\n\n    &quot;Now, you heard testimony from Trooper O&#x27;Brien who\n    identified persons that in his opinion were seen in\n    security videos from several hotels. That evidence was\n    offered for whatever assistance, if any, that it provided\n    to you in your determinations in this case. You are not\n    bound in any way to accept that testimony, and you must\n    make your own determinations as to what you see in those\n    security videos. That is your determination and your\n    determination alone.\n\n    &quot;You may consider the testimony of Trooper O&#x27;Brien\n    regarding the persons in the security videos, along with\n    all of the other evidence, and you may give it whatever\n    weight, if any, that you deem it is fairly entitled to\n    receive. But you must remember that you must decide for\n    yourselves what those security videos show you.&quot; (Emphases\n    added.)\n\n    Assuming that the defendant preserved his objection to\n\nthese identification instructions, they closely followed the\n\nModel Jury Instructions on Eyewitness Identification, 473 Mass.\n\n1051 (2015).   Although O&#x27;Brien was not an &quot;eyewitness&quot; present\n\nat the scene of the crime, these instructions were appropriate\n\nwhere he was a lay witness identifying the defendant as someone\n\nhe saw at the scene of the crime (albeit in a video recording of\n\nthat scene).   Cf. Commonwealth v. Snyder, 475 Mass. 445, 455\n\nn.24 (2016), citing Commonwealth v. Collins, 470 Mass. 255, 265\n\nn.15 (2014), (distinction between identification by eyewitness\n\nat scene of crime and identification by eyewitness who observed\n\ndefendant before or after crime); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 470\n\nMass. 389, 396 (2015) (&quot;Because, here, there was no\n\nidentification testimony that significantly incriminated the\n\f                                                                   56\n\n\ndefendant, the judge did not abuse his discretion in declining\n\nto give the modified identification instruction&quot;); Commonwealth\n\nv. Williams, 58 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 143 (2003) (where eyewitness\n\npolice officers identified defendant, &quot;the jury should have been\n\ngiven the choice to conclude that the police officers had not\n\nlied, but were honestly mistaken in their identifications of the\n\ndefendant&quot;).    The insistence of the judge, through these\n\ninstructions, that the jury must determine the identity of the\n\nmen in the video footage on their own commands our conclusion\n\nthat the error in admitting this testimony did not prejudice the\n\ndefendant.     See Commonwealth v. Andrade, 468 Mass. 543, 549\n\n(2014) (&quot;The jury are presumed to follow the judge&#x27;s\n\ninstructions&quot;).\n\n    The prosecutor&#x27;s repeated reference to the defendant&#x27;s\n\n&quot;distinctive braids&quot; in closing argument does not alter our\n\nconclusion.    Where the defendant did not object to this aspect\n\nof the prosecutor&#x27;s closing, we review for a substantial\n\nlikelihood of a miscarriage of justice.     Commonwealth v. Moffat,\n\n486 Mass. 193, 201 (2020).     At the outset, it bears mention that\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s counsel referenced the braids of the individual\n\nin the video recording, although seemingly to suggest that they\n\nmean nothing in the context of the perpetrator being the\n\ndefendant.     See Commonwealth v. Fernandes, 478 Mass. 725, 741\n\n(2018) (prosecutor entitled to point out weaknesses of\n\f                                                                 57\n\n\ndefendant&#x27;s case and reply to defendant&#x27;s closing argument).     In\n\nCommonwealth v. Davis, 487 Mass. 448, 469 (2021), S.C., 491\n\nMass. 1011 (2023), we recognized that &quot;braided hairstyles are\n\nnot uncommon among Black people,&quot; and pointed out that even if\n\nthere were evidence that the length of the defendant&#x27;s hair were\n\nsimilar to that of the perpetrator in the video recording, it\n\nwould have fallen short, in that particular case, of evidence\n\nfrom which the jury could have identified the defendant as the\n\nperpetrator in the recording.   Id. at 469 n.26.   As a result, we\n\nheld that it was improper for the Commonwealth to suggest that\n\nthe jury could identify the defendant based on the recording.\n\nId. at 469.\n\n     Here, although the video recordings from the various hotels\n\nwere not clear, they were not altogether &quot;[low] enough\n\nresolution [or] taken from too far away to be [un]able to\n\ndiscern any features of the [defendant&#x27;s] face,&quot; unlike the\n\nvideo recording in Davis, 487 Mass. at 469.   On at least two of\n\nthe recordings, a conscientious observer can see that the\n\nindividual alleged to be the defendant has a small amount of\n\nfacial hair, and the individual&#x27;s face is visible for a short\n\nperiod of time, particularly in the Saugus video recording.32    In\n\neach of the recordings, the individual&#x27;s chin-length, single\n\n\n     32In the booking photographs of the defendant, he has a\nsmall amount of facial hair on his chin and a mustache.\n\f                                                                 58\n\n\nbraids are visible.   This comported with the testimony of the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s former girlfriend, who said that at the time, she\n\nbraided the defendant&#x27;s single, &quot;unattached,&quot; chin-length\n\nbraids, and the booking photographs of the defendant, which\n\nclearly depict the same style of braids.   Further, the\n\nprosecutor did not only focus on the braids of the person in the\n\nvideo recordings but also pointed out the individual&#x27;s build and\n\nthe &quot;tapered&quot; cargo pants similar to those recovered by police\n\nfrom the defendant&#x27;s home.   Because the video recordings were of\n\nsufficient quality to discern other features of the individual\n\ndepicted, the prosecutor did not err in her repeated references\n\nto the similarity of the braids to those of the defendant.\n\n     Finally, in closing argument, the prosecutor never relied\n\non O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s identification of the defendant in the surveillance\n\nvideo recordings.33   Rather, the prosecutor implored the jury to\n\n\n     33The closest the prosecutor came to discussing the\nidentification testimony was:\n\n     &quot;You see [the defendant&#x27;s] build and, yes, you see the\n     tapered pant leg of the cargo pants described by . . .\n     O&#x27;Brien as what he observed in that videotape. . . .\n\n     &quot;. . .\n\n     &quot;In this case, you also have the benefit of very good video\n     showing [the defendant] walking through at Saugus, as well\n     as at Woburn, as well as the [hotel] in Burlington, that\n     all show his stride in his walk. And I&#x27;d ask you to look\n     carefully at that because it bears out the description\n     given by . . . O&#x27;Brien, as well as the type of pants that\n     police recovered from his home.&quot;\n\f                                                                 59\n\n\ncompare the photographs in evidence of the defendant with the\n\nindividual seen in the video recordings to make their own\n\nidentification, paying attention to the defendant&#x27;s &quot;unique\n\nappearance.&quot;   This, as well, contributes to our determination\n\nthat the defendant was not prejudiced by the improper testimony.\n\n     d.   Sufficiency of evidence for felony-murder.   The\n\ndefendant argues that the evidence supporting his conviction of\n\nmurder in the first degree was insufficient in the wake of\n\nCommonwealth v. Brown, 477 Mass. 805 (2017), cert. denied, 139\n\nS. Ct. 54 (2018).34   In our review of the denial of a motion for\n\na required finding of not guilty, &quot;we consider the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial in the light most favorable to the\n\nCommonwealth, and determine whether a rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.&quot;    Oberle, 476 Mass. at 547.\n\n     In Brown, a majority of the court held that:\n\n     &quot;a defendant who commits an armed robbery as a joint\n     venturer will be found guilty of murder where a killing was\n     committed in the course of that robbery if he or she\n     knowingly participated in the killing with the intent\n     required to commit it -- that is, with the intent either to\n     kill, to cause grievous bodily harm, or to do an act which,\n     in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonable\n     person would have known created a plain and strong\n     likelihood that death would result&quot; (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n     34The defendant&#x27;s trial commenced after this court&#x27;s\nholding in Brown, 477 Mass. 805.\n\f                                                                   60\n\n\nBrown, 477 Mass. at 832 (Gants, C.J., concurring).   In doing so,\n\nthe court limited the scope of felony-murder &quot;to its statutory\n\nrole under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, as an aggravating element of\n\nmurder&quot; where the killing occurs &quot;in the course of a felony\n\npunishable by life imprisonment.&quot;   Id. at 807.   This &quot;eliminated\n\nthe theory of proof of criminal intent by constructive malice.&quot;\n\nCommonwealth v. Dawson, 490 Mass. 521, 531 (2022).\n\n     Where, as in Brown, the predicate felony was attempted\n\narmed robbery, &quot;the Commonwealth also was required to prove that\n\nthe defendant knew that one of his accomplices possessed a\n\nfirearm.&quot;   Brown, 477 Mass. at 812.   &quot;Knowing participation in a\n\ncriminal offense &#x27;may take any of several forms,&#x27; and includes\n\nproviding &#x27;aid or assistance in committing the crime.&#x27;&quot;    Id. at\n\n812-813, quoting Commonwealth v. Zanetti, 454 Mass. 449, 470\n\n(2009) (Appendix).\n\n     Attempted armed robbery is a proper underlying felony to\n\nsupport a conviction of murder in the first degree based on a\n\ntheory of felony-murder.   Commonwealth v. Quiles, 488 Mass. 298,\n\n306 (2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 1237 (2022).    &quot;An attempt\n\nis defined as (1) an intent to commit the underlying crime and\n\n(2) an overt act towards its commission.&quot;   Id. at 308, quoting\n\nBrown, 477 Mass. at 812 n.5.35\n\n\n     35To support an armed robbery conviction as part of a joint\nventure, the Commonwealth must prove &quot;that the defendant was\n\f                                                                  61\n\n\n     The evidence formed a foundation for the jury to conclude\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, knowing Jeune was\n\narmed with a firearm, went to the Burlington hotel with the\n\nintent to rob Johnson at gunpoint.36   After the defendant\n\nparticipated in the robbery of Emily, during which he knocked on\n\nher door to gain entry and took her money and belongings while\n\nJeune held a gun to her head, at least at that point, he would\n\nhave been aware that Jeune had a firearm and was prepared to use\n\nit to carry out the robbery of Johnson.   Indeed, the jury&#x27;s\n\nverdict acknowledged as much where the jury convicted the\n\ndefendant of murder in the first degree of Johnson, but\n\nacquitted him on unlawful possession of a firearm, home\n\ninvasion, and armed assault in a dwelling, and convicted him of\n\nthe lesser included offense of unarmed robbery of Emily.     &quot;Even\n\nif the defendant had been unaware that [Jeune] possessed a\n\nweapon in advance, it would be reasonable to conclude that he\n\nbecame aware over the course of the&quot; robbery of Emily, &quot;and\n\ncontinued to participate&quot; in the attempted robbery of Johnson,\n\n\n\n\npart of a venture in which at least one of the coventurers was\narmed with a dangerous weapon, either applied violence to the\nvictim[&#x27;s] bod[y] or put [her] in fear, and took the victim[&#x27;s]\nproperty with the intent to steal it.&quot; Commonwealth v. Rakes,\n478 Mass. 22, 33 (2017).\n\n     36In so holding, we rely on our conclusion that the\nevidence was sufficient for the jury to identify the defendant\nas the man with the braids.\n\f                                                                   62\n\n\n&quot;implicating him in the joint venture.&quot;   Commonwealth v. Rakes,\n\n478 Mass. 22, 33 (2017).   See Commonwealth v. Eagles, 491 Mass.\n\n210, 219 (2023) (defendant&#x27;s continued participation in robbery\n\nafter learning of coventurer&#x27;s use of weapon, combined with his\n\nfailure to render aid to victim, telephone 911, or disassociate\n\nhimself from coventurer, demonstrated necessary intent for armed\n\nrobbery); Commonwealth v. Phap Buth, 480 Mass. 113, 117, cert.\n\ndenied, 139 S. Ct. 607 (2018) (&quot;Where a defendant continues to\n\nact in furtherance of the joint venture even after learning of a\n\ncoventurer&#x27;s weapon, we have allowed an inference that the\n\ncoventurer had the requisite intent for the joint venture&quot;).\n\n     We reject the defendant&#x27;s contention that the jury could\n\nnot have found that he carried out &quot;an act which, in the\n\ncircumstances known to the defendant, a reasonable person would\n\nhave known created a plain and strong likelihood that death\n\nwould result&quot; because there was no evidence that he knew Jeune&#x27;s\n\ngun was loaded or functional, or that he believed Jeune would\n\nfire the gun.37   Brown, 477 Mass. at 832 (Gants, C.J.,\n\nconcurring).   &quot;Absent proof that the defendant himself was\n\narmed, proof that he knew his coventurer to be armed suffices to\n\nsatisfy the standard&quot; for attempted armed robbery.   Rakes, 478\n\nMass. at 33.   &quot;Where an unarmed felon knows that his accomplice\n\n\n     37&quot;The Commonwealth was not required to prove who shot the\nvictim.&quot; Commonwealth v. Housen, 458 Mass. 702, 708 (2011).\n\f                                                                    63\n\n\nin a robbery is carrying a gun, even if he believes the gun is\n\nunloaded and his accomplice has no ammunition, that robbery is\n\ninherently dangerous to human life.&quot;    Commonwealth v. Carter,\n\n396 Mass. 234, 237 (1985).    Even if a gun were unloaded, its use\n\n&quot;may provoke violent resistance from the intended victim or may\n\nspur others, such as police officers, to intervene with deadly\n\nforce.&quot;    Id.\n\n    During the robbery of Emily, while the defendant was in the\n\nroom with Emily and Jeune and standing to the left of Jeune,\n\nJeune said to Emily, &quot;If you scream, believe me, I can scream\n\nlouder.&quot;    From this, the jury could infer that the defendant was\n\naware that Jeune was willing to discharge the weapon if\n\nnecessary to ensure the compliance of their victims.\n\nNotwithstanding this awareness, the defendant continued to\n\nparticipate in the robbery of Emily, and then the attempted\n\nrobbery of Johnson.    That Jeune did not fire the gun during the\n\nincident involving Sarah (where they were not able to enter her\n\nroom) or the robbery of Emily (where Emily complied with their\n\ndemands) does not convince us otherwise.    Although we\n\nacknowledge, after Brown, 477 Mass. at 835 (Gants, C.J.,\n\nconcurring), that not every killing committed in the course of a\n\nlife felony would constitute felony-murder, the defendant&#x27;s\n\nparticipation in this case does, because in attempting to rob\n\nJohnson after the robbery of Emily, he committed &quot;an act which,\n\f                                                                   64\n\n\nin the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonable person\n\nwould have known created a plain and strong likelihood that\n\ndeath would result.&quot;   Id. at 832 (Gants, C.J., concurring).\n\n     That the defendant and Jeune did not take Johnson&#x27;s money\n\nafter the shooting also does not alter our conclusion, where it\n\nis the defendant&#x27;s intent before the shooting, not after, that\n\nis relevant, and where their failure to take the money may have\n\nbeen attributable to their desire to distance themselves from\n\nthe scene of the crime as expeditiously as possible.    That\n\nJohnson did not act as submissively as they might have hoped\n\ndoes not alter their intent on entry to her room.    We disagree\n\nwith the defendant that the evidence &quot;suggests Jeune did not\n\nintend to shoot Johnson.&quot;   The loud bang was heard by guests of\n\nthe Burlington hotel after they heard a woman yelling for help,\n\nand Johnson was discovered with the telephone cord stretched out\n\nunder her body with blood smears by the telephone, suggesting\n\nthat Johnson was killed to keep her quiet.\n\n     We also reject the defendant&#x27;s contention that the\n\ndefendant could not have anticipated the shooting because &quot;the\n\nrobbers targeted sex workers in hotels because they were trying\n\nto avoid resistance, violence, and attention.&quot;38    To begin, it\n\ndoes not inure to the defendant&#x27;s benefit that he chose victims\n\n\n     38The defendant&#x27;s trial counsel made a similar argument in\nclosing.\n\f                                                                  65\n\n\nwhom he thought were particularly vulnerable.   Doing so does not\n\nsupport an argument that he was at all concerned about harming\n\nthe victims.   In any event, that the victims were working as\n\nescorts equally could have supported an inference that they\n\nwould be armed in preparation for any conflict that might arise\n\nin the course of their work.   See Phap Buth, 480 Mass. at 117\n\nn.7 (where defendant argued that victims&#x27; characteristics\n\nsupported inference that defendant would not expect coventurers\n\nto be armed based on need to overcome victim resistance,\n\nvictims&#x27; physical characteristics equally supported inference\n\nthat they would be armed).\n\n     Last, the defendant urges that fundamental principles of\n\ncriminal law surrounding proportionality of criminal liability\n\nto moral culpability require a determination that an accomplice\n\nmust be subjectively aware that his coventurer&#x27;s actions create\n\na plain and strong likelihood of death.   &quot;We consistently have\n\nrejected the argument that the felony-murder rule is\n\nunconstitutional, . . . or that it relieves the Commonwealth of\n\nits obligation to prove a defendant&#x27;s own moral culpability.&quot;\n\nBrown, 477 Mass. at 823.39   As we held in Brown, supra:   &quot;We\n\n\n     39The cases of Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982), and\nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987), cited by the defendant in\nsupport, are inapposite. In Enmund, supra at 797, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment to the\nFederal Constitution did not permit the imposition of the death\npenalty on a defendant who did not himself kill, attempt to\n\f                                                                  66\n\n\ndiscern no reason . . . to accept the defendant&#x27;s invitation\n\nthat we abolish the felony-murder rule.&quot;40\n\n     e.   Jury instructions.   During deliberations, the judge\n\nreceived a question from the jury regarding his felony-murder\n\njury instructions.   The jury asked whether &quot;intended to do an\n\nact&quot; referred to &quot;attempted armed robbery or the discharge of a\n\nfirearm.&quot;   In the discussions with the judge regarding an\n\nappropriate answer, defense counsel acknowledged that depending\n\non &quot;[the] circumstance[s] in which an attempted armed robbery is\n\noccurring, [it] may meet third prong malice&quot; for the purposes of\n\nfelony-murder under Brown.     Nonetheless, he asked that the judge\n\ninstruct the jury that &quot;attempted armed robbery cannot be, in\n\nand of itself . . . the intended act described in element 4(c),&quot;\n\n\n\n\nkill, or intend that a killing take place in his commission of a\nfelony. In so holding, the Court focused on the severity of the\ndeath penalty. Id. In Tison, supra at 154, the Court\ndetermined that there was an &quot;apparent consensus that\nsubstantial participation in a violent felony [in] circumstances\nlikely to result in the loss of innocent human life may justify\nthe death penalty even absent an &#x27;intent to kill.&#x27;&quot; The Court\nheld &quot;that major participation in the felony committed, combined\nwith reckless indifference to human life, is sufficient to\nsatisfy the Enmund culpability requirement.&quot; Id. at 158. As\nboth Enmund and Tison focused on the imposition of the death\npenalty, neither case is pertinent here.\n\n     40Therefore, the jury instruction given by the judge on\nthird prong malice, which the defendant admits tracked the Model\nJury Instructions on Homicide, was accurate.\n\f                                                                   67\n\n\nand that in this case the &quot;act&quot; would be the discharge of a\n\nfirearm.41    The judge&#x27;s written response to the jury provided:\n\n     &quot;You must determine separately for each defendant from the\n     totality of the circumstances which you find occurred\n     whether what occurred constitutes an intent to do an act\n     which in the circumstances known to the defendant a\n     reasonable person would have known created a plain and\n     strong likelihood that death would occur.&quot;42\n\n     The defendant argues that this instruction was insufficient\n\nfollowing Brown, building on his argument that a defendant&#x27;s\n\nintent to commit an armed robbery alone could not establish a\n\nplain and strong likelihood of death, and that the only\n\n\n\n\n     41&quot;Element 4(c)&quot; refers to a portion of the felony-murder\nmodel jury instruction:\n\n     &quot;To prove the defendant guilty of felony-murder in the\n     first degree, the Commonwealth must prove the following\n     elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n     &quot;. . .\n\n     &quot;4.     The defendant:\n\n     &quot;. . .\n\n     &quot;c. intended to do an act which, in the circumstances\n     known to the defendant, a reasonable person would have\n     known created a plain and strong likelihood that death\n     would result.&quot;\n\nModel Jury Instructions on Homicide 59-60 (2018).\n\n     42After hearing the written instruction, defense counsel\nasked whether the judge could include &quot;at the moment of the\ndischarge of the firearm.&quot; The judge declined to do so but\nnoted counsel&#x27;s objection.\n\f                                                                    68\n\n\nintentional act that could have supported his conviction was the\n\nact of shooting Johnson.     The defendant&#x27;s argument is misplaced.\n\n    In Brown, contrary to the defendant&#x27;s contentions, the\n\ncourt did not hold that an armed robbery could never be the act\n\nsupporting a finding of third prong malice.     Rather, the court\n\nheld that commission of the crime of armed robbery (or attempted\n\narmed robbery), in and of itself, is no longer sufficient to\n\nuphold a conviction of felony-murder; one must look to the\n\ncircumstances known to the defendant at the time he committed\n\nsuch an &quot;act.&quot;     Brown, 477 Mass. at 832 (Gants, C.J.,\n\nconcurring).     The court did not define &quot;act&quot; further.   Analyzing\n\nBrown, the &quot;act&quot; could be the shooting of a gun.    The &quot;act&quot;\n\ncould also reasonably be the commission of a dangerous attempted\n\narmed robbery, which a reasonable person would have known\n\ncreated a plain and strong likelihood that death would occur.\n\nAs discussed supra, the evidence supported the jury&#x27;s conclusion\n\nthat the defendant&#x27;s actions throughout his participation in the\n\nattempts to rob Sarah, Emily, and Johnson supported the malice\n\nprong.   There was no error.\n\n    The defendant further argues that the judge inappropriately\n\ninstructed the jury:\n\n    &quot;[A]s a general rule you are permitted but not required to\n    infer that a person who intentionally uses a dangerous\n    weapon on another person intends to kill that person or to\n    cause that person grievous bodily harm or intends to do an\n    act which in the circumstances known to him a reasonable\n\f                                                                    69\n\n\n       person would know creates a plain and strong likelihood\n       that death would result.&quot;\n\nThis instruction comports with the supplemental instructions in\n\nthe Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 105 (2018).    The\n\ndefendant argues that because there was no evidence that the\n\ndefendant knew the gun was loaded or that Jeune intended to\n\nshoot Johnson, the inference that the defendant acted with\n\nmalice based on his knowledge of Jeune&#x27;s use of a gun was\n\nimpermissible.    He relies on Commonwealth v. Colas, 486 Mass.\n\n831 (2021), in making this argument.\n\n       In Colas, 486 Mass. at 835, during a confrontation between\n\ntwo groups, the defendant raised his hand and pointed a gun\n\ntoward another man.    In response, that man fired four or five\n\nshots at the defendant, striking two bystanders, one of whom was\n\nkilled.   Id.   In the unique circumstances of Colas, the court\n\nheld that the defendant&#x27;s pointing of a gun at the man who fired\n\nhis gun in return did not support the jury instruction mentioned\n\nsupra, because it was not &quot;a typical case involving someone\n\nalleged to have shot, stabbed, or clubbed a victim.&quot;    Id. at\n\n843.   Colas is not helpful to the defendant because the evidence\n\nsuggested, as discussed supra, that Johnson was shot\n\f                                                                    70\n\n\nintentionally as part of the joint venture.     This instruction\n\nwas given properly to the jury.43\n\n     f.   Closing argument.   The defendant takes issue with the\n\nprosecutor&#x27;s pattern in closing argument of referencing items\n\nthat were used in the crimes as used and possessed by both\n\ncoventurers.   He points to the following sentences in the\n\nCommonwealth&#x27;s closing argument:\n\n     &quot;They came with a firearm, a weapon.     They had ammunition\n     for that weapon. . . .\n\n     &quot;They had a cell phone, . . . that had no subscriber. . . .\n     They had a smart phone, the Alcatel, that was found in\n     . . . Jeune&#x27;s car. . . .\n\n     &quot;They also had a car, a Toyota Camry, . . . with a\n     different color front passenger side quarter panel, a\n     missing rear hubcap, a different color gas door opener, and\n     a sunroof. . . .\n\n     &quot;[T]hey had ammunition for a handgun, .380 caliber class\n     ammunition, consistent with the bullet that killed . . .\n     Johnson, that was found in the backseat of a Jeep in the\n     driveway at . . . Jeune&#x27;s house.&quot;\n\nWhere the defendant objected to the prosecutor&#x27;s repeated use of\n\nthe word &quot;they&quot; at trial, we review for prejudicial error.\n\nCommonwealth v. Durand, 475 Mass. 657, 670 (2016), cert. denied,\n\n583 U.S. 896 (2017).\n\n\n\n\n     43In the absence of any evidence that the murder of Johnson\nwas an accident, the defendant was not entitled to an\ninstruction on accident. See Commonwealth v. Podkowka, 445\nMass. 692, 699 (2006) (&quot;Where there is no evidence of accident,\nthe issue is not fairly raised and the judge need not give an\naccident instruction&quot;).\n\f                                                                     71\n\n\n    &quot;Under our case law, &#x27;[w]hile prosecutors are entitled to\n\nargue &quot;forcefully for the defendant&#x27;s conviction,&quot; closing\n\narguments must be limited to facts in evidence and the fair\n\ninferences that may be drawn from those facts.&#x27;&quot;     Commonwealth\n\nv. Alvarez, 480 Mass. 299, 305 (2018), quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nRutherford, 476 Mass. 639, 643 (2017).    We examine all the\n\nstatements challenged by the defendant &quot;in the context of the\n\nentire closing, the jury instructions, and the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial.&quot;     Commonwealth v. Kapaia, 490 Mass. 787,\n\n801 (2022), quoting Commonwealth v. Cheng Sun, 490 Mass. 196,\n\n217 (2022).   &quot;Although &#x27;counsel may argue the evidence and the\n\nfair inferences which can be drawn from the evidence,&#x27; . . . &#x27;a\n\nprosecutor should not . . . misstate the evidence or refer to\n\nfacts not in evidence.&#x27;&quot;    Kapaia, supra at 804, quoting Cheng\n\nSun, supra at 221.\n\n    There was no error in the Commonwealth&#x27;s use of the word\n\n&quot;they&quot; in the above statements.     The evidence demonstrated that\n\nas the defendant and Jeune carried out their scheme, they used a\n\nfirearm to subdue their victims.    That firearm evidently\n\ncontained ammunition with which they shot Johnson, and the class\n\nof ammunition found in Jeune&#x27;s Jeep could have been used to kill\n\nJohnson.   Although the statement about the ammunition in Jeune&#x27;s\n\nJeep is a close call, we think the evidence supported the\n\nprosecutor&#x27;s statement.    It is irrelevant that there was no\n\f                                                                   72\n\n\nspecific evidence that the firearm used during the joint venture\n\nwas in the hands of the defendant.    As the two men used a\n\nfirearm to further the joint venture, the prosecutor&#x27;s\n\nstatements were accurate.    Similarly, the cell phone with no\n\nidentified subscriber was used to contact the victims, and the\n\nAlcatel number was used to visit Backpage and communicate with\n\nthe defendant&#x27;s cell phone about the crime.    The Camry was used\n\nto drive the defendant and Jeune to each of the crime scenes.\n\nThere need not be evidence regarding the defendant&#x27;s personal\n\nuse of these devices and the Camry to attribute the items to him\n\nthroughout the joint venture.     &quot;Acts of a joint venturer\n\namounting to consciousness of guilt may be attributed to another\n\njoint venturer if the acts occurred during the course of a joint\n\nventure and in furtherance of it.&quot;     Wardsworth, 482 Mass. at 463\n\nn.16, quoting Commonwealth v. Mahoney, 405 Mass. 326, 330-331\n\n(1989).     See Commonwealth v. Braley, 449 Mass. 316, 321-322\n\n(2007) (actions of joint venturer in disposing of his rifle,\n\nfleeing, and painting his truck attributable to defendant\n\nbecause they were done in furtherance of continuing joint\n\nventure).\n\n    Even if we did hold that the statements were error, any\n\nerror did not prejudice the defendant.     These statements were\n\nspread out over a span of eight pages of transcript in a closing\n\nargument that spanned over thirty pages.    Additionally, the\n\f                                                                  73\n\n\njudge instructed the jury that closing arguments are not\n\nevidence on two separate occasions and explained that he did not\n\nallow the jurors to have their notebooks during closing\n\narguments for that reason.    See Commonwealth v. Lester, 486\n\nMass. 239, 249 (2020) (judge&#x27;s instructions that closing\n\narguments not evidence mitigated error where misstatements were\n\nthirteen words of thirty-three page argument).\n\n    g.    Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.   Finally, we have\n\nreviewed the entire record of this case pursuant to G. L.\n\nc. 278, \u00a7 33E, including but not limited to the remainder of the\n\nissues in the defendant&#x27;s motions to suppress, the admission of\n\nthe Saugus video recording and Sarah&#x27;s testimony, the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s past gun possession as a prior bad act, and the\n\njudge&#x27;s admission of the grand jury testimony of the defendant&#x27;s\n\nformer girlfriend where the judge found she was feigning memory\n\nloss.    We conclude that there is no reason to reduce the\n\ndefendant&#x27;s sentence on his conviction of murder or to order a\n\nnew trial.\n\n    This is not a case such as Brown, 477 Mass. at 824, where\n\nthe defendant was involved in the &quot;remote outer fringes&quot; of the\n\nattempted armed robbery, robbery, and murder.    The defendant\n\nwent to three different hotels in what the evidence showed to be\n\na planned effort to rob escorts at gunpoint with Jeune.      It does\n\nnot move us that Emily testified that the man who did not have\n\f                                                                  74\n\n\nthe gun was &quot;empathetic&quot; to her.   As Jeune kept the gun trained\n\non Emily, the defendant ransacked her room, grabbing her money,\n\nwallet, and marijuana, continuing after Jeune threatened to hurt\n\nEmily if she did not keep quiet.   After the defendant\n\nparticipated in this violent encounter, he went to the\n\nBurlington hotel to do it again, and he was present when the\n\nshot was fired that killed Johnson.   After Johnson was killed,\n\nhe fled the hotel with Jeune and quickly left in the Camry.    See\n\nCommonwealth v. Tillis, 486 Mass. 497, 509 (2020) (defendant\n\nplayed central role where he identified drug dealer to target,\n\ncoordinated with accomplice, planned robbery, and entered\n\napartment building with knife, despite disparity in sentence for\n\nmore culpable accomplice).\n\n                                    Judgments affirmed.\n\f",
