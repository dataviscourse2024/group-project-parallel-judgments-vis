We affirm the final order as to Counts 1, 2, and 4. We reverse regarding Count 3 and affirm the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanctions.\r\n\r\n\tI. Background\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b62\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010 and 2011, while serving as the president of the HOA, McDonnell wrote four checks totaling $10,000 on the HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account payable to himself or to his business, Rocky Mountain Batting Cages (RMBC). As president, McDonnell had authority to sign HOA checks, but he also had a fiduciary duty to ensure that all expenses were approved through the proper administrative channels and that HOA funds were spent only on HOA business. The HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial practice was for the HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treasurer to prepare\u00c2\u00a0a voucher for each expense, identifying the payee and the purpose of the expenditure. The HOA board would then review the vouchers and at least two board members would sign their approval. No vouchers were prepared or board members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 signatures gathered for the $10,000 in checks at issue here. And McDonnell used the check proceeds to pay RMBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating expenses, not for the HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefit.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b63\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 When the HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treasurer, Pam Dees, discovered one of these checks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a $2000 check payable to RMBC \u00e2\u0080\u0094 McDonnell claimed that he had written the check on the HOA account by mistake and promised to repay the HOA in full, which he did shortly thereafter. When Dees\u00e2\u0080\u0099s term as treasurer ended, McDonnell took custody of the HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounting records and did not appoint a new or interim treasurer. Shortly thereafter, Deby Williams, a Pinecliff resident, contacted McDonnell and volunteered to assume the duties of treasurer. McDonnell took no action to call a board meeting to consider Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election and, despite multiple requests by Williams, he refused to provide her access to the HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial records.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b64\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The following year, one HOA board member circulated an e-mail requesting that the board meet to discuss, in part, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cannual financial/treasurer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McDonnell declined to attend the meeting and informed the board that he was resigning. He then deposited the remaining $8000 that he had withdrawn for non-HOA purposes into the HOA bank account.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b65\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, the HOA board discovered the checks that McDonnell had written and reported him to the police department and the Commission. No criminal charges were filed, but the Commission opened an investigation.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b66\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission charged McDonnell with four violations of the Colorado Real Estate Broker License Law:\r\n\r\n\tCount 1: Failing to account for or to remit moneys belonging to others within a reasonable time pursuant to section 12-61-113(1)(g), C.R.S. 2015.\r\n\r\n\tCount 2: Converting, diverting, or commingling the funds of others with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own funds pursuant to section 12\u00c2\u00ad61-113(1)(g.5).\r\n\r\n\tCount 3: Demonstrating unworthiness or incompetency to act as a real estate broker pursuant to section 12\u00c2\u00ad61-113(1)(n).\r\n\r\n\tCount 4: Engaging in dishonest dealing pursuant to section 12-61-113(1)(t).\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b67\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 McDonnell objected to the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jurisdiction to sanction him for conduct that did not involve a real estate matter and denied that he was subject to discipline under any of the four counts.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b68\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 An administrative law judge (AUJ) held an evidentiary hearing and concluded that, in general, the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanction authority extended to certain conduct outside the context of real estate. Whether McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct warranted sanctions under the specific counts charged, however, would depend on the scope of each statutory provision. Accordingly, the AUJ addressed each provision and determined as follows:\r\n\r\n\tCount 1: Section 12-61-113(1)(g) is limited to situations where a licensee fails to account for or remit money in connection with some type of real estate\u00c2\u00a0transaction. McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions do not, therefore, fall within the scope of this section.\r\n\r\n\tCount 2: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing in the language of [section] 12-61\u00c2\u00ad113(1)(g.5) suggests that, to constitute grounds for discipline, an act of conversion must relate to a real estate transaction[,]\u00e2\u0080\u009d and McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions amount to conversion in violation this section.\r\n\r\n\tCount 3: Section 12-61-113(1)(n) applies to situations where a licensee demonstrates unworthiness or incompetency in \u00e2\u0080\u009cconducting business\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the context of real estate. McDonnell was not conducting business and his actions do not, therefore, fall within the scope of this section.\r\n\r\n\tCount 4: \u00e2\u0080\u009c[N]othing in the language of [section] 12-61\u00c2\u00ad113(1)(t) limits its reach to the context of real estate transactions[,]\u00e2\u0080\u009d and McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions amount to dishonest dealing in violation of this section.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b69\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Both parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision with the Commission. The Commission affirmed that McDonnell had\u00c2\u00a0violated section 12-61-113(1)(g.5) (Count 2) and section 12-61\u00c2\u00ad113(1)(t) (Count 4) and agreed with the ALJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasoning on both counts. However, the Commission reversed the ALJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusions as to Counts 1 and 3 and instead concluded:\r\n\r\n\tCount 1: Section 12-61-113(1)(g) (Count 1) permits disciplining a licensee whether \u00e2\u0080\u009cacting as a real estate broker[s] or otherwise[,]\u00e2\u0080\u009d and McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct of failing to account for or remit money belonging to others violates this section.\r\n\r\n\tCount 3: The statutory phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cconducting business\u00e2\u0080\u009d in section 12-61-113(1)(n) includes businesses that are not based in real estate, and McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct of demonstrating unworthiness and incompetency in his business dealings with the HOA and RMBC violates this section.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b610\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 McDonnell now appeals the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order, again contending that the Commission lacked the authority to sanction him under any of the four statutory provisions charged because his\u00c2\u00a0conduct did not concern real estate matters. We agree in part and disagree in part.\r\n\r\n\tII. Standard of Review\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b611\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The standard of review for Commission actions is governed by statute.

Colo. Real Estate Comm\u00e2\u0080\u0099n v. Bartlett, 272 P.3d 1099, 1101 (Colo. App. 2011). When interpreting a statute, we ascertain and give effect to the intent of the General Assembly, looking first to the statute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plain language and according words and phrases their ordinary meanings. Specialty Rests. Corp. v. Nelson, 231 P.3d 393, 397 (Colo. 2010); Colo. Citizens for Ethics in Gov\u00e2\u0080\u0099t v. Comm. for Am. Dream, 187 P.3d 1207, 1220 (Colo. App. 2008). We give effect to every part of the statute and avoid constructions that would render a word, phrase, or provision meaningless. Bartlett, 272 P.3d at 1102.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b613\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 If the plain language is ambiguous, we employ rules of statutory interpretation to resolve the ambiguity. Anderson v. Longmont Toyota, Inc., 102 P.3d 323, 327 (Colo. 2004). We read applicable statutory provisions as a whole to accord consistent, harmonious, and sensible effect to all parts. Id. In harmonizing seemingly conflicting statutes, we consider the consequences of a given construction and the ultimate goal of the statutory scheme. Id. We presume the General Assembly intended just and reasonable results, \u00c2\u00a7 2-4-201(1)(c)-(d), C.R.S. 2015, and we avoid statutory interpretations leading to absurd outcomes, Anderson, 102 P.3d at 327; State v. Nieto, 993 P.2d 493, 501 (Colo. 2000).\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b614\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Finally, we give considerable weight to an agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasonable interpretation of its own enabling statute, but we are not bound by its legal interpretations. Specialty Rests. Corp., 231 P.3d at 397; Anderson, 102 P.3d at 327.\r\n\r\n\tIII.

See \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-101(2)(a), C.R.S. 2015.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b616\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 To ensure that licensed brokers remain \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompeten[t] to transact the business of a real estate broker in such manner as to safeguard the interest of the public,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-102, C.R.S. 2015; see In re Currin, 55 B.R. 928, 933 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1985), the Commission has the authority to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake disciplinary action against [them],\u00e2\u0080\u009d Albright v. McDermond, 14 P.3d 318, 322 (Colo. 2000); see also \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-113(1). Specifically, the Commission can sanction a licensed broker for any of the grounds identified in section 12-61\u00c2\u00ad113(1). Contrary to McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion, some of the grounds identified, by their very terms, do not involve \u00e2\u0080\u009cselling, exchanging, buying, renting, or leasing\u00e2\u0080\u009d real estate, and many others do not involve conduct specific to brokers:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnowingly making any misrepresentation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a7 12-61\u00c2\u00ad113(1)(a).\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u00e2\u0080\u009c[V]iolating any reasonable rule or regulation promulgated by the [C]ommission in the interests of the public.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a7 12\u00c2\u00ad61-113(1)(k).\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cConviction of, entering a plea of guilty to, or entering a plea of nolo contendere to\u00e2\u0080\u009d various crimes under the Colorado Criminal Code, federal law, or the laws of other states. \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-113(1)(m).\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cFailing to immediately notify the [C]ommission in writing of a conviction, plea, or violation pursuant to paragraph (m).\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-113(1)(m.6).\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u00e2\u0080\u009c[H]aving a license, registration, or certification issued by Colorado or another state revoked or suspended for fraud, deceit, material misrepresentation, theft, or the breach of a fiduciary duty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including, but not limited to, a law license or an investment advisor certificate. \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-113(1)(y).\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b617\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The inclusion of these provisions demonstrates that the legislature intended the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanction authority to extend to a broker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improper conduct outside the real estate context, particularly when it speaks to the broker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honesty, dignity, or moral character. See Bartlett, 272 P.3d at 1135 1105 (allowing the Commission to sanction a broker for hiding his sexual assault conviction from oversight because such conduct \u00e2\u0080\u009cindicate[s] a character inconsistent with licensure in a profession that demands scrupulous honesty, strict compliance with the law, and integrity in dealing with others\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Moreover, during a 1975 legislative hearing on proposed amendments to the sanctioning provisions of the Real Estate Broker License Law, House Representative Jack McCroskey acknowledged that the Commission had the authority to punish real estate brokers for conduct outside the real estate context. See Hearing on H.B. 1402 before the H. Judiciary Comm., 50th Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. (Mar. 14, 1975) (statement of Rep. Jack McCroskey). He specifically stated, \u00e2\u0080\u009c[Colorado] courts have already held that if you steal some money even though you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t acting as a real estate broker, you still could have your license revoked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Id.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b618\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Nonetheless, McDonnell contends that in Hart v. Colorado Real Estate Commission, 702 P.2d 763 (Colo. App. 1985), another division of this court expressly limited the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review of a broker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct to matters involving the \u00e2\u0080\u009cselling, exchanging, buying, renting, or leasing of real estate\u00e2\u0080\u009d when it stated, \u00e2\u0080\u009c[t]he Commission is empowered to review actions concerning the \u00e2\u0080\u0098selling, exchanging, buying, renting, or leasing of real estate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Id. at 765 (quoting \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-101(2)(a)).\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b619\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 This statement does not limit the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review to only those enumerated actions. In Hart, the Commission sanctioned a real estate broker for making \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstantial and willful misrepresentations\u00e2\u0080\u009d and for engaging in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdishonest dealing\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the context of negotiating a bridge loan. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The broker argued that the Commission exceeded its sanction authority because the bridge loan transaction did not require broker licensure. Id. The Hart division disagreed, reading the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanction authority expansively to include the power to regulate \u00e2\u0080\u009cselling, exchanging, buying, renting, or leasing\u00e2\u0080\u009d real estate, along with the power to discipline brokers \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor related [real estate] activities which do not require a license.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Nothing in the Hart opinion suggests that the Commission could not also sanction a real estate broker for dishonesty or willful misrepresentations outside the context of real estate, nor were those specific facts before the division. To conclude otherwise would contradict the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad,\u00c2\u00a0statutorily-granted sanction authority outlined in section 12-61\u00c2\u00ad113(1).

Broad sanction authority is not uncommon in the context of professional licensure. See, e.g., Colo. RPC 8.4 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: . . . (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; . . .

See \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-102. In addition, real estate brokers, who are regularly entrusted with access to others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funds, stand in a fiduciary relationship with their clients and must therefore demonstrate the qualities of good faith, loyalty, and fidelity.

We disagree.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b626\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The section plainly grants the Commission the power to sanction a licensee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct whether he is \u00e2\u0080\u009cacting as [a] real estate broker[] or otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-113(1)(g). That the General Assembly chose to include the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cor otherwise\u00e2\u0080\u009d indicates its intention to discipline brokers for failing to account or remit others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funds, even in non-real estate transactions. See Nieto, 993 P.2d at\u00c2\u00a0500 (\u00e2\u0080\u009c[S]tatute[s] should be construed as written, giving full effect to the words chosen, as it is presumed that the General Assembly meant what it clearly said.\u00e2\u0080\u009d). To interpret the statute otherwise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as applying only when a licensee is acting as a broker in the real estate context \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would render the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cor otherwise\u00e2\u0080\u009d superfluous, and we generally reject such interpretations. See People v.

See Springer v. City &amp; Cnty. of Denver, 13 P.3d 794, 804 (Colo. 2000) (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere the legislature could have chosen to restrict the application of a statute, but chose not to, we do not read additional\u00c2\u00a0restrictions into the statute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d). For example, section 12-61-113(1)(j) expressly limits sanctions to instances where a licensee is \u00e2\u0080\u009cperforming any of the functions of a real estate broker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Section 12-61-113(q) is similarly limited to instances where a broker claims an undisclosed amount of compensation or profit \u00e2\u0080\u009cin connection with any acts for which a [real estate] license is required.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See Anderson, 102 P.3d at 327 (we read applicable statutory provisions as a whole).\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b628\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 McDonnell nonetheless contends that the recordkeeping requirements contained in section 12-61-113(1)(g) indicate that the section applies only to conduct related to real estate matters. We disagree that these requirements so limit the reach of the statute. The statute states that records of transactions involving others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 money \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall contain such information as may be prescribed by the rules of the [C]ommission relative thereto and shall be subject to audit by the [C]ommission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a7 12-61-113(1)(g) (emphasis added). This language plainly requires a licensee, whether acting as a real estate broker or otherwise, to keep records according to the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules that are relevant to the conduct at issue.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b629\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 McDonnell cites only the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules that are applicable when he is acting as a real estate broker, not rules that apply when he acts \u00e2\u0080\u009cotherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules and regulations do not address the specific recordkeeping requirements that would apply when a licensee acts \u00e2\u0080\u009cotherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It would be impossible to have specific rules for all conceivable actions involving records. See, e.g., \u00c2\u00a7 7-136-101(2), (5)(h), C.R.S. 2015 (requiring a nonprofit corporation to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaintain appropriate accounting records[,]\u00e2\u0080\u009d including all financial statements under section 7-136\u00c2\u00ad106, C.R.S. 2015); \u00c2\u00a7 12-2-123(1), C.R.S. 2015 (detailing grounds for sanctioning a certified public accountant, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfailure to retain records of the work performed for each client\u00e2\u0080\u009d). But, the fact that there are no separate administrative rules detailing the precise recordkeeping requirements does not mean that such conduct is beyond the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulation. See Dep\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of Regulatory Agencies Reg. 725, 4 Code Colo.

And, the AUJ and the Commission found that McDonnell kept no records at all. McDonnel does not dispute this finding, and the record clearly supports it. See Hart, 702 P.2d at 765. Aside from check stubs, nothing in the record indicates that McDonnell prepared any financial vouchers, obtained any HOA board signatures, or kept any other financial records relative to the $10,000 that he took from the HOA. Instead, the record supports the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings, as adopted from the AUJ, that McDonnell purposefully withheld evidence of his withdrawals and personal expenditures from HOA oversight.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b631\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We therefore conclude that, under section 12-61-113(1)(g), the Commission had the authority to sanction McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-real estate conduct.\r\n\r\n\tV.

The Commission, adopting the ALJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings, decided that McDonnell took HOA funds without authorization from the HOA, exercised dominion over those funds, and used those funds to pay the operating expenses of his personal business, RMBC. The Commission then concluded that McDonnell converted money in violation of section 12-61-113(1)(g.5) as soon as he withdrew funds from the HOA account without the HOA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission. Because there is substantial evidence in the record to support this determination, we cannot conclude that it was arbitrary, capricious, or legally impermissible.

The AUJ and the Commission found that McDonnell withdrew HOA funds without authorization or credible justification, that he purposefully hid the withdrawals from HOA oversight, that he used the funds for non-HOA purposes, and that he repaid the funds only after realizing that his malfeasance would likely be discovered. Because substantial evidence supports these findings, we decline to disturb them on review. See Hart, 702 P.2d at 765; Seibel v. Colo. Real Estate Comm\u00e2\u0080\u0099n, 34 Colo.

The Attorney General disagrees, arguing that McDonnell was conducting HOA and RMBC business and that, pursuant to Eckley v. Colorado Real Estate Commission, 752 P.2d 68, 74 (Colo. 1988), section 12-61-113(1)(n) includes any dishonest, deceitful, or ethically objectionable acts that are antithetical to the real estate profession or to real estate brokers.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b645\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We conclude that section 12-61-113(1)(n) does not reach McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct. The Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administrative rules and regulations, see Dep\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of Regulatory Agencies Reg. 725, 4 Code Colo.

Rule G-7 provides:\r\n\r\n\tPursuant to 12-61-113(1)(n), C.R.S., a licensee . . . shall be considered unworthy or incompetent in the conduct of their business where:\r\n\r\n\t(a) The licensee violates Rule G-6.2\r\n\r\n\t(b) With particular respect to media advertising:\r\n\r\n\t(1) The property is not actually located in the area represented.\r\n\r\n\t(2) The rental price shown is less than that asked by the owner of the available property.\r\n\r\n\t(3) The property is non-existent or cannot be verified as currently for rent by the licensee.\r\n\r\n\t(4) The specifics of the property advertised differ materially from the property as it exists.\r\n\r\n\t(5) A property is advertised in such a way or under such a heading as to indicate the property is of a different type than it actually is. The word \u00e2\u0080\u009ctype\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to such designations as: single family detached residence, duplex, apartment, condominium, townhouse, or mobile home.\r\n\r\n\t(c) The licensee fails or refuses to abide by the terms of the contract or receipt between himself and a prospective purchaser.\r\n\r\n\t(d) The broker fails or refuses to refund money pursuant to the terms of the contract or receipt.\r\n\r\n\t(e) The broker has failed to keep accurate records as specified in these rules or has failed to retain said records for the prescribed time periods.\r\n\r\n\tNothing in this exhaustive list incorporates McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions or any other conduct outside the context of real estate.

In Eckley, the Commission\u00c2\u00a0charged a real estate broker with professional misconduct under section 12-61-113(1)(n) based on his actions and omissions in the sale of a tavern \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a real estate transaction. That case, therefore, dealt with a broker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unworthiness and incompetence in the real estate context. Here, the Commission charged McDonnell for conduct unrelated to real estate, rendering Eckley inapplicable.\r\n\r\n\t\u00c2\u00b647\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We therefore conclude that the Commission did not have the authority to punish McDonnell under section 12-61-113(1)(n) because his charged conduct was unrelated to real estate and did not fall within any of the punishable grounds listed in Rule G-7. We accordingly reverse the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order as to Count 3.\r\n\r\n\tVII.

Section 12-61\u00c2\u00ad113(1)(t) plainly states that it applies to \u00e2\u0080\u009c[a]ny other conduct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and we see nothing in the remainder of the section, or in the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administrative rules and regulations, limiting its reach. The General Assembly or the Commission could have limited the scope of this section to apply only to real estate dealings, but neither chose to do so.

The Commission also adopted the AUJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determination that McDonnell misappropriated $10,000 from the HOA for personal use without disclosing or returning the funds until his inappropriate conduct was at risk of being discovered. These findings are supported by substantial record evidence and will not be disturbed on review. See Hart, 702 P.2d at 765. Based on these findings, the Commission concluded that McDonnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct constituted \u00e2\u0080\u009cdishonest dealing\u00e2\u0080\u009d in violation of section 12\u00c2\u00ad61-113(1)(t).

Because the Commission changed the violations but left the sanctions untouched, we are not convinced that, on remand, the Commission would alter any sanctions based on a reversal on Count 3. Moreover, the sanctions do not appear excessive, nor do they constitute an abuse of discretion. See Bartlett, 272 P.3d at 1105. We therefore conclude that a remand for reconsideration of the sanctions is unnecessary and thus affirm the original sanctions imposed by the Commission.3\r\n\r\n\tIX.
