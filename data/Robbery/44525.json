This appeal concerns a violation of\nthe Speedy Trial Act that occurred due to delays transporting\nRoman Lloyd to his mental competency evaluation. The gov-\nernment conceded that over seventy nonexcludable days\nelapsed, and the district court dismissed the case. However,\nthe district court exercised its discretion to dismiss it without\nprejudice. As a result, the government promptly brought the\nsame charges again. Lloyd pleaded guilty but reserved his\n\f2                                                  No. 22-1126\n\nright to challenge the district court\u2019s decision not to dismiss\nthe original indictment with prejudice.\n   Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndismissing Lloyd\u2019s indictment without prejudice, we a\ufb03rm.\n\n                      I.   Background\n\n    A. Credit Union Robbery and Subsequent Flight\n   On March 27, 2019, Lloyd walked into the Ascentra Credit\nUnion in Moline, Illinois. Covered from head to toe, he ap-\nproached the teller and told her, \u201cThis is a bank robbery. I\nneed $20,000.\u201d The teller gathered a total of $16,878 from her\ndrawer and the drawers of three adjacent tellers. Cash in\nhand, Lloyd left the credit union, and someone called 911.\n    Shortly thereafter, police officers located Lloyd\u2019s vehicle\nand attempted a traffic stop. Lloyd refused to pull over, and\na high-speed chase ensued, reaching speeds of approximately\n100 miles per hour, zigzagging between Illinois and Iowa.\nLloyd drove through residential neighborhoods, school zones\n(while school was in session), and in the wrong direction\ndown one-way streets. Officers eventually managed to slow\nhim to about sixty miles per hour by using stop sticks (a de-\nvice put on the road in front of a moving vehicle to deflate the\ntires) and then used a PIT (precision immobilization tech-\nnique) maneuver to stop Lloyd\u2019s vehicle in a ditch. Fortu-\nnately, no one was hurt, including Lloyd.\n    B. Arraignment and Competency Evaluation\n    Lloyd was indicted on one count of credit union robbery\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and one count of transporting sto-\nlen money interstate under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. On July 11, 2019,\nhe was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. The same day, the\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                    3\n\ndistrict court set a pretrial conference for August 28, 2019, and\ntrial for September 9, 2019.\n    Since this case is about the delays in bringing Lloyd to\ntrial, a brief overview of the Speedy Trial Act helps put the\nprocedural events in context. \u201cIn any case in which a plea of\nnot guilty is entered,\u201d the Speedy Trial Act commands that\n\u201cthe trial of [the] defendant \u2026 commence within seventy\ndays\u201d of the filing of the indictment or the defendant\u2019s ar-\nraignment, \u201cwhichever date last occurs.\u201d 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3161(c)(1). However, the Act provides exceptions under\nwhich some \u201cperiods of delay\u201d are \u201cexcluded\u201d and do not\ncount toward the seventy-day limit. Id. \u00a7 3161(h). Relevant to\nLloyd\u2019s appeal, \u201cdelay resulting from \u2026 any examinations[]\nto determine the mental competency \u2026 of the defendant\u201d is\nexcluded. Id. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(A) (\u201cCompetency Examination Ex-\nception\u201d). In addition, time spent transporting a defendant\n\u201cto and from places of examination\u201d is excluded under the\nAct, except that \u201cany time consumed in excess of ten days\nfrom the date [of] \u2026 an order directing such transportation,\nand the defendant\u2019s arrival at the destination shall be pre-\nsumed to be unreasonable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) (\u201cTransporta-\ntion Exception\u201d). Any days in excess of those ten days are pre-\nsumptively nonexcludable and count toward the seventy-day\nclock.\n    We return now to the facts. At the pretrial conference on\nAugust 28, 2019, and at a subsequent pretrial conference on\nOctober 9, 2019, Lloyd\u2019s counsel requested continuances. The\ncourt granted both, finding that they were \u201cin the interest of\njustice\u201d and excluded the time under the Speedy Trial Act. See\nid. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) (excluding delays related to a continuance\nwhen the \u201cthe ends of justice served by taking such action\n\f4                                                   No. 22-1126\n\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in\na speedy trial\u201d). Trial was set for December 30, 2019, but on\nNovember 19, 2019, Lloyd\u2019s attorney filed a motion seeking a\ncompetency evaluation to determine whether Lloyd was com-\npetent to stand trial, as well as whether he was sane at the\ntime of the robbery. The district court orally granted the mo-\ntion and specified:\n       I will also direct the marshals to transport the\n       defendant to the designated evaluation facil-\n       ity.\u2026 [T]he time between now and the resolu-\n       tion of the motion\u2014or the fitness concern shall\n       be excluded pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act,\n       pursuant to the statutory authority.\nThe court did not mention the Transportation Exception.\n    The same day, the court directed Lloyd\u2019s counsel to sub-\nmit a written order memorializing the ruling and subse-\nquently entered the order on November 22, 2019. The order\ninstructed the Attorney General to arrange for the compe-\ntency evaluation to be \u201cconducted in a suitable facility closest\nto the Court.\u201d Relevant to the Speedy Trial Act, the order\nstated:\n       [P]ursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(A) [the\n       Competency Examination Exception], the pe-\n       riod of time from when defense counsel filed the\n       motion to determine competency to when the\n       Court enters an order finding the defendant\n       competent is excluded for purposes of calculat-\n       ing the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights.\n   Although the district court entered this order on Novem-\nber 22, 2019, Lloyd did not arrive at the site of his examination\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                   5\n\nuntil February 27, 2020. Shortly thereafter, the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic struck. Lloyd\u2019s competency evaluation was eventually\ncompleted on May 8, 2020, the psychologist\u2019s report was fi-\nnalized on May 26, 2020, and Lloyd was returned to the Knox\nCounty Jail on July 1, 2020. On September 23, 2020, the district\ncourt conducted a hearing and found that Lloyd was compe-\ntent.\n   C. Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act\n    In the months after Lloyd was found competent, his trial\ndate was continued several times so the government could\nproduce discovery and Lloyd\u2019s attorney could prepare for\ntrial. The parties agree that each time the trial was pushed\nback, the district court correctly excluded the delay from the\nSpeedy Trial Act calculation because the ends of justice were\nserved by granting the continuance. See 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A).\n    Then, on April 26, 2021, Lloyd filed a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment with prejudice pursuant to the Speedy Trial\nAct. See id. \u00a7 3162(a)(2). Lloyd argued that the time (in excess\nof ten days) it took to transport him to and from his compe-\ntency evaluation was not excluded from the Act\u2019s count, pur-\nsuant to the Competency Evaluation Exception. When com-\nbined with the forty-eight days between his arraignment and\nthe first pretrial conference, Lloyd contended that many more\nthan seventy countable days had elapsed.\n   The district court held a hearing on Lloyd\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on July 8, 2021. At the hearing, the court agreed that a\nSpeedy Trial Act violation occurred and dismissed the case.\nNonetheless, the court exercised its discretion under the Act\nand dismissed the case without prejudice, which permitted\n\f6                                                              No. 22-1126\n\nthe government to bring the same two charges against Lloyd\nshortly thereafter.\n   Once Lloyd was reindicted, he pleaded guilty to both\ncrimes but reserved the right to challenge the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of the original indictment without prejudice. Lloyd\nnow appeals that decision.\n\n                          II.     Discussion\n\n    The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court\nabused its discretion when it decided to dismiss the indict-\nment without prejudice, which permitted the government to\nre-indict Lloyd. 1\n    A. Standard of Review\n   The Speedy Trial Act mandates that, \u201c[i]f a defendant is\nnot brought to trial within the time limit required by section\n3161(c) as extended by section 3161(h), the information or in-\ndictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\u201d\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2). Dismissal is required, but, the Act\ngrants the district court discretion regarding whether to dis-\nmiss the indictment with or without prejudice. There is no\npresumption in favor of either outcome. United States v.\n\n    1 It is worth briefly noting what is not at issue. First, despite complain-\n\ning on appeal about delays in transporting Lloyd to and from his compe-\ntency evaluation, Lloyd does not appeal the district court\u2019s conclusion that\nthe delay in returning him to Knox County was reasonable in light of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Second, the government concedes the Act was vio-\nlated. Last, at the district court, the government agreed with Lloyd\u2019s inter-\npretation of the interplay between the Competency Examination Excep-\ntion (\u00a7 3161(h)(1)(A)), and the Transportation Exception (\u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F)).\nBecause Lloyd does not appeal the district court\u2019s finding of a violation,\nwe do not need to reach this issue.\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                      7\n\nTaylor, 487 U.S. 326, 334\u221235 (1988). The Act sets forth three fac-\ntors, \u201camong others,\u201d that a court should consider in exercis-\ning that discretion: (1) \u201cthe seriousness of the offense;\u201d (2)\n\u201cthe facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dis-\nmissal;\u201d and (3) \u201cthe impact of a reprosecution on the admin-\nistration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.\u201d\n\u00a7 3162(a)(2).\n    \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss without\nprejudice for abuse of discretion.\u201d United States v. Sykes, 614\nF.3d 303, 309 (7th Cir. 2010). A district court\u2019s discretion over\nwhether to dismiss with prejudice is \u201csubstantial.\u201d Id.; see also\nUnited States v. Smith, 576 F.3d 681, 691 (7th Cir. 2009) (noting\nthat \u201can \u2018open-ended list\u2019 of the sort drawn up by Congress\nin Section 3162 \u2018imbues a court with great discretion\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning United States v. Fountain, 840 F.2d 509, 512 (7th Cir. 1988))).\nStill, the Speedy Trial Act \u201cconfines the district court\u2019s discre-\ntion more narrowly than in cases where no factors exist.\u201d\nUnited States v. Killingsworth, 507 F.3d 1087, 1090 (7th Cir.\n2007). The Supreme Court has cautioned that, \u201c[a]lthough the\nrole of an appellate court is not to substitute its judgment for\nthat of the trial court, [its] review must serve to ensure that\nthe purposes of the Act and the legislative compromise it re-\nflects are given effect.\u201d Taylor, 487 U.S. at 336. Those purposes\ninclude \u201cserv[ing] the public interest by \u2026 reducing defend-\nants\u2019 opportunity to commit crimes while on pretrial release\nand preventing extended pretrial delay from impairing the\ndeterrent effect of punishment.\u201d Zedner v. United States, 547\nU.S. 489, 501 (2006). Thus, we must \u201cundertake more substan-\ntive scrutiny to ensure that the judgment is supported in\nterms of the factors identified in the statute.\u201d Taylor, 487 U.S.\nat 337. Still, the Supreme Court has instructed, \u201c[W]hen the\nstatutory factors are properly considered, and supporting\n\f8                                                    No. 22-1126\n\nfactual findings are not clearly in error, the district court\u2019s\njudgment of how opposing considerations balance should not\nlightly be disturbed.\u201d Id. Our review for abuse of discretion\nis, therefore, still \u201cdeferential.\u201d Fountain, 840 F.2d at 512.\n    B. The Speedy Trial Act Factors\n   Courts balance the three factors articulated in the Act to\ndetermine whether an indictment should be dismissed with\nprejudice or without.\n       1. Seriousness of the Offense\n    The first factor, the seriousness of the offense, is largely\nself-explanatory. It asks the district court to determine, by re-\nlying on its experience, whether the offense is serious com-\npared to other federal crimes. Cf. Taylor, 487 U.S. at 337\u201338\n(finding \u201cno reason to doubt the court\u2019s conclusion\u201d that\n\u201cdrug violations\u201d were serious); Sykes, 614 F.3d at 310 (\u201cThe\njudge accurately characterized bank robbery as \u2018quite seri-\nous.\u2019\u201d). We have cautioned, though, that the mere fact that no\none was injured during the commission of the crime is insuf-\nficient to support a finding that an otherwise grave offense\n(such as possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-traf-\nficking crime) weighs in favor of dismissal with prejudice. See\nKillingsworth, 507 F.3d at 1090. We have also observed that\n\u201c[t]he \u2018penalty\u2019 imposed on the prosecutor (and the rest of so-\nciety) by dismissing with prejudice rises with the seriousness\nof the crime.\u201d Fountain, 840 F.2d at 512. Thus, where a crime\nis serious, \u201cthe sanction of dismissal with prejudice\nshould \u2026 be imposed only for a correspondingly serious de-\nlay.\u201d United States v. Carreon, 626 F.2d 528, 533 (7th Cir. 1980).\n    Regarding the seriousness of Lloyd\u2019s offense, the court\nstated, \u201cThe case is serious, from what I know about it.\u201d The\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                     9\n\ncourt explained, \u201c[W]hile all felony federal cases are seri-\nous, \u2026 I would put unarmed bank robbery kind of in the mid-\ndle of serious. Not the most by any means, and the potential\npenalties in an unarmed bank robbery are not as high as many\nof the other types of violent crime cases that we see, but it\u2019s\ncertainly a serious offense.\u201d Like the Supreme Court in Taylor,\n\u201c[w]e have no reason to doubt the court\u2019s conclusion in that\nregard.\u201d 487 U.S. at 338.\n    On appeal, Lloyd tries to minimize the seriousness of his\nconduct, arguing that an offense \u201c\u2018in the middle of seri-\nous\u2019 \u2026 is, by definition, neither serious nor non-serious.\u201d But\nthat is not what the district court said; it determined that the\noffense was, indeed, \u201cserious,\u201d and Lloyd\u2019s counsel admitted\nas much in arguing his motion to dismiss when he said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nan unarmed bank robbery, a serious offense \u2026.\u201d The facts ar-\nticulated in Lloyd\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report\u2014which\nLloyd did not object to\u2014confirm this. We agree with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s conclusion regarding the gravity of the offense.\nLloyd\u2019s flight through school zones and residential areas was,\nas the district court aptly characterized during sentencing,\n\u201creally alarming and disturbing behavior.\u201d\n    We have not hesitated to reverse a dismissal with preju-\ndice where a district court \u201cundervalued this factor \u2026.\u201d Kill-\ningsworth, 507 F.3d at 1090. Killingsworth instructs that courts\nmust look at the totality of a crime, not just the end result. See\nid. (reversing dismissal with prejudice, in part because \u201cthe\ndistrict court undervalued [the seriousness of the offense] fac-\ntor by stating that while the offense was serious and involved\na gun, there was no murder or injury\u201d). Lloyd attempts to dis-\ntinguish his conduct from Killingsworth\u2019s, highlighting that\nhe was not in possession of a firearm; however, his conduct is\n\f10                                                   No. 22-1126\n\narguably more serious since he endangered many more peo-\nple in his multi-state, high-speed car chase through school\nzones and residential neighborhoods, even if, like in Kill-\ningsworth, no one was hurt. A serious offense is not rendered\nnonserious by serendipitous lack of injury.\n   Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nwhen it determined that Lloyd\u2019s offense was serious and\nweighed in favor of dismissal without prejudice.\n       2. Facts and Circumstances Leading to Dismissal\n    Turning to the second Speedy Trial Act factor, when ana-\nlyzing the facts and circumstances leading to dismissal, a\ncourt should consider the length of delay and the conduct of\nthe relevant actors. The \u201clength of delay\u201d is \u201ca measure of the\nseriousness of the speedy trial violation \u2026.\u201d Taylor, 487 U.S.\nat 340. Nonetheless, \u201cthere are no bright-line rules,\u201d and even\na lengthy delay \u201cdoes not by itself require dismissal with prej-\nudice.\u201d Sykes, 614 F.3d at 310 (affirming dismissal without\nprejudice even though 224 nonexcludable days had elapsed).\n    Lloyd frames the inquiry under the second factor as\n\u201cwhether the government or the defendant is more to blame for\nthe delay.\u201d United States v. Schreane, 331 F.3d 548, 554 (6th Cir.\n2003) (emphasis added) (alteration omitted) (quoting Doggett\nv. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 651 (1992)). But that framework\nis meant for alleged violations of the constitutional speedy trial\nright. See id. at 552\u201353. Under the Act, in contrast, actions by\nboth parties\u2014the defense and the prosecution\u2014are relevant.\nThe Supreme Court emphasized that whether the govern-\nment \u201cacted in bad faith\u201d or demonstrated a \u201cpattern of ne-\nglect[,] \u2026 suggesting something more than an isolated unwit-\nting violation, would clearly \u2026 alter[] the balance [of this\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                  11\n\nfactor].\u201d Taylor, 487 U.S. at 339. As for the defense\u2019s conduct,\nwe have explained that \u201c[a] defendant who waits passively\nwhile the time runs has less claim to dismissal with prejudice\nthan does a defendant who demands, but does not receive,\nprompt attention.\u201d Fountain, 840 F.2d at 513.\n    The district court identified the second factor as the \u201cmain\nfocus\u201d of its decision to dismiss the case without prejudice. It\nfirst considered the length of the delay for purposes of deter-\nmining whether a Speedy Trial Act violation had occurred.\nThe court focused particularly on Lloyd\u2019s transportation to\nand from the competency evaluation. On the one hand, it\nfound that the delay that occurred during Lloyd\u2019s return trip\n\u201cwas reasonable under the unique circumstances of the pan-\ndemic.\u201d On the other hand, it found that the government\nfailed to provide any evidence why it \u201cshould consider [the\ndelay in transporting Lloyd to the evaluation] reasonable \u2026\n[other] than \u2026 a resource argument \u2026.\u201d The court thus deter-\nmined there was not \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to consider the\ntransportation \u201cdelay above and beyond the ten days [al-\nlowed by statute] \u2026 reasonable.\u201d Ultimately, the court con-\ncluded that the Act was violated because 106 nonexcludable\ndays accrued.\n    The court also considered the length of the delay in weigh-\ning the second factor and determining whether dismissal\nshould be with prejudice or without. Since we have held that\na delay exceeding 200 nonexcludable days does not neces-\nsarily require a dismissal with prejudice, a delay of 106 days\ndoes not signal that the district court abused its discretion on\nthis factor either. See Sykes, 614 F.3d at 310; see also United\nStates v. Arango, 879 F.2d 1501, 1508 (7th Cir. 1989)\n\f12                                                  No. 22-1126\n\n(concluding that a three-month delay is not \u201cper se \u2018substan-\ntial\u2019 enough to justify dismissing the charges with prejudice\u201d).\n    Evaluating the parties\u2019 conduct leading to the violation of\nthe Act, the district court expressed considerable frustration\nwith \u201cthe length of time it takes for these competency evalu-\nations to be conducted\u201d and found that \u201cthe time before\n[transportation was] implemented\u201d took \u201ctoo long \u2026 in this\ncase.\u201d The court also considered conduct on the defense\nside\u2014specifically, not objecting earlier to Lloyd\u2019s delayed\ntransportation. The court noted that, although no party has a\n\u201cmagic ball\u201d allowing them to anticipate \u201cpotential prob-\nlems,\u201d it was struck by \u201cthe lack of objection or even discus-\nsion regarding how the transport was going to occur and the\ntimeline\u201d given how widespread these sorts of transportation\ndelays are.\n    Lloyd protests the district court\u2019s decision to factor de-\nfense conduct into the analysis, arguing that \u201cthe district\ncourt\u2019s reasoning under this factor is patently flawed because\nthe government bears the entire responsibility for the delay.\u201d\nAs Lloyd sees it, he is being penalized for his counsel\u2019s pro-\nposed order concerning the competency evaluation which did\nnot mention the possibility of counting delays related to trans-\nportation. Lloyd insists that he had no means of objecting to a\n\u201chypothetical violation of [the Transportation Exception] be-\nfore it ever occurred \u2026.\u201d In addition, he says he \u201chad no ob-\nligation to discuss \u2018the timeline of [the transport] because [the\nTransportation Exception] tells the government what that\ntimeline is.\u201d\n   While Lloyd is correct that the Department of Justice was\nthe sole party responsible for coordinating his transportation\nto the site of his mental competency evaluation, defense\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                                13\n\nconduct is a relevant consideration under the second factor.\nThe statute directs courts to consider \u201cthe facts and circum-\nstances \u2026 which led to the dismissal\u201d and does not cabin that\ninquiry to actions by the government. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2);\nsee also Taylor, 487 U.S. at 339 (considering the defendant\u2019s\n\u201cfailure to appear\u201d for trial on the \u201c69th day of the indictment-\nto-trial period\u201d). Here, those facts and circumstances include\nLloyd\u2019s belated objection to the transportation delays.\n    Lloyd\u2019s argument that the district court blamed him for\nnot informing the government about the law, or objecting to\nthe order, 2 ignores the district court\u2019s colloquy with the gov-\nernment and its dismissal of the indictment. The judge ad-\nmonished the government, \u201cyou were tasked with knowledge\nof the law, and even if \u2026 my oral ruling and my written order\n[prepared by defense counsel] didn\u2019t specifically address [the\nTransportation Exception], \u2026 why would you\u2014should you\nbe able to \u2026 avoid the implications of the other subsection of\nthe statute?\u201d In response, the government admitted that it is\n\u201ctasked with being aware of every aspect of law.\u201d The court\nthen held the government responsible for the delay by\n\n\n    2 Lloyd frames this argument as the district court blaming him for not\n\nobjecting to a \u201chypothetical violation of \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) before it ever oc-\ncurred.\u201d But, as Lloyd\u2019s counsel argued in support of the motion to dis-\nmiss, by the time Lloyd arrived in Lexington on February 27, 2020, the\nnumber of nonexcludable days had already exceeded 100. The motion to\ndismiss was not filed until April 26, 2021. So, even if Lloyd\u2019s counsel did\nnot foresee the government\u2019s forthcoming violation of the Act in Novem-\nber 2019 when the competency evaluation was ordered, this objection\ncould have been raised far earlier. Cf. Fountain, 840 F.2d at 513 (noting that\na defendant who \u201cwaits passively while the time runs has less claim to\ndismissal with prejudice than does a defendant who demands, but does\nnot receive, prompt attention\u201d).\n\f14                                                   No. 22-1126\n\nrejecting its excuse that it relied on the text of the order and\nfinding that the Act was violated.\n    In the same colloquy, however, the government explained\nthat the delay was inadvertent: \u201c[T]he marshals [in charge of\narranging Lloyd\u2019s transportation] \u2026 relied on the order, and\nthey believed that the time [for transportation] had been ex-\ncluded [under the Speedy Trial Act].\u201d While the government\nis charged with knowledge of the law, it explained, \u201c[W]e\u2019re\nall humans \u2026.\u201d It added, \u201cthe [U.S. Attorney\u2019s] Office is be-\ncoming acutely aware of\u201d this issue and is \u201ctrying to proac-\ntively address it.\u201d The district court was entitled to factor this\nproffer of inadvertence into its analysis and weigh it in favor\nof dismissing without prejudice. See Killingsworth, 507 F.3d at\n1090\u201391 (explaining that the district court \u201coveremphasized\u201d\nthat the defendant \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and underempha-\nsized that the government \u201cdid not intentionally cause the de-\nlay\u201d); Carreon, 626 F.2d at 533 (factor weighed in favor of dis-\nmissal without prejudice where \u201cthe government did not in-\ntentionally seek delay\u201d); Sykes, 614 F.3d at 310 (\u201cThe court also\ncorrectly considered the absence of fault on the part of the\ngovernment.\u201d).\n    What Lloyd fails to appreciate is that dismissal without\nprejudice is often appropriate where neither the government\nnor the defendant is \u201cat fault for failing to move the case\nalong.\u201d Killingsworth, 507 F.3d at 1090. Also, by repeatedly\nframing the district court\u2019s decision as holding that \u201cthe facts\nand circumstances of this case favor the government,\u201d (em-\nphasis added), Lloyd overlooks the fact that the Act\u2019s calculus\nis not a zero-sum game, and the Act has multiple purposes.\nCongress aimed to \u201cprotect and promote speedy trial inter-\nests that go beyond the rights of the defendant\u201d\u2014in contrast\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                    15\n\nto the Sixth Amendment, which \u201cprimarily safeguards the de-\nfendant\u2019s speedy trial right\u2014which may or may not be in ac-\ncord with society\u2019s [interests].\u201d Zedner, 547 U.S. at 501 (empha-\nsis added) (quoting S. Rep. No. 96-212, at 29 (1979)). As we\nhave noted, dismissing a case with prejudice imposes a \u201cpen-\nalty\u201d on society in addition to prosecutors, and even a blame-\nless defendant\u2019s conduct is relevant when deciding the appro-\npriate penalty. See Fountain, 840 F.2d at 512\u201313; see also United\nStates v. Loera, 565 F.3d 406, 411 (7th Cir. 2009) (affirming dis-\nmissal without prejudice where \u201cboth parties requested con-\ntinuances; [the defendant] suffered no significant prejudice;\nand there was nothing to indicate bad faith on the part of the\ngovernment\u201d).\n    Lloyd\u2019s reliance on other cases in which transportation\ntook longer than ten days is also misplaced. As the govern-\nment correctly pointed out in response, the Transportation\nException only presumptively caps the excludable amount of\ntransportation time at ten days; the government may rebut\nthat presumption (as it did here when the delay on Lloyd\u2019s\nreturn trip was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). Moreo-\nver, the government has seventy nonexcludable days within\nwhich to bring a defendant to trial. Even if transportation\ntakes longer than ten days, it does not automatically result in\na violation of the Act\u2014it only accrues toward the seventy-day\ncap.\n    Furthermore, as the government noted during the motion\nto dismiss hearing, there is a plausible argument that a court\ncould exclude some unreasonable travel delays from the\nspeedy trial count if \u201cthe ends of justice served by taking such\naction outweigh the best interest of the public and the defend-\nant in a speedy trial.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A); see United\n\f16                                                  No. 22-1126\n\nStates v. Turner, 602 F.3d 778, 785 (6th Cir. 2010) (holding the\nAct was violated when the government took more than ten\ndays to transport the defendant and did \u201cnot rebut the pre-\nsumption of unreasonableness,\u201d but clarifying that its \u201chold-\ning limits only automatic exclusion under \u00a7 3161(h)(1), not the\nends-of-justice continuances that courts may grant under\n\u00a7 3161(h)(7)\u201d (citing Bloate v. United States, 559 U.S. 196, 214\n(2010) (\u201cSubsection (h)(7) provides [m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexi-\nbility \u2026 and gives district courts discretion\u2014within limits\nand subject to specific procedures\u2014to accommodate limited\ndelays for case-specific needs \u2026.\u201d (internal citations and quo-\ntation marks omitted) (first alteration in original)))).\n   In sum, Lloyd has not demonstrated that the district court\nabused its discretion when it found that the facts and circum-\nstances leading to dismissal weighed in favor of dismissal\nwithout prejudice.\n       3. The Impact of a Reprosecution on the Administration of\n          the Act and on the Administration of Justice\n    Finally, the third factor, the impact of a reprosecution on\nthe administration of the Act and the administration of justice,\nrequires courts to consider the repercussions of dismissing\nthe case. Recognizing the flexibility inherent in this third fac-\ntor, a court\u2019s analysis should account for any prejudice to the\ndefendant as well as whether dismissal with prejudice is nec-\nessary to discourage repeated violations of the Act. See Taylor,\n487 U.S. at 340\u221242 (considering \u201cprejudice to the defendant\u201d\nas well as whether dismissal with prejudice is \u201cappropriate in\norder to vindicate the guarantees of the Speedy Trial Act\u201d);\nKillingsworth, 507 F.3d at 1091 (holding \u201cthe purpose of the\nAct would not be served by requiring the court to impose the\nmaximum sanction [of dismissal with prejudice] for a\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                     17\n\nminimum violation [of the Act]\u201d (quoting United States v.\nHawthorne, 705 F.2d 258, 261 (7th Cir. 1983)).\n    In considering whether the defendant suffered any preju-\ndice, length of delay is again relevant, because \u201c[t]he longer\nthe delay, the greater the presumptive or actual prejudice to\nthe defendant \u2026.\u201d Taylor, 487 U.S. at 340. Courts should con-\nsider not only prejudice to the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare\nfor trial, but also prejudice resulting from restrictions on his\nliberty. See id. at 340 (noting that \u201c[i]nordinate delay between\npublic charge and trial \u2026 may disrupt [a defendant\u2019s] em-\nployment, drain his financial resources, curtail his associa-\ntions, subject him to public obloquy, and create anxiety in\nhim, his family and his friends\u201d (some alterations in original)\n(quoting Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 537 (1972) (White, J.,\nconcurring))). That said, just because a defendant was de-\ntained pretrial does not mean the charges must be dismissed\nwith prejudice. See Killingsworth, 507 F.3d at 1091 (noting that\nsuch a rule \u201cwould render Congress\u2019s designation of two\ntypes of dismissal largely irrelevant\u201d).\n    In addition to prejudice, courts should assess whether the\n\u201ccircumstances of the case [leading to the delay] would be\n[]likely to recur,\u201d such that dismissing the case with prejudice\nwould have a needed remedial effect of warding off repeated\nviolations of the Act. Carreon, 626 F.2d at 533; see also Fountain,\n840 F.2d at 512 (noting dismissal with prejudice penalizes not\nonly the prosecutor but \u201cthe rest of society\u201d); United States v.\nDilg, 726 F. App\u2019x 368, 372 (6th Cir. 2018) (explaining the \u201ctwo\nmain considerations under this factor\u201d are \u201c[p]rejudice to the\ndefendant\u201d and \u201cthe deterrent effect of a with-prejudice dis-\nmissal on the government\u2019s \u2026 repeated violations of the\nSpeedy Trial Act\u201d). Although \u201cdismissal with prejudice\n\f18                                                     No. 22-1126\n\nalways sends a stronger message [to the government] than\ndismissal without prejudice,\u201d \u201c[t]hat factor alone, by defini-\ntion implicated in almost every Speedy Trial Act case, does\nnot suffice to justify barring reprosecution \u2026 .\u201d Taylor, 487\nU.S. at 342\u201343. Indeed, \u201c[d]ismissal without prejudice is not a\ntoothless sanction \u2026 .\u201d Id. at 342. Dismissing a case with prej-\nudice, purely to \u201csend [a] strong message to the Government\nthat unexcused delays will not be tolerated\u201d is inappropriate\nbecause courts must consider not just \u201c[t]hat factor alone\u201d but\n\u201call the other circumstances present.\u201d Id. at 343.\n    The district court\u2019s oral ruling pertaining to this final fac-\ntor was limited. It stated:\n       The impact of a re-prosecution on the admin-\n       istration of this chapter and on the administra-\n       tion of justice, I just\u2014I don\u2019t even know really\n       how to apply that factor, but I don\u2019t find that a\n       dismissal without prejudice would have a sig-\n       nificant impact that would require me to dis-\n       miss it with prejudice.\n    Of course, \u201ca \u2018barebones\u2019 district court explanation of its\ninherently discretionary \u2026 ruling \u2018amounts to no exercise of\ndiscretion at all,\u2019 a \u2018non-exercise of discretion [that] is itself an\nabuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d United States v. Fowowe, 1 F.4th 522, 527\n(7th Cir. 2021) (second alteration in original) (quoting United\nStates v. Corner, 967 F.3d 662, 666 (7th Cir. 2020)). Viewed in\nisolation, the court\u2019s statement could counsel a different out-\ncome. Cf. United States v. Settles, 43 F.4th 801, 805\u201306 (7th Cir.\n2022) (noting that if the district court\u2019s \u201cflawed [sentencing\ncalculations] \u2026 were all we had, we would seriously consider\na remand,\u201d but finding that other statements by the district\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                    19\n\ncourt \u201creassure[d] us that the court reviewed the case and ul-\ntimate sentence as an integrated whole\u201d).\n    Here, the district court\u2019s colloquy with counsel is informa-\ntive. The court repeatedly asked Lloyd\u2019s attorney, \u201c[W]hat is\nthe actual prejudice in light of the \u2026 several requests to con-\ntinue both before the eval[uation] and [after?]\u201d Defense coun-\nsel responded that \u201c[t]he prejudice is the case is ex-\ntended \u2026 for no reason other than the marshals just not mov-\ning the person. And Mr. Lloyd\u2019s incarcerated; he\u2019s detained.\u201d\nThe court followed up by asking, \u201c[A]nd your position is you\nwould have been ready to go to trial prior to that, and, there-\nfore, you were prejudiced in the ability to get to trial earlier?\u201d\nAt that point, Lloyd\u2019s attorney conceded, \u201c[L]ook, I can\u2019t tell\nyou with complete certainty that the case would have been to\ntrial within that time period.\u201d In fact, the court pointed out\nthat it was not even holding trials during that period due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n    The court also heard the parties\u2019 conflicting arguments re-\ngarding prejudice. Lloyd highlighted the \u201cprejudice of [a]\nperson having to continue having the case held over their\nhead\u201d and being \u201cdetained as a presumptively innocent citi-\nzen.\u201d The government countered that \u201c[t]here were 240 days\nof continuances after [Lloyd] was found competent, \u2026. [so]\nhe can point to no prejudice\u201d from the transportation delay.\nThe discussion and explication of these issues during the mo-\ntion to dismiss hearing indicates that they factored into the\ncourt\u2019s ruling, shortly thereafter, that \u201cdismissal without prej-\nudice would [not] have a significant impact [on the Admin-\nistration of the Act and on the Administration of Justice].\u201d\n  Moreover, the district court considered the primary argu-\nment on this factor that Lloyd now articulates on appeal\u2014that\n\f20                                                   No. 22-1126\n\nthe government should be punished for allegedly systemic\ndelays. Lloyd complains that \u201c[a]llowing the government to\nsimply walk back into the courtroom mere hours later with a\ncomplaint and continue on with the case is not a sanction.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court expressly rejected that argument. See Tay-\nlor, 487 U.S. at 342 (\u201cDismissal without prejudice is not a\ntoothless sanction \u2026.\u201d). In Taylor, the Supreme Court re-\nversed a dismissal with prejudice where \u201cthe District Court\ndid not fully explicate its reasons for dismissing with preju-\ndice\u201d but concluded that the government\u2019s \u201clackadaisical\u201d\nconduct warranted the result. Id. at 337\u201338. Reversing, the\nCourt cautioned, \u201cIf the greater deterrent effect of barring\nreprosecution could alone support a decision to dismiss with\nprejudice, the consideration of the other factors identified in\n\u00a7 3162(a)(2) would be superfluous, and all violations would\nwarrant\u201d dismissal with prejudice. Id. at 342.\n    In the district court, Lloyd\u2019s counsel argued that dismiss-\ning the case without prejudice effectively tells the U.S. Attor-\nney\u2019s Office that it can \u201ctake as long as [it] wants\u201d because the\n\u201c[w]orst thing that\u2019s going to happen is dismissal without\nprejudice.\u201d He drove his point home: \u201c[C]learly, it\u2019s not much\nof a sanction.\u201d The court was sympathetic, recognizing the\npersistent issue of \u201cthe length of time it takes for \u2026 compe-\ntency evaluations to be conducted\u201d and the delay in imple-\nmenting the physical transport of defendants to these evalua-\ntions. It added that the \u201cBureau of Prisons is taking too long\nto conduct these [competency] examinations\u201d but concluded,\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem I can fix.\u201d While the court did not explicitly\nhold that a dismissal with prejudice was unnecessary to the\nadministration of the Act, the court heard Lloyd\u2019s argument\non that point moments before it ruled. Ultimately, the court\nwas not convinced that a deterrent effect of a dismissal with\n\fNo. 22-1126                                                  21\n\nprejudice swayed the balance of the factors, particularly con-\nsidering that the first two factors\u2014the seriousness of the\ncrime and circumstances leading to the violation of the Act\u2014\nweighed in favor of dismissal without prejudice.\n    Based on the court\u2019s discussions with counsel throughout\nthe hearing, it is evident, despite somewhat admitted confu-\nsion, that the court was attentive to the inquiry set forth by\nthe Supreme Court under this factor. Nevertheless, we em-\nphasize that \u201ca district court must carefully consider [the\nthree] factors as applied to the particular case and, whatever\nits decision, clearly articulate their effect in order to permit\nmeaningful appellate review.\u201d Taylor, 487 U.S. at 336. While\nthe Speedy Trial Act \u201cdoes not mandate any particular for-\nmula or order of decisionmaking,\u201d United States v. Wright, 6\nF.3d 811, 816 (D.C. Cir. 1993), a district court must \u201ccarefully\nexpress its decision whether or not to bar reprosecution in\nterms of the guidelines specified by Congress,\u201d Taylor, 487\nU.S. at 343.\n    In this case, the discussions between counsel and the court\nat the motion to dismiss hearing demonstrate the court\u2019s suf-\n\ufb01cient consideration and application of all the factors within\nthe Act. As such, the court did not abuse its discretion when\nit concluded that the third factor did not outweigh the other\ntwo when it came to dismissing the indictment without prej-\nudice.\n\n                    III.   Conclusion\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we   AFFIRM   the decision of the\ndistrict court.\n\f",
