We have consolidated two\nappeals that pose a common question: whether persons who\ncontend that air carriers have violated state law by using bi-\nometric identi\ufb01cation in the workplace must present these\ncontentions to an adjustment board under the Railway Labor\nAct (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151\u201388, which applies to air carriers\nas well as railroads. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7181. The answer is yes if the\ncontentions amount to a \u201cminor dispute\u201d\u2014that is, a dispute\nabout the interpretation or application of a collective bar-\ngaining agreement. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151a, 184; Hawaiian Airlines,\nInc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 252\u201353 (1994). Plainti\ufb00s insist that\na judge should resolve their contentions, while defendants\ncontend that resolution belongs to an adjustment board.\n    The claims in each suit arise under the Biometric Infor-\nmation Privacy Act (BIPA), 740 ILCS 14/5 to 14/25, which Il-\nlinois adopted in 2008. This law applies to all biometric iden-\nti\ufb01ers, which the statute de\ufb01nes to include \ufb01ngerprints. 740\nILCS 14/10. Before obtaining any \ufb01ngerprint, a \u201cprivate enti-\nty\u201d must inform the subject or \u201cthe subject\u2019s legally author-\nized representative\u201d in writing about several things, such as\nthe purpose of collecting the data and how long they will be\nkept, and obtain the consent of the subject or authorized rep-\nresentative. 740 ILCS 14/15(b). The private entity also must\nestablish and make available to the public a protocol for re-\n\fNos. 18-3476 & 19-1785                                       3\n\ntaining and handling biometric data, which must be de-\nstroyed \u201cwhen the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining\nsuch identi\ufb01ers or information has been satis\ufb01ed or within 3\nyears of the individual\u2019s last interaction with the private en-\ntity, whichever occurs \ufb01rst.\u201d 740 ILCS 14/15(a). Sales of bio-\nmetric information are forbidden, 740 ILCS 14/15(c), and\ntransfers are limited, 740 ILCS 14/15(d). Private entities must\nprotect biometric information from disclosure. 740 ILCS\n14/15(e).\n    Both Southwest Airlines and United Airlines maintain\ntimekeeping systems that require workers to clock in and\nout with their \ufb01ngerprints. Plainti\ufb00s contend that the air car-\nriers implemented these systems without their consent,\nfailed to publish protocols, and use third-party vendors to\nimplement the systems, which plainti\ufb00s call a forbidden dis-\nclosure. Southwest and United contend that the plainti\ufb00s\u2019\nunions have consented\u2014either expressly or through the col-\nlective bargaining agreements\u2019 management-rights clauses\u2014\nand that any required notice has been provided to the un-\nions. The air carriers insist that, to the extent these maoers\nare disputed, an adjustment board rather than a judge must\nresolve the di\ufb00erence\u2014and that if state law gives workers\nrights beyond those provided by federal law and collective\nbargaining agreements, it is preempted by the Railway La-\nbor Act.\n   The suits were assigned to di\ufb00erent district judges.\n    Judge Aspen found that the plainti\ufb00s have standing un-\nder Article III but dismissed the suit against Southwest Air-\nlines for improper venue. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3). 2018 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 143369 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 23, 2018). He made clear,\nhowever, that the suit did not belong in state court or some\n\f4                                       Nos. 18-3476 & 19-1785\n\nother federal district court; he held, rather, that it belongs to\nan adjustment board under the Railway Labor Act and that\nany aoempt by Illinois to give workers rights to bypass their\nunion (Transportation Workers Union Local 555) and deal\ndirectly with an air carrier is preempted by federal law. Thus\ndismissal has nothing to do with venue. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71391.\n    Dismissal should have been labeled either as a judgment\non the pleadings, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), or a dismissal for lack\nof subject-maoer jurisdiction, as this circuit\u2019s decisions sug-\ngest. See, e.g., Carlson v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 758 F.3d\n819, 824\u201325 (7th Cir. 2014); Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way\nEmployees v. Norfolk Southern Ry., 745 F.3d 808 (7th Cir. 2014);\nBrown v. Illinois Central R.R., 254 F.3d 654 (7th Cir. 2001). But\nsee, e.g., Oakey v. U.S. Airways Pilots Disability Plan, 723 F.3d\n227 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (need to resolve a dispute under the\nRailway Labor Act\u2019s procedures does not imply lack of sub-\nject-maoer jurisdiction); Emswiler v. CSX Transportation, Inc.,\n691 F.3d 782 (6th Cir. 2012) (same). None of this circuit\u2019s de-\ncisions considers the e\ufb00ect of the Supreme Court\u2019s modern\nunderstanding of the di\ufb00erence between \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and\nother kinds of rules. See Fort Bend County v. Davis, No. 18\u2013\n525 (U.S. June 3, 2019) (discussing the di\ufb00erence); Carlson,\n758 F.3d at 831 (recognizing that this court has yet to consid-\ner how the distinction applies to the Railway Labor Act). It is\nunnecessary to do so here, for either a substantive or a juris-\ndictional label ends the litigation between these parties and\nforecloses its continuation in any other judicial forum.\n   The suit against United Airlines was \ufb01led in state court\nand removed to federal court on two theories: federal-\nquestion jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act plus re-\nmoval jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71453, part of the Class\n\fNos. 18-3476 & 19-1785                                         5\n\nAction Fairness Act (CAFA). Judge Kendall concluded that\nthe subject is in the bailiwick of plainti\ufb00s\u2019 union (Interna-\ntional Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers)\nand an adjustment board; this aspect of her decision reaches\nthe same conclusion as Judge Aspen. But Judge Kendall\nadded that the complaint did not present a case or contro-\nversy, because the class asserted only a bare procedural\nright. This led her to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. 2018\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 127959 (N.D. Ill. July 31, 2018).\n    The class, which wants to litigate in state court, protested,\nobserving that if there is no federal jurisdiction then the suit\nmust be remanded. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71447(c). Judge Kendall\nagreed. United also complained about the initial decision.\nObserving that the jurisdictional question had not been\nraised or briefed by the parties, United maintained that\nplainti\ufb00s have standing because they allege (or at least im-\nply) that biometric data had been transmioed outside United\nand may have reached inappropriate hands. Judge Kendall\nrefused to revisit that subject, however, and entered an order\nreturning the case to state court. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43484\n(N.D. Ill. Mar. 18, 2019).\n    The remand of a suit removed under the Class Action\nFairness Act is appealable with judicial permission, 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a71453(c)(1), and United asked us to accept its appeal. The\nstatute makes appellate authority turn on removal under the\nClass Action Fairness Act, not on whether the appeal pre-\nsents an issue about the interpretation of that statute. This,\nplus the disparate outcomes of the two suits, led us to accept\nthe appeal even on the assumption that the only issues con-\ncern the interaction between Illinois law and the Railway\nLabor Act. (That assumption may be incorrect. We\u2019ll return\n\f6                                       Nos. 18-3476 & 19-1785\n\nto the question how the Class Action Fairness Act applies to\nthe removal of the suit against United.)\n    Subject-maoer jurisdiction is the \ufb01rst issue in any case,\nand as far as we can see the two suits are identical in this re-\nspect. Judge Aspen found that \ufb01ngerprinted workers have\nstanding, but Judge Kendall thought that a violation of the\nstate statute does not cause concrete injury to anyone, so that\nthe workers lack standing. See, e.g., Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136\nS. Ct. 1540 (2016); Groshek v. Time Warner Cable, Inc., 865 F.3d\n884 (7th Cir. 2017); Casillas v. Madison Avenue Associates, Inc.,\nNo. 17-3162 (7th Cir. June 4, 2019). We disagree with Judge\nKendall\u2019s conclusion, for two principal reasons.\n    First, the stakes in both suits include whether the air car-\nriers can use \ufb01ngerprint identi\ufb01cation. If the unions have not\nconsented, or if the carriers have not provided unions with\nrequired information, a court or adjustment board may or-\nder a change in how workers clock in and out. The prospect\nof a material change in workers\u2019 terms and conditions of\nemployment gives these suits a concrete dimension that\nSpokeo, Groshek, and Casillas lacked. Either the discontinua-\ntion of the practice, or the need for the air carriers to agree to\nhigher wages to induce unions to consent, presents more\nthan a bare procedural dispute. See Robertson v. Allied Solu-\ntions, LLC, 902 F.3d 690, 697 (7th Cir. 2018) (\u201cArticle III\u2019s\nstrictures are met not only when a plainti\ufb00 complains of be-\ning deprived of some bene\ufb01t, but also when a plainti\ufb00 com-\nplains that she was deprived of a chance to obtain a bene-\n\ufb01t.\u201d).\n   Second, plainti\ufb00s assert that the air carriers are not fol-\nlowing the statutory data-retention limit and may have used\noutside parties to administer their timekeeping systems. The\n\fNos. 18-3476 & 19-1785                                          7\n\nlonger data are retained, and the more people have access,\nthe greater the risk of disclosure (including by dissatis\ufb01ed\nemployees who misuse their access or by criminals who\nhack into a computer system). This was Judge Aspen\u2019s ra-\ntionale for \ufb01nding standing. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143369 at\n*5\u201310. Some employees devote time and money to safe-\nguards against identity theft. That\u2019s why we held in Remijas\nv. Neiman Marcus Group, LLC, 794 F.3d 688 (7th Cir. 2015),\nthat a suit contending that hackers obtained personal details\npresents a case or controversy, even though the plainti\ufb00s did\nnot contend that their credit ratings had su\ufb00ered. See also,\ne.g., Lewert v. P.F. Chang\u2019s China Bistro, Inc., 819 F.3d 963 (7th\nCir. 2016); Die\ufb00enbach v. Barnes & Noble, Inc., 887 F.3d 826\n(7th Cir. 2018). Because these complaints do not allege that\nbiometric data are in the hands of malefactors, their position\nis weaker than that of the plainti\ufb00s in Remijas and its succes-\nsors. We need not decide whether the risk of disclosure itself\nsu\ufb03ces for standing\u2014or whether it would be necessary to\ntake discovery into the question whether biometric data\nhave been released\u2014because the \ufb01rst ground of standing is\nindependently su\ufb03cient.\n   We begin with the suit against Southwest, for in that suit\nthe plainti\ufb00s are content to litigate in federal court. We post-\npone the question whether the suit against United was\nproperly removed.\n    A dispute about the interpretation or administration of a\ncollective bargaining agreement must be resolved by an ad-\njustment board under the Railway Labor Act. There is no\ndoubt that Southwest has a collective bargaining agreement\nwith the union that represents the three plainti\ufb00s. Southwest\nasserts that the union assented to the use of \ufb01ngerprints, ei-\n\f8                                      Nos. 18-3476 & 19-1785\n\nther expressly on being noti\ufb01ed before the practice was insti-\ntuted or through a management-rights clause. And there can\nbe no doubt that how workers clock in and out is a proper\nsubject of negotiation between unions and employers\u2014is,\nindeed, a mandatory subject of bargaining. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7152\nFirst. (That phrase usually is associated with negotiations\nunder the National Labor Relations Act, but the Supreme\nCourt has held that the principle applies under the Railway\nLabor Act too, with provisos that do not a\ufb00ect this case. See\nPiTsburgh & Lake Erie R.R. v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Associa-\ntion, 491 U.S. 490, 508 n.17 (1989); Norfolk & Western Ry. v.\nAmerican Train Dispatchers\u2019 Association, 499 U.S. 117, 122\n(1991). See also Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Union\nPaci\ufb01c R.R., 879 F.3d 754, 756 (7th Cir. 2017).)\n    As a maoer of federal law, unions in the air transporta-\ntion business are the workers\u2019 exclusive bargaining agents.\n45 U.S.C. \u00a7152 Second; International Association of Machinists\nv. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 760 (1961). A state cannot remove a\ntopic from the union\u2019s purview and require direct bargain-\ning between individual workers and management. And Illi-\nnois did not try. Its statute provides that a worker or an au-\nthorized agent may receive necessary notices and consent to\nthe collection of biometric information. 740 ILCS 14/15(b).\nWe reject plainti\ufb00s\u2019 contention that a union is not a \u201clegally\nauthorized representative\u201d for this purpose. Neither the\nstatutory text nor any decision by a state court suggests that\nIllinois wants to exclude a collective-bargaining representa-\ntive from the category of authorized agents.\n   Whether Southwest\u2019s or United\u2019s unions did consent to\nthe collection and use of biometric data, or perhaps grant au-\nthority through a management-rights clause, is a question\n\fNos. 18-3476 & 19-1785                                        9\n\nfor an adjustment board. Similarly, the retention and de-\nstruction schedules for biometric data, and whether air car-\nriers may use third parties to implement timekeeping and\nidenti\ufb01cation systems, are topics for bargaining between un-\nions and management. States cannot bypass the mechanisms\nof the Railway Labor Act and authorize direct negotiation or\nlitigation between workers and management. (Whether there\nwould be a role for litigation if a union violated its duty of\nfair representation is a subject we need not confront; plain-\nti\ufb00s have not named a union as a defendant or contended\nthat a union has violated its duty of fair representation.) That\nbiometric information concerns workers\u2019 privacy does not\ndistinguish it from many other subjects, such as drug testing,\nthat are routinely covered by collective bargaining and on\nwhich unions give consent on behalf of the whole bargaining\nunit.\n    When a subject independent of collective bargaining aris-\nes, and concerns di\ufb00erent treatment of di\ufb00erent workers, lit-\nigation may proceed outside the scope of the Railway Labor\nAct. The Supreme Court held in Lingle v. Norge Division of\nMagic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S. 399 (1988) (discussing the Labor\nManagement Relations Act), that a retaliatory-discharge\nclaim may be pursued under state law. Such a claim can be\nresolved without interpreting a collective bargaining agree-\nment; it is person-speci\ufb01c and does not concern the terms\nand conditions of employment. See also Hughes v. United Air\nLines, Inc., 634 F.3d 391 (7th Cir. 2011) (Lingle\u2019s approach ap-\nplies to the Railway Labor Act as well). But our plainti\ufb00s as-\nsert a right in common with all other employees, dealing\nwith a mandatory subject of collective bargaining. It is not\npossible even in principle to litigate a dispute about how an\nair carrier acquires and uses \ufb01ngerprint information for its\n\f10                                      Nos. 18-3476 & 19-1785\n\nwhole workforce without asking whether the union has con-\nsented on the employees\u2019 collective behalf. That\u2019s why this\ndispute must go to an adjustment board. Lingle, Hawaiian\nAirlines, and Hughes all recognize that, if a dispute necessari-\nly entails the interpretation or administration of a collective\nbargaining agreement, there\u2019s no room for individual em-\nployees to sue under state law\u2014in other words, state law is\npreempted to the extent that a state has tried to overrule the\nunion\u2019s choices on behalf of the workers.\n    Plainti\ufb00s stress that Southwest began using workers\u2019 \ufb01n-\ngerprints in 2006, two years before Illinois enacted its law.\nThis shows that the union cannot have consented to South-\nwest\u2019s practices, plainti\ufb00s conclude. That\u2019s not necessarily\nso. Southwest and the union may have discussed and re-\nsolved this maoer in 2005, or 2006, or 2008, or in the decade\nsince. Perhaps in 2006 Southwest supplied all of the infor-\nmation, and the union gave all of the consents, that the state\nlater required. Perhaps the statute led to a new round of bar-\ngaining. What Southwest told the union, whether it fur-\nnished that information in writing, when these things hap-\npened, and what the union said or did in response, are\nmaoers not in this record. They are properly not in this rec-\nord, as they are topics for resolution by an adjustment board\nrather than a judge. Perhaps a board will conclude that the\nunion did not consent or did not receive essential infor-\nmation before consenting, just as plainti\ufb00s assert. But the\nboard must make that decision and supply any appropriate\nremedy.\n    What we have said about the suit against Southwest ap-\nplies equally to the suit against United\u2014and the conclusion\nthat it is impossible to litigate under the state statute without\n\fNos. 18-3476 & 19-1785                                       11\n\nexamining what the union knew and agreed to also means\nthat United was entitled to remove the suit to federal court\nunder the federal-question jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331,\n1441. Although the class aoempted to frame a complaint re-\nlying entirely on state law, the complaint concerns collective\nbargaining regulated by federal law. That brings into play a\ndoctrine misleadingly called \u201ccomplete preemption,\u201d but\nperhaps beoer labeled as a rule that when federal law com-\npletely occupies a \ufb01eld any claim within that scope rests on\nfederal law, no maoer how a plainti\ufb00 tries to frame the com-\nplaint. See Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vaca-\ntion Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 23\u201324 (1983); Lehmann v. Brown, 230\nF.3d 916, 919\u201320 (7th Cir. 2000); Hughes, 634 F.3d at 393.\n    If we are wrong about how the Railway Labor Act a\ufb00ects\ncollective bargaining over \ufb01ngerprinting in the workplace,\nthen the doctrine of complete preemption would not author-\nize removal of the suit against United. So, just in case, we\nadd that the Class Action Fairness Act probably authorized\nthe removal\u2014probably, but not certainly.\n   A \u201cclass action\u201d as de\ufb01ned in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(d)(1) may\nbe removed from state to federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71453(b).\nSection 1332(d) creates federal jurisdiction if a class suit has\nan amount in controversy exceeding $5 million and at least\none member of the class has a citizenship di\ufb00erent from that\nof the defendants. Given the size of the class (more than\n4,000 workers in Illinois alone use \ufb01ngerprints to clock in\nand out) and the penalties provided by state law, the contro-\nversy exceeds $5 million. 740 ILCS 14/20. United is a Dela-\nware corporation with its principal place of business in Illi-\nnois, so if even one person who works for United in Illinois,\nuses \ufb01ngerprints to clock in and out, and is a citizen of any\n\f12                                      Nos. 18-3476 & 19-1785\n\nstate other than Delaware or Illinois, the requirement of min-\nimal diversity is met. It seems likely to us that at least one\nperson domiciled in southern Wisconsin or northwest Indi-\nana works for United at O\u2019Hare Airport, which is in com-\nmuting distance from both states. But, for reasons that Unit-\ned has not explained, its notice of removal does not assert\nthis. Surely United knows where its workers live, and it may\neven know their domicile (which is not always the state of\nresidence), but it did not put that information in its notice of\nremoval, which is therefore de\ufb01cient.\n    The class representative tells us that he wants the class\nlimited to citizens of Illinois. It is far from clear that this is\nappropriate. The state law applies to private entities that col-\nlect biometric data in Illinois; the statute does not purport to\nexclude people who work in Illinois, provide biometric data\nin Illinois, but are domiciled in other states. Nor is it clear\nthat the class was so limited on the date of removal\u2014and\npost-removal amendments to a complaint or other papers do\nnot eliminate jurisdiction proper at the time of removal. See\nRockwell International Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473\u2013\n74 & n.6 (2007). Still, the shortcoming in United\u2019s allegations\nof citizenship remains as a potential obstacle.\n   After these problems were pointed out at oral argument,\nUnited \ufb01led a jurisdictional supplement, invoking 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a71653. In addition to wrongly supposing that the suit chal-\nlenges its employment practices nationwide\u2014which is not\npossible, as the state statute is limited to Illinois\u2014the sup-\nplemental \ufb01ling continues to refer to the \u201cresidence\u201d rather\nthan the \u201ccitizenship\u201d of United\u2019s Illinois workforce.\n    Given our conclusion that the federal-question jurisdic-\ntion supports removal, we need not remand for the district\n\fNos. 18-3476 & 19-1785                                      13\n\ncourt to explore the question whether, on the date the case\nwas removed, one class member was a citizen of Wisconsin\nor Indiana, or conceivably some third state other than Illinois\nor Delaware\u2014say, a citizen of California temporarily de-\ntailed to work at O\u2019Hare.\n      In Miller v. Southwest Airlines, No. 18-3476, the judg-\nment of the district court is a\ufb03rmed. In Johnson v. United Air-\nlines, No. 19-1785, the judgment is vacated, and the case is\nremanded with instructions to refer the parties\u2019 dispute to an\nadjustment board.\n\f",
