Sampay was found guilty of a second-degree felony and sentenced to ten\r\nyears' imprisonment pursuant to a plea bargaining agreement.  Sampay was indigent at trial and\r\nrepresented by appointed counsel.  As part of the plea bargaining agreement, he waived his right to\r\nhave a court reporter present. \r\n\r\n\tThere is also a stamped notation on the judgment itself that reads \"Appeal waived.  No\r\npermission to appeal granted.\"  This notation is explicitly supported by the plea bargaining\r\nagreement itself, in which Sampay signed a statement that if the plea bargain was kept, he agreed to\r\nwaive his right of appeal.  That waiver is signed by Sampay, his attorney, the district clerk, the\r\nassistant district attorney, and the presiding judge.  The record reflects he was sentenced in\r\naccordance with the plea bargaining agreement.\r\n\r\n\tA criminal defendant may waive many rights, including the right to appeal a conviction. \r\nBlanco v. State, 18 S.W.3d 218, 219-20 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).  That waiver is binding on the\r\ndefendant and prevents him from appealing any issue in the case without the consent of the court. \r\nId.  Sampay agreed, with the concurrence of counsel, to plead guilty and to waive his right to appeal. \r\nWe will hold him to his agreement.  See id. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe appeal is dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBen Z.

See Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 46.10 (Vernon 2003).  After a\r\nshort trial and fifteen minutes of deliberation, the jury found Browner guilty as charged in\r\nthe indictment.  The trial court subsequently sentenced Browner to fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment, in accordance with the jury's punishment recommendation.  Browner timely\r\nappealed the trial court's judgment.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February 24, 2005, Browner's appellate counsel filed an Anders\r\n\r\n\r\n brief in which\r\ncounsel professionally discussed the record, described the issues reviewed, and concluded\r\nthere were no arguable grounds for appeal and, as required by Anders, also filed a motion\r\nto withdraw.  Counsel also sent Browner a copy of the appellate brief and informed\r\nBrowner of his right to review the record and to file a response pro se.  Counsel also took\r\nthe commendable step of sending Browner a complete copy of the appellate record in this\r\ncase.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We informed Browner on March 1, 2005, that his response, if any, was due to be\r\nfiled by March 31, 2005.  As of this date, we have not received a responsive pro se brief. \r\nNor has the State filed an independent evaluation of the case.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\r\nAnn. art.\u00a02.01 (Vernon 2005).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have independently reviewed the record and the brief filed by counsel in this\r\nappeal, and we agree there are no arguable issues that would support an appeal in this\r\ncase.  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\r\nI.  Factual and Legal Sufficiency To Support a Finding of Guilt on the Lesser Offense\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We first note that the evidence is sufficient to support Browner's conviction for\r\npossession of a deadly weapon in a penal institution.  In reviewing the legal sufficiency of\r\nthe evidence, we view the relevant evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and\r\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\r\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.  Johnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2000).  In a factual sufficiency review, we view all the evidence in a neutral light and\r\ndetermine whether the jury was rationally justified in finding guilt beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.  Zuniga v. State, 144 S.W.3d 477, 484 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As defined by statute, the elements of the alleged offense are (1) intentionally,\r\nknowingly, or recklessly; (2) carrying about one's person or possessing or concealing; (3)\u00a0a\r\ndeadly weapon; (4) in a penal institution.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 46.10(a).  Our law defines\r\nthe term \"deadly weapon\" as \"anything that in the manner of its use or intended use is\r\ncapable of causing death or serious bodily injury.\"  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(B)\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2004\u20132005).  This offense is a third degree felony. \u00a0Tex. Pen. Code Ann.\r\n\u00a7 46.10(d). \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lieutenant Steven Fahrquar,\r\n\r\n\r\n a seven-year employee of the TDCJ, testified in this\r\ncase.  On September 15, 2002, Fahrquar had been assigned to supervise the showering\r\nof inmates.  According to Fahrquar's testimony, inmates who are classified as T-5\r\noffenders must be strip searched before being allowed to shower.  On this date, Fahrquar\r\nasked Browner if he wanted to take a shower, and Browner said, \"Yes.\"  Fahrquar then\r\ninstructed Browner to remove his clothing and give it to Fahrquar for inspection.  Browner\r\ncomplied, except he did not remove his underwear.  When Fahrquar asked Browner to\r\nremove his underwear, Fahrquar saw Browner remove what Fahrquar described as a\r\n\"homemade stabbing device.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Browner placed the item on the table in his cell.  Fahrquar\r\ninstructed Browner to step to the door, place his hands through the food service slot to\r\nallow Fahrquar to apply the handcuffs, and Browner complied.  Once Browner and his cell\r\nhad been secured, Fahrquar entered the cell and seized the device, which was then\r\nadmitted at trial.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ronald Stafford also testified for the State.  Stafford works for the office of the\r\nInspector General, which is part of the TDCJ.  Stafford was assigned to the Telford Unit\r\non September 16, 2002, and retrieved the weapon in question from Browner's cell. \r\nStafford testified that the \"shank\" found in Browner's cell was a deadly weapon because\r\n\"by its design it could be used to cause serious bodily injury or actually kill someone.\" \r\nStafford also told the jury that, during his career with the TDCJ, he has seen someone who\r\nwas killed or seriously injured with a weapon similar to the one at issue in this case.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there is\r\nevidence to support the jury's finding that the prosecution met its burden of proof for each\r\nlegal element of the charged offense.  Browner had possession of a shank, the possession\r\noccurred in his cell at the Telford Unit (a division of the TDCJ), and the weapon in question\r\nwas capable of causing serious bodily injury or death.  We also believe the jury's finding\r\nof guilt is not irrational, against the great weight of the evidence, or manifestly unjust.  See\r\nZuniga, 144 S.W.3d at 482, 484\u201385.  Accordingly, we hold the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually sufficient to support the trial court's judgment of conviction.\r\nII.  Jury Charge on Reasonable Doubt\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the conference on the jury charge for guilt/innocence, Browner requested the trial\r\ncourt to instruct the jury on a definition of \"reasonable doubt,\" using a definition from In re\r\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970).  The trial court denied the requested instruction.  The Texas\r\nCourt of Criminal Appeals has expressly stated that \"the better practice is to give no\r\ndefinition of reasonable doubt at all to the jury.\"  Paulson v. State, 28 S.W.3d 570, 573\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (overruling Geesa v. State, 820 S.W.2d 154 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1991)).  Winship did not mandate that trial courts define the term \"reasonable doubt,\" nor\r\ndoes our jurisprudence require such.  The trial court properly overruled Browner's\r\nrequested jury instruction.\r\nIII.  Punishment\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We next turn to whether any reversible error arose during the punishment trial.  After\r\nfinding that Browner had been previously and finally convicted of a felony offense, the trial\r\ncourt instructed the jury to assess Browner's punishment within the range provided for a\r\nsecond degree felony.  The punishment range for a second degree felony is imprisonment\r\nfor not less than two years nor more than twenty years.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 12.33\r\n(Vernon 2003).  The punishment range for Browner's offense was increased from a third\r\ndegree felony to a second degree felony because Browner pled \"true\" to having been\r\npreviously convicted of a felony offense.  See Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 12.42(a)(3) (Vernon\r\nSupp. 2004\u20132005); Graham v. State, 546 S.W.2d 605, 608 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977) (plea\r\nof \"true\" to enhancement paragraph provides sufficient evidence to support enhanced\r\nsentence).  The evidence is, therefore, sufficient to support Browner being sentenced\r\nwithin the range provided for second degree felonies.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury also heard testimony that prison officials had confiscated documents from\r\nBrowner that possibly linked him to gang activity (specifically the \"Crips\" gang) when he\r\nentered prison.  Evidence of gang activity is admissible during the punishment phase of a\r\ntrial as relevant character evidence.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, \u00a7 3(a)(1)\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2004\u20132005) (evidence of any matter court deems relevant admissible,\r\nincluding accused's character); Stewart v. State, 995 S.W.2d 251 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While being cross-examined about several documents found in Browner's\r\npossession, Frank Warner (a sergeant with the TDCJ at the Telford Unit) and Browner's\r\ncounsel, the following exchange took place before the jury:\r\nQIs that Reginald Browner's art work?\r\n\u00a0\r\nAYes.  It was confiscated from his property.\r\n\u00a0\r\nQDid he draw that?\r\n\u00a0\r\nAI don't know if he drew it or not, sir.

Counsel immediately objected to Warner's testimony as \"a comment\r\non [Browner's] Fifth Amendment right\" to not testify.  The trial court immediately sustained\r\nthe objection and sua sponte instructed the jury to disregard Warner's last statement; the\r\ntrial court further instructed the jury to not assume Browner had any obligation to testify. \r\nThe trial court subsequently overruled Browner's request for a mistrial.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a trial court sustains an objection to a comment on a defendant's failure to\r\ntestify and instructs the jury that it is to disregard the inappropriate comment, but the court\r\nthen refuses to grant a mistrial, the issue on appellate review is whether the trial court\r\nerred by denying the motion for mistrial.  Dotson v. State, 146 S.W.3d 285, 298 (Tex.\r\nApp.\u2014Fort Worth 2004, pet. ref'd).  The resolution of whether the trial court erred hinges\r\n\"on whether the court's instruction to disregard cured the prejudicial effect, if any,\" caused\r\nby the improper comment.  Id.  Generally, an instruction to disregard cures any prejudicial\r\neffect.  Id.  Given the trial court's swift response in this case, its explicit and immediate\r\ninstruction to disregard the witness' improper comment, and the court's subsequent written\r\ninstruction in its jury charge that the jury should not (and could not) hold Browner's failure\r\nto testify against him, we believe the trial court's actions cured the error in Warner's\r\ntestimony.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury in this case assessed punishment at fifteen years, which was within the\r\nrange provided by statute based on Browner's judicial confession of having been previously\r\nconvicted of a felony offense.  The evidence of Browner's possible gang affiliation was\r\nproperly admitted.  And the trial court cured any prejudicial effect of Warner's improper\r\ncomment on Browner's failure to testify by issuing a prompt instruction to the jury to\r\ndisregard.  Nothing else in the record before us suggests an arguable error occurred during\r\nthe punishment trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.
