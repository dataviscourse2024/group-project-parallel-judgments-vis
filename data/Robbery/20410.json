Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004).\u00a0 We affirm.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Davis testified that D.T., a\r\njuvenile, initially denied involvement in the burglary, but eventually admitted\r\nacting as a lookout.\u00a0 D.T. waited at the rear of the home and was to alert\r\nCarroll with a \u201cyelping noise\u201d if he saw police or anyone else around who might\r\nstop the burglary.\u00a0 D.T. stated that Carroll slid the back door open, moved\r\nsome items from the back of the house, and carried the items to the street.\u00a0\r\nOne item was a flat screen television.\u00a0 D.T. was to receive $25 for acting as\r\nthe lookout.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A statement against interest\r\nis defined as:\u00a0 \r\n\r\nA statement which was at the time of its\r\nmaking so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or\r\nso far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to\r\nrender invalid a claim by the declarant against another, or to make the\r\ndeclarant an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace, that a reasonable person\r\nin declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it\r\nto be true. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTex. R. Evid. 803(24). \u00a0These statements fall\r\ninto three categories: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSome inculpate only the declarant (e.g.,\r\n\u201cI killed Joe.\u201d); others inculpate equally both the declarant and a third\r\nparty, such as a co-defendant (e.g., \u201cWe killed Joe.\u201d); still others\r\ninculpate both the declarant and third party, but also shift blame by\r\nminimizing the speaker\u2019s culpability (e.g., \u201cWe robbed the bank, and Dan\r\nkilled Joe, the bank teller.\u201d).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWalter v. State, 267 S.W.3d 883, 891\u00a0(Tex. Crim. App. 2008).\u00a0 Both statements\r\nthat are directly against the declarant\u2019s interest and collateral\r\n\u201cblame-sharing\u201d statements may be admissible under Rule 803(24), if\r\ncorroborating circumstances clearly indicate their trustworthiness.\u00a0 Id. at 896.\u00a0 \u201cBlame-shifting\u201d statements that minimize the speaker\u2019s culpability are\r\nnot, absent extraordinary circumstances, admissible under the rule.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn Walter, the co-defendant told a\r\nwitness that Walter and he went to the Outback Steakhouse in Texarkana and that\r\nhe stood in the hallway while Walter went inside the restaurant office, took\r\nmoney, and shot three employees.\u00a0 See Walter, 267 S.W.3d at 887-88.\u00a0\r\nThis statement minimized the co-defendant\u2019s culpability by shifting the blame\r\nto Walter for the murders.\u00a0 Id. at 899-900.\u00a0 D.T.\u2019s statement indicated\r\nthat both he and Carroll were equally responsible for the burglary.\u00a0 See\r\nRollerson v. State, 227 S.W.3d 718, 726 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (\u201cEven if appellant was only a\r\n\u2018lookout\u2019 (or one of several burglars) he is still guilty of the offense of burglary.\u201d); Bingham v. State, 987 S.W.2d 54, 55, 57 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1999) (Officer\u2019s testimony that wife admitted that \u201cshe and her husband\r\nhad planned the fire and that [he] actually lit the match which started the\r\nfire\u201d was properly admitted as a statement against interest).\r\n\r\nD.T.\u2019s statement is also supported by\r\ncorroborating circumstances.\u00a0 On the day of the offense, witnesses saw Carroll\r\nand D.T. walk toward the victim\u2019s house and go behind the house.\u00a0 D.T. later returned\r\nfrom around the house and entered a vehicle driven by a third man.\u00a0 One witness\r\nfollowed the vehicle to Alice Street and saw Carroll come out of the bushes and\r\nenter the vehicle.\u00a0 Officer Kristen Johnson identified the sliding door at the\r\nback of the victim\u2019s home as the point of entry.\u00a0 She also noticed that part of\r\nthe fence in the back yard was broken down and a trail left behind, which led\r\nto an abandoned house on Alice Street. \u00a0The victim testified that a flat screen\r\ntelevision was taken from his house.\u00a0 A witness saw Carroll in possession of a\r\nflat screen television shortly after the burglary.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nMoreover, D.T. was present, available to\r\ntestify, granted use immunity, and represented by counsel.\u00a0 Crawford is inapplicable where the\r\ndeclarant is available\r\nto testify at trial. \u00a0Gravens\r\nv.
