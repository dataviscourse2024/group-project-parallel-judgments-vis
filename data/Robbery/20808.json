This insurance-coverage dispute\narises from a fraudulent scheme perpetrated against First\nState Bank of Monticello causing a $307,000 loss. James\nStilwell repeatedly exchanged bad checks for the bank\u2019s\n\f2                                  Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\nmoney orders\u2014instruments backed by the resources of the\nbank and as good as cash. The bank filed a claim for the\nloss with its insurer, Ohio Casualty Insurance Company,\nunder a Standard Form No. 24 Financial Institution\nBond. Ohio Casualty denied the claim and this lawsuit\nfollowed. The district court held the loss was covered\nand granted summary judgment in favor of First State\nBank. Ohio Casualty appealed; the bank cross-appealed\non the issue of its entitlement to prejudgment interest.\n  We affirm. Stilwell\u2019s scheme was a covered risk under\nInsuring Agreement B of the bond, which covers losses\nfrom theft or false pretenses occurring on the bank\u2019s\npremises. The bank\u2019s loss resulted \u201cdirectly from\u201d\nStilwell\u2019s \u201con-premises\u201d fraud and therefore came within\nthe coverage specified in this provision of the bond. We\nalso conclude that Exclusion (h), excluding losses \u201ccaused\nby an employee,\u201d does not apply. Finally, the bank\u2019s tardy\napplication for statutory prejudgment interest, first made\nin the district court in a motion to alter or amend the\njudgment under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, was brought too late to entitle it to an award.\n\n\n                     I. Background\n  For several months in 2002 and 2003, James Stilwell of\nAtwood, Illinois, carried on an extensive scheme of writing\nand cashing worthless checks. First State Bank in nearby\nMonticello was his victim. Stilwell was a prominent\nentrepreneur who owned several businesses and some\ndevelopment property in central Illinois, but he was also\n\fNos. 06-3685 & 06-3794                                       3\n\nilliquid.1 To acquire cash, Stilwell devised a scheme\nwhereby he (or more commonly, one of his associates)\nwould draw checks on one of his accounts at Tuscola\nNational Bank and tender them to First State Bank in\nreturn for bank money orders, instruments backed by the\nresources of First State Bank. But Stilwell\u2019s account at\nTuscola National Bank was empty, or less than empty;\nTuscola National Bank allowed him to maintain\nnegative balances for months at a time, returning some\nitems and paying others that Stilwell directed to be paid\nwhen he put funds into the account after the fact. So\nFirst State Bank unwittingly allowed Stilwell to exchange\nhis worthless checks for the bank\u2019s money orders, giving\nhim access to immediately available funds. Stilwell\ncarried out this scheme for three months at the end of\n2002 and into early 2003, tendering checks daily to First\nState Bank through January 24, 2003. Over that time\nFirst State Bank \u201csold\u201d Stilwell 130 bank money orders\nfor a total of $1,945,672.16.\n  Cashing checks for noncustomers was against the\nbank\u2019s policy (Stilwell had no accounts at First State\nBank), but when bank officers questioned Stilwell about\nthe transactions, he concocted a cover story that he was\nconducting a year-end tax maneuver recommended by\nhis accountant to reduce his tax liability on a future sale\nof land. On one occasion, to quell the doubts of a bank\n\n\n\n1\n  James Stilwell\u2019s financial activities are at issue in another\ninsurance-law case decided today. See Stilwell v. Am. Gen. Life\nIns. Co., Nos. 07-2613 & 07-2684.\n\f4                                    Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\nofficer, Stilwell dialed Tuscola National Bank\u2019s automated\nbanking system and handed the officer the phone,\nallowing her to listen to a statement of the current\nbalance in his\u2014or what he claimed was his\u2014account. So\nwhile some at First State Bank expressed concerns, others\nbelieved him, and the bank continued to accept his busi-\nness based on his facade of being a successful business-\nman. The scheme collapsed on January 24, 2003, when\nTuscola National Bank froze Stilwell\u2019s accounts. First\nState Bank was left holding worthless checks totaling\n$307,000 from the last three days of the scheme.\n  First State Bank and Stilwell entered into an agreement\nrequiring Stilwell to repay the bank in a series of install-\nments and to admit that he had engaged in unlawful\nconduct. But Stilwell died before fulfilling the terms of that\nagreement. First State Bank filed a claim with its insurer,\nOhio Casualty, after one of Stilwell\u2019s corporations filed for\nbankruptcy, preventing the bank from recovering its loss\nfrom the corporation. Ohio Casualty denied the bank\u2019s\nclaim, asserting that Stilwell\u2019s scheme was not covered\nunder the bond\u2019s \u201con-premises\u201d fraud coverage (Insuring\nAgreement B of the Standard Form No. 24 Financial\nInstitution Bond) or was excluded because it fell under\nExclusion (h) of the bond, which excluded losses \u201ccaused\nby an employee.\u201d\n  First State Bank then brought this lawsuit in state court,\nwhich Ohio Casualty removed to federal court based on\nthe parties\u2019 diverse citizenship. On cross-motions for\nsummary judgment, Ohio Casualty asserted several\ngrounds for noncoverage. It claimed that the bank did not\n\fNos. 06-3685 & 06-3794                                      5\n\nsuffer a \u201closs\u201d as that term is understood in the bond; or if\nthere was a loss, it did not \u201cresult directly from\u201d Stilwell\u2019s\nconduct; or if the loss was attributable to Stilwell\u2019s scheme,\nthe failure of the bank\u2019s employees to follow bank policy\nwas an intervening and the predominant cause of the loss,\nremoving coverage under Exclusion (h) of the bond for\nlosses \u201ccaused by an employee.\u201d The district court rejected\nthese arguments, granted First State Bank\u2019s motion, and\nawarded judgment to the bank. First State Bank then\nmoved to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e),\nasking the court to clarify the amount of the award and to\nadd statutory prejudgment interest. The district court\nagreed to clarify the award amount in the judgment\n($292,000\u2014the amount of the loss less the deductible), but\ndenied First State Bank\u2019s request to add prejudgment\ninterest to the award. Ohio Casualty appealed the sum-\nmary judgment, and First State Bank cross-appealed the\ndenial of its Rule 59(e) motion for prejudgment interest.\n\n\n                      II. Discussion\n  We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judg-\nment de novo, and because the district court had cross-\nmotions for summary judgment before it, \u201cwe construe\nall facts and inferences therefrom \u2018in favor of the party\nagainst whom the motion under consideration is\nmade.\u2019 \u201d United Air Lines, Inc. v. HSBC Bank, USA (In re\nUnited Air Lines, Inc.), 453 F.3d 463, 468 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Kort v. Diversified Collection Servs., Inc., 394\nF.3d 530, 536 (7th Cir. 2004)). Summary judgment is\nappropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material\n\f6                                      Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\nfact and . . . the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.\u201d FED. R. C IV. P. 56(c). Illinois law, the parties agree,\ngoverns this case.\n  We review the interpretation of a fidelity bond de\nnovo. Private Bank & Trust Co. v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co.,\n409 F.3d 814, 816 (7th Cir. 2005) (Illinois law). A bond \u201cthat\ncontains no ambiguity is to be construed according to\nthe plain and ordinary meaning of its terms, just as\nwould any other contract.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also RBC Mortgage Co. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins.\nCo., 812 N.E.2d 728, 734 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004). Standard\nfidelity bonds are drafted by sophisticated parties (repre-\nsentatives of the banking and insurance industries);\ntherefore, the traditional rule of construing any am-\nbiguity in favor of coverage does not apply. First Nat\u2019l\nBank of Manitowoc v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 485 F.3d 971, 977\n(7th Cir. 2007); RBC Mortgage Co., 812 N.E.2d at 734. The\nbond that Ohio Casualty sold to First State Bank was a\nstandard financial-institution bond that contained an\n\u201con-premises\u201d clause generally covering fraudulent acts\noccurring on the bank\u2019s physical premises.\n   The standard financial-institution bond is a unique\ninsurance instrument with a long and detailed history.\nSome of it bears repeating here because part of what\nmakes the bond unique is that nearly every provision\n\u201chas been developed in response to and tested by case\nlaw.\u201d J. Kelly Reyher, A Brief Review of the Financial Institu-\ntion Bond Standard Form No. 24 and Commercial Crime\nPolicy, 563 PLI/Lit 57, PLI Order No. H4-5259, 61 (May\n1997). The Standard Form No. 24 Financial Institution\n\fNos. 06-3685 & 06-3794                                           7\n\nBond is the latest incarnation of a series of bonds once\nknown as \u201cbanker\u2019s blanket bonds.\u201d First Nat\u2019l Bank of\nManitowoc, 485 F.3d at 977-78; see also 9A JOHN A LAN\nA PPELMAN & JEAN A PPELMAN, INSURANCE L AW AND P RAC-\nTICE \u00a7 5701, at 375-76 (1981); Peter I. Broeman, An Overview\nof the Financial Institution Bond, Standard Form No. 24, 110\nB ANKING L.J. 439, 442-43 (1993). These bonds were\nfirst developed in response to the uniform contract mar-\nketed by Lloyd\u2019s of London, which was the only contract\nto provide fidelity, theft, burglary, holdup, and other\ntypes of coverage in one contract. See Private Bank, 409\nF.3d at 816. The Surety Association of America and the\nAmerican Bankers Association worked together in 1916\nto draft their first bond, the Standard Form No. 1 Banker\u2019s\nBlanket Bond, to compete with the uniform contract\noffered by Lloyd\u2019s. Id.; see also Edward G. Gallagher et al.,\nA Brief History of the Financial Institution Bond, in F INANCIAL\nINSTITUTION B ONDS 7 (2d ed. Duncan L. Clore ed., 1998).\nToday, Standard Form No. 24 is the descendant of that\nfirst bond, containing six Insuring Agreements (Agree-\nments A-F). In this case, we are concerned with Insuring\nAgreement B of the Standard Form No. 24 (1986 Revision)\nthat Ohio Casualty sold to First State Bank.2 Agreement B\nis the \u201con-premises\u201d fraud clause of the bond. Its relevant\nportion provides as follows:\n\n\n2\n   Because the standard bond is sometimes modified by the\nparties and various iterations of it are in use, it is important to\ndetermine which version of the bond is under consideration.\nCaselaw interpreting other versions may be unhelpful or\nirrelevant to a court\u2019s interpretation of the bond. See First Nat\u2019l\nBank of Manitowoc, 485 F.3d at 977.\n\f8                                       Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\n      The Underwriter . . . agrees to indemnify the Insured\n    for:\n         (B)(1) Loss of Property resulting directly from . . .\n             (b) theft, false pretenses, common-law or\n             statutory larceny, committed by a person\n             present in an office or on the premises of the\n             Insured while the property is lodged or depos-\n             ited within offices or premises located any-\n             where.\nOhio Casualty does not dispute that Stilwell\u2019s fraudulent\nconduct (or that of his associates) was committed on the\nbank\u2019s premises. It argues that First State Bank did not\nincur a \u201closs . . . resulting directly from . . . false pretenses.\u201d\n  The first part of Ohio Casualty\u2019s argument is that First\nState Bank did not, in fact, suffer a loss because it received\na valid and enforceable instrument\u2014namely, Stilwell\u2019s\ncheck drawn on his (empty) account at Tuscola National\nBank\u2014in exchange for its money order. If First State\nBank incurred any loss, Ohio Casualty argues that it would\nhave occurred later when First State Bank was unable to\ncollect on Stilwell\u2019s check. That, Ohio Casualty asserts,\nwould not have been a covered loss because that event\nwould neither have taken place on First State Bank\u2019s\npremises nor \u201cresulted directly from\u201d any false pretenses.\n   Under Illinois law, and in most jurisdictions, a loss is\nan \u201cactual depletion of bank funds\u201d; bookkeeping or\ntheoretical losses are not covered by the financial-institu-\ntion bond. RBC Mortgage Co., 812 N.E.2d at 733; see also\nReserve Ins. Co. v. Gen. Ins. Co. of Am., 395 N.E.2d 933, 939\n(Ill. App. Ct. 1979); Private Bank, 409 F.3d at 817 (Illinois\n\fNos. 06-3685 & 06-3794                                       9\n\nlaw); Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Star Fin. Bank, 35 F.3d 1186, 1191\n(7th Cir. 1994) (Indiana law) (requiring an actual loss\ninstead of merely a bookkeeping or theoretical loss); FDIC\nv. United Pac. Ins. Co., 20 F.3d 1070, 1080 (10th Cir. 1994)\n(federal law) (the bond does not cover \u201c[b]ookkeeping or\ntheoretical losses, not accompanied by actual withdrawals\nof cash or other such pecuniary loss\u201d); William T. Bogaert\n& Andrew F. Caplan, Loss and Causation Under the Financial\nInstitution Bond, in F INANCIAL INSTITUTION B ONDS, supra,\nat 385-87. First State Bank\u2019s loss was such an \u201cactual loss.\u201d\n  It is true that First State Bank did not experience a loss\nat the precise moment Stilwell exchanged his checks for\nthe bank\u2019s money orders; although his account was\nempty, it was not certain that the checks would be\nreturned unpaid, as evidenced by the fact that Tuscola\nNational Bank had paid some of Stilwell\u2019s earlier checks\ndespite the negative balance in his account. At the\nmoment of the exchange, any loss from acquiring Stilwell\u2019s\nchecks was merely theoretical. But First State Bank experi-\nenced an actual loss when Tuscola National Bank refused\nto honor Stilwell\u2019s checks. Once it did so, First State Bank\nnecessarily had fewer available assets. That the act of\nnonpayment occurred \u201coff premises\u201d is of no moment.\nInsuring Agreement B requires only that the false pretenses\nbe committed by a person on First State Bank\u2019s premises,\nand that\u2019s exactly what happened here. (We will defer\nfor a moment the question of whether the bank\u2019s loss\nresulted \u201cdirectly from\u201d Stilwell\u2019s on-premises fraud.)\n  Ohio Casualty also makes a weak argument that\nStilwell\u2019s conduct did not amount to false pretenses.\n\f10                                   Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\nIllinois law considers the term \u201cfalse pretenses\u201d in the\nfinancial-institution bond to include, at the least, deceptive\npractices under the Illinois criminal statutes. First Nat\u2019l\nBank of Decatur v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 424 F.2d 312, 317 (7th\nCir. 1970) (citing what is now 720 ILL. C OMP. S TAT. 5/17-1\n(2006)). Section 5/17-1(B)(d) of the Illinois Statutes makes\nit a crime for an individual to \u201cissue[] or deliver[] a\ncheck . . . knowing that it will not be paid by the deposi-\ntory. Failure to have sufficient funds . . . is prima facie\nevidence that the offender knows that it will not be paid\nby the depository, and that he or she has the intent to\ndefraud.\u201d As we have noted, Stilwell knew that he did\nnot have any funds at Tuscola National Bank on the\ndates in question. All along, he concocted and main-\ntained an elaborate cover story to effectuate his scheme,\nand there is no evidence in the record to overcome the\nstatutory presumption that Stilwell intended to defraud.\nThat he occasionally put money in his account at Tuscola\nNational Bank to cover some of his earlier bad checks\nafter the fact does not negate his intent to defraud. His\nwillingness to sign an installment repayment agreement\nafter his deception was uncovered is irrelevant.\n  We now return to Ohio Casualty\u2019s argument that First\nState Bank\u2019s loss did not result \u201cdirectly from\u201d Stilwell\u2019s\nfalse pretenses. This language in the financial-institution\nbond has undergone a series of revisions. Earlier\nversions of the bond required merely a \u201closs through\u201d a\ncovered event or transaction. Bradford R. Carver, Loss\nand Causation, in H ANDLING F IDELITY B OND C LAIMS 363, 379\n(2d ed. Michael Keeley & Sean Duffy eds., 2005). The 1986\nversion of the bond specifically modified the bond to\n\fNos. 06-3685 & 06-3794                                           11\n\nrequire, in the case of some coverages, a loss \u201cresulting\ndirectly from\u201d the covered peril. This was a response to\ncertain court interpretations that applied tort concepts\nof causation to the bond\u2019s loss-causation requirements. Id.\n  Indeed, loss causation has been a sometimes-misunder-\nstood concept in the caselaw interpreting financial-institu-\ntion bonds. Even after the 1986 revision, some courts\nhave continued to look to proximate cause and other causa-\ntion principles borrowed from tort law to decide loss-\ncausation issues under the financial-institution bond. See,\ne.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v. Fid. & Deposit Co. of Md., 205\nF.3d 615, 655 (3d Cir. 2000); Empire Bank v. Fid. & Deposit\nCo., 828 F. Supp. 675, 679, aff\u2019d 27 F.3d 333 (8th Cir. 1994);\nJefferson Bank v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 965 F.2d 1274,\n1282 (3d Cir. 1992); First Nat\u2019l Bank of Louisville v. Lustig,\n961 F.2d 1162, 1167-68 (5th Cir. 1992), amended by, No. 90-\n3820, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 14873 (5th Cir. June 29, 1992);\nHanson PLC v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa.,\n794 P.2d 66, 73 (Wash. Ct. App. 1990). This approach is\nmisdirected; tort-causation concepts like proximate\ncause, \u201csubstantial factor\u201d causation, and intervening\ncause are inappropriate here. In particular, the concept of\nproximate cause is problematic in this context; proximate\ncause is a shifting standard that draws the line of causa-\ntion \u201cbecause of convenience, of public policy, of a rough\nsense of justice . . . . It is practical politics.\u201d Palsgraf v. Long\nIsland R.R., 162 N.E. 99, 103 (N.Y. 1928) (Andrews, J.,\ndissenting). Insurance-coverage cases are not concerned\nwith the philosophical social-duty underpinnings of tort\nlaw. The action sounds in contract, and our task is to\n\f12                                   Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\ninterpret the parties\u2019 agreement. Justice (then Judge)\nCardozo explained the inapplicability of tort-causation\nprinciples in this context nearly a century ago:\n     General definitions of a proximate cause give little aid.\n     Our guide is the reasonable expectation and purpose\n     of the ordinary business man when making an ordi-\n     nary business contract. It is his intention, expressed or\n     fairly to be inferred, that counts. There are times when\n     the law permits us to go far back in tracing events to\n     causes. The inquiry for us is how far the parties to\n     this contract intended us to go. . . .\n     The question is not what men ought to think of as a\n     cause. The question is what they do think of as a cause.\nBird v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 120 N.E. 86, 87 (N.Y.\n1918).\n   Accordingly, contract\u2014not tort\u2014principles apply to the\ndetermination of loss causation; Illinois follows this rule.\nSee RBC Mortgage Co., 812 N.E.2d at 733-36 (rejecting\nproximate-cause analysis of loss causation in financial-\ninstitution bond context); Spearman Indus., Inc. v. St. Paul\nFire & Marine Ins. Co., 138 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1100-01 (N.D.\nIll. 2001) (Illinois law); see also Bradford R. Carver, Loss\nand Causation, supra, at 380; Maura Z. Pelleteri, Causation in\nLoan Loss Cases, in L OAN L OSS C OVERAGE U NDER\nF INANCIAL INSTITUTION B ONDS 258 (Gilbert J. Schroeder &\nJohn J. Tomaine eds., 2007). Insuring Agreement B\u2019s\ncoverage of losses resulting \u201cdirectly from\u201d on-premises\nfalse pretenses means what it says. The bond\u2019s \u201cdirect loss\u201d\nrequirement \u201cmust be afforded its plain and ordinary\n\fNos. 06-3685 & 06-3794                                    13\n\nmeaning; \u2018direct\u2019 means \u2018direct.\u2019 \u201d RBC Mortgage Co., 812\nN.E.2d at 736-37 (citation omitted).\n  We have already noted that the bank\u2019s assets were\ndepleted as a result of Stilwell\u2019s fraudulent money-order\ntransactions at the bank on January 22, 23, and 24, 2003.\nThe bank disbursed immediately available funds to\nStilwell; Stilwell\u2019s account at Tuscola National Bank was\nfrozen and, in any event, empty; and the checks were\nreturned unpaid. This suffices to satisfy a common and\nordinary understanding of a loss resulting directly from\na fraud occurring on the bank\u2019s premises. The slight gap\nin time between the money-order transactions and the\nnonpayment of the checks makes no difference; the loss\nflowed directly from Stilwell\u2019s on-premises fraud.\n  Ohio Casualty\u2019s arguments about intervening or con-\ntributing causes\u2014such as Stilwell\u2019s death, his corporation\u2019s\nbankruptcy, and the bank officers\u2019 failure to follow bank\npolicy\u2014do not make the bank\u2019s loss from Stilwell\u2019s\nfalse pretenses any less direct. We have already explained\nthat tort concepts like contribution and intervening cause\ndo not apply. Those events or omissions, standing alone\nor in combination, did not cause the bank\u2019s loss in the\nsense meant by the bond; nor do they operate to make\nStilwell\u2019s on-premises fraud merely an \u201cindirect\u201d cause of\nthe bank\u2019s loss. What is important is that without Stilwell\u2019s\non-premises misconduct\u2014without the false pretenses\nunder which he tendered his checks\u2014First State Bank\nwould not have suffered a loss. First State Bank\u2019s loss thus\nresulted \u201cdirectly from\u201d Stilwell\u2019s on-premises false\npretenses, and there is coverage under Insuring Agree-\nment B.\n\f14                                   Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\n   All that remains is Ohio Casualty\u2019s argument that\nExclusion (h) operates to exclude coverage. Exclusion (h)\nis contained in Section 2 of the bond and applies to all six\nInsuring Agreements. It excludes:\n     (h) loss caused by an Employee, except when covered\n     under Insuring Agreement (A) or when covered under\n     Insuring Agreement (B) or (C) and resulting directly\n     from misplacement, mysterious unexplainable disap-\n     pearance or destruction of or damage to Property . . . .\nOhio Casualty argues that First State Bank\u2019s loss was\nactually caused by its employees\u2019 failure to follow bank\npolicy in accepting Stilwell\u2019s checks and therefore falls\nwithin Exclusion (h). This argument is based on an\noverbroad reading of the exclusion. Stilwell\u2019s on-\npremises fraud was the actual and direct cause of the\nbank\u2019s loss; the bank employees\u2019 failure to prevent the\nloss does not trigger Exclusion (h). Ohio Casualty\u2019s expan-\nsive interpretation of Exclusion (h) would swallow\nall\u2014or nearly all\u2014of the bond\u2019s coverages because a\nbank must necessarily operate through its employees. See\nFirst Nat\u2019l Bank of Manitowoc, 485 F.3d at 980-81. Indeed, if\nthe exclusion were applicable under the circumstances\npresent here, there might never be coverage for any on-\npremises fraudulent transaction because all such transac-\ntions are handled\u2014at one level or another\u2014by a bank\nemployee. See id. If we were to accept Ohio Casualty\u2019s\ninterpretation of Exclusion (h), we would eviscerate\nmuch of the coverage granted under the bond. Id.\n  On this point, Ohio Casualty relies most heavily on the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Empire Bank, 27 F.3d at 335, but\n\fNos. 06-3685 & 06-3794                                        15\n\nwe reject the analogy. As we have noted, Empire Bank\nimported a proximate-cause analysis from tort law, which\nis inconsistent with Illinois law and the general rule in\nthis context. The case is also distinguishable. Empire\nBank\u2019s employees knew that two customers were\nengaged in a fraud; in fact, one supervisor aided in the\ncommission of that fraud. But the bank employees in this\ncase were unaware that Stilwell\u2019s checks were written\nagainst an account with a negative balance. Stilwell\u2019s\nfraud, not the bank employees\u2019 failure to investigate,\ncaused First State Bank\u2019s loss in the sense meant by the\nbond; Exclusion (h) does not apply.3\n  We need only briefly address First State Bank\u2019s argument\nthat it was entitled to statutory prejudgment interest. See\n815 ILL. C OMP. S TAT. 205/2 (2006). The bank first re-\nquested prejudgment interest in a motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment under Rule 59(e), having failed to raise the\nissue in its earlier motion for summary judgment. An\naward of prejudgment interest may be within the scope of\nRule 59(e), Osterneck v. Ernst & Whinney, 489 U.S. 169, 175-\n78 (1989); Employers Ins. of Wausau v. Titan Int\u2019l, Inc., 400\nF.3d 486, 488 (7th Cir. 2005), but the rule may not be used\n\n\n3\n   Ohio Casualty also cites Parks Real Estate Purchasing Group v.\nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co., 472 F.3d 33, 48-49 (2d Cir.\n2006), applying New York law and a so-called \u201cefficient cause\u201d\nrule. Illinois has no similar rule in this context, and given\nits rejection of proximate cause and other tort-causation princi-\nples in the interpretation of fidelity bonds, see RBC Mortgage\nCo., 812 N.E.2d at 733-36, we doubt it would adopt the\nParks Real Estate approach.\n\f16                                    Nos. 06-3685 & 06-3794\n\nby \u201ca party to complete presenting his case\u201d to the district\ncourt. In re Reese, 91 F.3d 37, 39 (7th Cir. 1996) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Uphoff v. Elegant Bath,\nLtd., 176 F.3d 399, 409-10 (7th Cir. 1999). \u201c \u2018[P]rejudgment\ninterest, unlike post-judgment interest, normally is consid-\nered an element of the judgment itself, that is, of the relief\non the merits . . . .\u2019 \u201d Uphoff, 176 F.3d at 410 (quoting Healy\nCo. v. Milwaukee Metro. Sewerage, 60 F.3d 305, 308 (7th Cir.\n1995)). So while we have no quarrel with First State Bank\u2019s\ncontention that prejudgment interest may be a proper\nsubject for a Rule 59(e) motion, \u201cso long as the require-\nments of Rule 59(e) have been complied with,\u201d the bank\n\u201cshould have requested the prejudgment interest prior to\njudgment.\u201d Id. The district court was entitled to conclude\nthat raising the issue of prejudgment interest for the first\ntime in a Rule 59(e) motion, after summary judgment was\nentered, was too late.\n                                                   A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                             2-5-09\n\f",
