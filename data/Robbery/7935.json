GORTON, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAYDEN M. DADD, CONFLICT DEFENDER, GENESEO (BRADLEY E. KEEM OF COUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT. \nGREGORY J. MCCAFFREY, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, GENESEO (JOSHUA J. TONRA OF COUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n\tAppeal from a judgment of the Livingston County Court (Jennifer M. Noto, J.), rendered August 12, 2021. The judgment revoked defendant's sentence of probation and imposed a sentence of imprisonment. \nIt is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.\nMemorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment revoking the sentence of probation previously imposed upon his conviction of attempted robbery in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 160.10 [2] [a]) and imposing a determinate term of imprisonment, followed by a period of postrelease supervision. Contrary to defendant's contention, the sentence is not unduly harsh or severe. We note, however, that the uniform sentence and commitment form erroneously reflects that defendant was convicted of robbery in the second degree, and it therefore must be corrected to reflect that defendant was convicted of attempted robbery in the second degree.\nEntered: February 3, 2023\nAnn Dillon Flynn\nClerk of the Court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
