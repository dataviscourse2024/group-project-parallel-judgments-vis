YRASTORZA\n                           Decision of the Court\n\n\n\n                      MEMORANDUM DECISION\n\nPresiding Judge Jennifer B. Campbell delivered the decision of the Court,\nin which Judge Maria Elena Cruz and Judge James B. Morse Jr. joined.\n\n\nC A M P B E L L, Judge:\n\n\u00b61           Dana Yrastorza appeals her convictions and sentences for\nmultiple offenses stemming from a series of burglaries, arguing law\nenforcement\u2019s warrantless search of her historical cell-site location\ninformation (\u201cCSLI\u201d) violated her Fourth Amendment rights. She failed to\nraise this argument in the trial court, however, and has failed to\ndemonstrate reversible error on appeal.\n\n                             BACKGROUND1\n\n\u00b62            As part of an investigation into a string of burglaries,\nScottsdale police reviewed security footage and conducted surveillance and\nwiretaps. Through these investigatory measures, officers identified Gary\nEisenmann as the serial burglar and Yrastorza as his accomplice.\n\n\u00b63             After receiving a tip that Eisenmann planned to commit\nanother burglary, officers obtained search warrants authorizing them to\nsearch Eisenmann\u2019s truck, warehouse, and home. When officers conducted\na traffic stop and executed the search warrant on Eisenmann\u2019s truck, they\nfound the passenger, Yrastorza, in possession of several pieces of jewelry,\nlater identified as fruits of the burglaries. Police then executed the search\nwarrants on Eisenmann\u2019s house and warehouse. At the warehouse, the\nofficers located items purchased by Yrastorza with stolen credit cards\nbelonging to the victims of the burglaries.\n\n\u00b64          The State charged Yrastorza with multiple felonies all\nstemming from her participation in the series of burglaries. Yrastorza and\nEisenmann were tried together.\n\n\u00b65           At trial, in addition to presenting other investigative\nevidence, the State presented historical CSLI data obtained through the\ndefendants\u2019 cellphone service providers. The CSLI data revealed that\n\n1      We view the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s\nverdict. State v. Payne, 233 Ariz. 484, 509, \u00b6 93 (2013).\n\n\n                                     2\n\f                            STATE v. YRASTORZA\n                             Decision of the Court\n\nYrastorza was within a few miles of at least seven of the homes burglarized\nby Eisenmann. Neither Eisenmann nor Yrastorza moved to suppress the\nCSLI information in the trial court.2 Following a 31-day trial, a jury found\nYrastorza guilty on all counts.\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b66            Yrastorza asserts that the CSLI data used to \u201ctie [her] to the\nburglaries\u201d should have been suppressed because it was obtained without\na warrant, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Carpenter v. United States,\n138 S. Ct. 2206, 2218 (2018). Yrastorza contends that admission of the CSLI\ndata constituted fundamental reversible error.\n\n\u00b67             Yrastorza argues that the trial court erred by failing to\nsuppress evidence obtained through a warrantless search. To support this\nclaim, Yrastorza asserts that \u201c[w]ithout this cell phone information the State\nmay not have been able to tie [her] to the crimes.\u201d In general, we review the\nadmissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion. See State v. Ellison, 213\nAriz. 116, 129, \u00b6 42 (2006). Because Yrastorza did not move to suppress the\nCSLI data, however, we review this claim for fundamental error only. See\nState v. Escalante, 245 Ariz. 135, 135, \u00b6 1 (2018).\n\n\u00b68              To prevail on a claim of fundamental error, a defendant must\nfirst establish that trial error exists. Id. at 142, \u00b6 21. Once trial error has been\nestablished, we must determine whether the error is fundamental,\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances. Id. \u201cA defendant establishes\nfundamental error by showing that (1) the error went to the foundation of\nthe case, (2) the error took from the defendant a right essential to his\ndefense, or (3) the error was so egregious that he could not possibly have\nreceived a fair trial.\u201d Id. If the defendant establishes fundamental error\nunder the first or second prong, he must make a separate showing of\nprejudice, which also \u201cinvolves a fact-intensive inquiry.\u201d Id. (citation\nomitted). If the third prong is established, the defendant \u201chas shown both\nfundamental error and prejudice, and a new trial must be granted.\u201d Id.\nUnder this standard, \u201c[t]he defendant bears the burden of persuasion at\neach step\u201d in this process. Id.\n\n\n\n\n2      Although Eisenmann moved to suppress a police wiretap of his\ncellphone and evidence gathered from the placement of a GPS tracker on\nhis vehicle, the motion did not encompass CSLI data. Yrastorza joined the\nmotion to suppress, though her cellphone was not subject to a wiretap.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                          STATE v. YRASTORZA\n                           Decision of the Court\n\n\u00b69             Here, there is no trial error. The good-faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule applies to the State\u2019s routine procurement of third-party\ncall records because the incident occurred in 2012\u2014well before the U.S.\nSupreme Court\u2019s 2018 decision in Carpenter. See State v. Jean, 243 Ariz. 331,\n342-43, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 47 (2018) (searches via global positioning satellite tracking\ndevice that were conducted in reasonable reliance on appellate precedent\nnot subject to exclusionary rule). Before Carpenter was decided, nearly all\nfederal circuit courts of appeal and the \u201cvast majority of federal district\njudges\u201d had ruled that cell phone users had no expectation of privacy in\nCSLI and, thus, warrants were not needed to obtain CSLI data from cellular\ncarriers. See United States v. Graham, 824 F.3d 421, 428 (4th Cir. 2016) (en\nbanc) (collecting cases). Because the Carpenter decision had not been issued\nat the time of Yrastorza\u2019s arrest, the good-faith exception applies, giving the\nState a second vehicle to introduce the evidence at trial. See Jean, 243 Ariz.\nat 342-43, \u00b6\u00b6 40-47 (finding the good-faith exception applied based on\nUnited States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276 (1983), and the prior expectation of\nprivacy framework under the Fourth Amendment); State v. Weakland, 246\nAriz. 67, 73, \u00b6 20 (2019) (applying the good-faith exception because it \u201cis\nunreasonable to require the police to predict a shift in the law when our\ntrial and appellate courts failed to do so\u201d). Because no trial error exists,\nYrastorza has not shown fundamental error.\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b610           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                           AMY M.
