COSTANZO,                                          APPELLEE\n JUDGE, BELL CIRCUIT COURT\n\n AND\n\n COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY                              REAL PARTY IN INTEREST\n\n\n                   MEMORANDUM OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n                                    AFFIRMING\n\n       This case is an appeal of the simultaneous denial of a writ of prohibition\n\nand a writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals. Shawn Tigue (Tigue), the\n\nAppellant, petitions this Court to grant both writs, holding double jeopardy\n\nbars the Commonwealth of Kentucky (Commonwealth), the Real Party in\n\nInterest, from retrying Tigue and to also force the trial court to enter a new\n\njudgment dismissing the murder charge. The Court of Appeals denied the\n\nwrits, finding that Tigue\u2019s claim to a writ of prohibition failed on its merits,\n\nwhile his claim to a writ of mandamus failed due to Tigue\u2019s failure to demand\n\nthe trial court enter a new order pursuant to this Court\u2019s previous decision.\n\n       For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\f                               I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      The underlying facts of this case are not necessary for the issues\n\npresented in this appeal. However, a summary of the procedural history of\n\nTigue\u2019s case is required.\n\n      At the very beginning of this case, Tigue entered a guilty plea. After the\n\ninitial guilty plea, Tigue requested the guilty plea be withdrawn. Despite this\n\nrequest, Tigue\u2019s counsel did not file a motion to withdraw the guilty plea.\n\nAccordingly, this court ruled Tigue\u2019s counsel was ineffective by failing to file the\n\nmotion. Commonwealth v. Tigue, 459 S.W.3d 372, 399 (Ky. 2015). The case was\n\nremanded back to the trial court.\n\n      On remand, Tigue decided he wanted a jury trial. A jury convicted Tigue\n\nof murder, first-degree burglary, second-degree possession of a controlled\n\nsubstance, third-degree possession of a controlled substance, and possession\n\nof a controlled substance not in its original container. Tigue was sentenced to\n\nlife without the possibility of parole for the murder conviction. He also received\n\n20 years for the remaining convictions.\n\n      The case came up to this Court on appeal. On November 1, 2018, we\n\nvacated the murder conviction for several evidentiary errors, remanding the\n\nmurder charge to the trial court. Tigue v. Commonwealth, 600 S.W.3d 140 (Ky.\n\n2018). The remaining convictions were affirmed.\n\n      Using this Court\u2019s decision, Tigue, acting pro se, proceeded to file an\n\noriginal action under CR1 76.36, petitioning the Court of Appeals for a writ of\n\n\n      1   Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n                                              2\n\fprohibition to bar the retrial of his murder charge and a writ of mandamus to\n\nforce the trial court to enter a new judgment dismissing the murder charge. On\n\nFebruary 13, 2020, the Court of Appeals issued an order denying both writs,\n\nholding Tigue\u2019s petitions for a writ of prohibition and writ of mandamus failed\n\non their merits.\n\n      Tigue appealed as a matter of right. We now review.\n\n                                  II. ANALYSIS\n\n      The issuance of a writ is an extraordinary remedy. Allstate Prop. & Cas.\n\nIns. Co. v. Kleinfeld, 568 S.W.3d 327, 331 (Ky. 2016). As explained in Southern\n\nFinancial Life Insurance. Co. v. Combs:\n\n         [C]ourts are decidedly loath to grant writs as a specter of\n         injustice always hovers over writ proceedings. This specter is\n         ever present because writ cases necessitate an abbreviated\n         record which magnifies the chance of incorrect rulings that\n         would prematurely and improperly cut off the rights of\n         litigants.\n\n413 S.W.3d 921, 925 (Ky. 2013) (Internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\nThus, this Court has a two-class analysis in writ cases.\n\n         Writ cases are divided into two classes, which are\n         distinguished by whether the lower court allegedly is (1) acting\n         without jurisdiction (which includes beyond its jurisdiction),\n         or (2) acting erroneously within its jurisdiction . . . When a\n         writ is being sought under the second class of cases, a writ\n         may be granted upon a showing . . . that the lower court is\n         acting or is about to act erroneously, although within its\n         jurisdiction, and there exists no adequate remedy by appeal or\n         otherwise and great injustice and irreparable injury will result\n         if the petition is not granted.\n\nId. at 926. Both of Tigue\u2019s allegations fall within the second class of writ.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      \u201c[U]ltimately, the decision whether or not to issue a writ of prohibition is\n\na question of judicial discretion. So, review of a court\u2019s decision to issue a writ\n\nis conducted under the abuse-of-discretion standard. That is, we will not\n\nreverse the lower court\u2019s ruling absent a finding that the determination was\n\narbitrary, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\u201d Appalachian\n\nRacing, LLC v. Commonwealth, 505 S.W.3d 1, 3 (Ky. 2016) (Internal citations\n\nand quotations omitted).\n\n      In his petition for a writ of prohibition, Tigue contends a retrial of his\n\nmurder charge in the trial court would be a violation of KRS 505.020, 505.030,\n\nand double jeopardy. Tigue\u2019s argument is based upon the unfounded belief that\n\nour opinion, Tigue v. Commonwealth, 600 S.W.3d 140 (Ky. 2018), rendered in\n\nhis direct appeal, was a dismissal because we determined the evidence of\n\nTigue\u2019s guilt on murder was insufficient. Tigue further argues in affirming the\n\nburglary charge, this Court implied acquittal of the murder charge since\n\nadmitting guilt to the burglary charge was Tigue\u2019s affirmative defense to his\n\nmurder charge. Since \u201cthere is not an adequate remedy on appeal where a\n\ndefendant contends that double jeopardy would bar a second trial following\n\neither acquittal or conviction,\u201d a writ of prohibition is possible to vindicate the\n\ntype of claim made by Tigue. Dunn v. Maze, 485 S.W.3d 735, 742 (Ky. 2016).\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeals correctly noted Tigue\u2019s claim fails on its merits.\n\n      KRS 505.020, in relevant part, states:\n\n         When a single course of conduct of a defendant may establish\n         the commission of more than one (1) offense, he may be\n         prosecuted for each such offense. He may not, however, be\n         convicted of more than one (1) offense when:\n                                         4\n\f             ...\n             (b) Inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish\n         the commission of the offenses[.]\n\nKRS 505.030, in relevant parts, provides a prosecution is barred by a former\n\nprosecution if the former prosecution resulted (1) in acquittal, (2) in a\n\ndetermination that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, or\n\n(3) the former prosecution was terminated by an order or judgment which\n\nrequired a determination inconsistent with any fact or legal proposition\n\nnecessary to a conviction in the subsequent prosecution. Concerning double\n\njeopardy, this Court has held:\n\n         The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides\n         that no person shall be \u201csubject for the same offense to be\n         twice put in jeopardy of life or limb [.]\u201d U.S. Constitutional\n         amend. V; see also Ky. Const. \u00a7 13 (\u201cNo person shall, for the\n         same offense, be twice put in jeopardy[.]\u201d). The Fifth\n         Amendment applies to the states through the Fourteenth\n         Amendment. Further, the Fifth Amendment and Section 13 of\n         the Kentucky Constitution are \u201cidentical in the import of their\n         prohibition against double jeopardy.\u201d\n\nCardine v. Commonwealth, 283 S.W.3d 641, 645 (Ky. 2009) (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n      Tigue remains adamant that double jeopardy applies, and he cannot be\n\nretried on his murder charge. This is simply not the case. In our opinion, we\n\nreversed Tigue\u2019s murder conviction but affirmed the burglary and all other\n\nconvictions, holding the errors, relating to all but the murder charge, were\n\nharmless since Tigue presented no argument to the contrary. Tigue, 600\n\nS.W.3d at 170. As part of his defense to the murder charge, Tigue admitted to\n\ncommitting other crimes, including burglary. Id. In our opinion, we opined \u201cthe\n\n                                         5\n\fCommonwealth has not identified much evidence on [the murder] charge apart\n\nfrom his confession and Tigue\u2019s possession of the shotgun.\u201d Id. This statement,\n\nin part, explained why the evidentiary errors of the trial court were not\n\nharmless regarding the murder charge. However, we never made a holding that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence for the murder charge. Rather, we held the\n\nadmission and exclusion of certain testimony and the trial court\u2019s\n\nmischaracterization of the missing evidence were errors affecting Tigue\u2019s\n\nmurder conviction.\n\n      In our opinion, we actually anticipated a retrial of the murder charge,\n\nstating \u201c[o]n remand, the trial court should reevaluate Dr. Frunkin\u2019s testimony\n\nconsidering the analysis provided in this opinion and the consideration that\n\nJustice Cunningham has outlined in his concurring opinion in this case and\n\nredetermine its admissibility under KRE 702, 401, and 403.\u201d Id. at 164\n\n(emphasis added). Double jeopardy does not apply to Tigue\u2019s case and, as a\n\nresult, his petition for a writ of prohibition fails.\n\n      Tigue\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus requests the trial court be\n\ncompelled to enter the \u201cnew judgment\u201d as ordered by this Court in our prior\n\nopinion, which, in relevant part, states:\n\n         We must reverse so much of the final judgment as reflects\n         Tigue\u2019s murder conviction and resulting sentence. The\n         judgment of conviction and sentence for the other crimes\n         stand. Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court for\n         entry of a new judgment and further proceedings with this\n         opinion.\n\nId. at 171. It is clear we were directing the trial court to enter a new judgment\n\npertaining to only the other convictions and omitting the murder conviction.\n                                           6\n\f      \u201cMandamus is a proper remedy to compel an inferior court to adjudicate\n\non a subject within its jurisdiction where the court neglects or refuses to do\n\nso[.]\u201d Kaufman v. Humphrey, 329 S.W.2d 575, 576 (Ky. 1959). \u201c[I]t is the legal\n\nduty of the respondent to do that which it is sought to compel him to do, and\n\nthat he has upon proper application refused to perform that duty.\u201d Gordon v.\n\nMorrow, 218 S.W. 258, 266 (Ky. 1920). Upon a review of the record, there is no\n\nshowing that Tigue has ever moved the trial court to enter a new judgment on\n\nthe other convictions. As such, granting Tigue a writ of mandamus would not\n\nbe proper.\n\n      We reiterate that granting a writ is an extraordinary remedy and should\n\nonly be granted when a writ of prohibition or a writ of mandamus meets the\n\nstrict requirements listed above. In this case, Tigue\u2019s petitions for writ both\n\nfailed on their merits. We hold the Court of Appeals correctly held Tigue was\n\nnot entitled to either writ.\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals and deny the\n\nwrit of prohibition and the writ of mandamus.\n\n      All sitting. All concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT:\n\nShawn Tigue\n\n\nCOUNSEL FOR APPELLEE:\n\nHon.
