POPE,\n                                                  JUDGE\nSTATE OF ARKANSAS\n                                 APPELLEE         AFFIRMED; MOTION TO\n                                                  WITHDRAW GRANTED\n\n\n\n                         ROBERT J. GLADWIN, Chief Judge\n\n\n       Appellant, Andrew Deshazer, pled guilty to the offense of theft of property. He was\n\nsentenced to sixty months\u2019 probation on February 25, 2008. On June 21, 2011, the State\n\nfiled a petition to revoke appellant\u2019s probationary sentence alleging that he had violated the\n\nterms and conditions of his probation by failing to report and in not fully paying his fees and\n\nrestitution. Appellant\u2019s probationary sentence was not revoked at that time, but he was\n\nordered by the circuit court to make regular monthly payments on his outstanding balance.\n\n       A second petition to revoke was filed by the State on July 18, 2012, alleging that\n\nappellant violated the terms and conditions of his probation by using controlled substances,\n\nfailing to submit to drug testing, failing to report, and failing to make court-ordered\n\npayments on the restitution balance. A hearing on that petition was held on November 26,\n\n2012, after which appellant was found guilty of violating the terms and conditions of his\n\f                                   Cite as 2013 Ark. App. 627\n\nprobation by using controlled substances, failing to report to his probation officer, and failing\n\nto make court-ordered payments on the restitution balance, particularly between January and\n\nAugust of 2012. The circuit court revoked his probation and sentenced him to twelve\n\nmonths in the regional punishment facility pursuant to a December 7, 2012 sentencing order.\n\nHe filed a timely notice of appeal on January 4, 2013.\n\n          Pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and Arkansas Supreme Court\n\nRule 4-3(k) (2012), appellant\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to be relieved, stating that there\n\nis no merit to the appeal. The motion is accompanied by an abstract and addendum of the\n\nproceedings below, including all objections and motions decided adversely to appellant, and\n\na brief in which counsel explains why there is nothing in the record that would support an\n\nappeal.\n\n          The clerk of this court served appellant with a copy of his counsel\u2019s brief and notified\n\nhim of his right to file a pro se statement of points for reversal within thirty days. Appellant\n\nhas filed no such statement.\n\n          From our review of the record and the briefs presented to us, we find compliance\n\nwith Rule 4-3(k) and that the appeal is without merit. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to\n\nwithdraw is granted, and the revocation is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed; motion to withdraw granted.\n\n          PITTMAN and WOOD, JJ., agree.\n\n          Potts Law Office, by: Gary W. Potts, for appellant.\n\n          No reponse.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f",
