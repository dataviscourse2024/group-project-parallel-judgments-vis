Moreover, upon an independent review of the facts, we find that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490). The credibility issues raised by defendant were properly placed before the jury and we find no reason to disturb its determinations (People v Siu Wah Tse, 91 AD2d 350, 352). Concur\u2014 Rosenberger, J. P., Rubin, Asch, Williams and Mazzarelli, JJ.\n",
