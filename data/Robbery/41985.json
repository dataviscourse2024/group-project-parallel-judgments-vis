Further, there was no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s imposition of a habitual offender sentence. State v. Rucker, 613 So.2d 460 (Fla. 1993). However, the state concedes that the judgment should be corrected to reflect that appellant\u2019s conviction for burglary was a third degree felony rather than a second *1273degree felony. The judgment shall be modified accordingly. In all other respects, this appeal is AFFIRMED.\nSMITH, KAHN and LAWRENCE, JJ., concur.\n",
