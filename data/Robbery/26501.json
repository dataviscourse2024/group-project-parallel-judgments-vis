Boone complains that the officers confiscated certain items from his\n\fcell and failed to return them. We conclude that the officers have shown their\nentitlement to official immunity as to Boone\u2019s claims involving one item but not\nthe other items. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over Boone\u2019s claims as to the\nformer but not the latter. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      According to Boone, Williams and Estrada came into his cell and strip\nsearched him. Boone alleges that a handmade dog tag and wedding band, among\nother things, were confiscated. Williams and Estrada told Boone to get dressed and\nstep out of his cell. As he did so, Sanchez approached. Sanchez found a typewriter,\n\u201cslammed it on the cell floor busting it open[,] ripped the top off,\u201d and found a cell\nphone charger hidden inside. Boone had another typewriter with SIM cards hidden\ninside.\n\n      Thereafter, Boone received disciplinary reports for possession of the cell\nphone charger and SIM cards as contraband. The property officer returned certain\nproperty to Boone along with an inventory sheet. The returned property did not\ninclude the second typewriter, the dog tag, or wedding band. Boone complained\nabout his missing property and did not sign the inventory sheet. The property\nofficer told Boone to file a \u201cstep-1 grievance\u201d and took the property back to the\nproperty room. The property officer subsequently returned with the property, and\nBoone again refused to sign the inventory form. The property officer told him that\nhe was signing only for the property he was receiving since he had already filed a\ngrievance for the missing property. Boone then signed the form.\n\n      After exhausting his administrative remedies, Boone filed this lawsuit\nagainst the officers in their individual capacities, bringing a claim under the Theft\nLiability Act (the Act), and seeking damages for the confiscated typewriter, dog\n\n\n                                          2\n\ftag, and wedding band.1 See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 134.001-.005. The\nofficers filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting sovereign immunity \u201c[t]o the\nextent the petition names [the officers] in their official capacities\u201d and official\nimmunity as to the claims against the officers in their individual capacities. 2 The\ntrial court granted the plea \u201cto the extent that [Boone] seeks recovery against the\n[officers] in their official capacities\u201d but denied it \u201c[t]o the extent [Boone] seeks\nrecovery against [the officers] in their individual capacities.\u201d\n\n                                          Discussion\n\n       In two issues, the officers argue they are entitled to official immunity as to\nBoone\u2019s claims. Official immunity is an affirmative defense that protects\ngovernment employees from personal liability. Univ. of Houston v. Clark, 38\nS.W.3d 578, 580 (Tex. 2000). A governmental employee is entitled to official\nimmunity for the performance of discretionary duties within the scope of the\n\n       1\n          The Texas prison system has a two-step formal grievance process. Johnson v. Johnson,\n385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir. 2004). The step 1 grievance is handled within the prisoner\u2019s facility.\nId. After an adverse decision at step 1, the prisoner may file a step 2 grievance, which is handled\nat the state level. Id. The officers do not contend that Boone failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies through this process and assert instead that \u201cBoone filed grievances, his claims were\ninvestigated by third party personnel and it was found that his typewriter was properly\nconfiscated and all of his property had been returned to him.\u201d Boone does not seek damages for\nthe typewriter that was destroyed in his cell. Boone alleges that the other typewriter was\ndestroyed later.\n        The officers interpret Boone\u2019s appellate brief as an assertion for the first time on appeal\nthat the second typewriter was also destroyed in his cell. We construe Boone\u2019s statements on\nappeal to allege only that the typewriter was destroyed after it was confiscated, which he asserted\nbelow. However, in this appeal, we consider only the facts pleaded by Boone below. See Metro.\nTransit Auth. of Harris Cnty. v. Douglas, 544 S.W.3d 486, 492 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th\nDist.] 2018, pet. denied) (noting that when a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the plaintiff\u2019s\npleadings, the court of appeals determines whether the pleadings allege facts sufficient to\naffirmatively demonstrate the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the case). Boone also complains on\nappeal about additional items that were confiscated, but in the trial court, he sought damages\nonly for the typewriter and handmade items.\n       2\n          In his original petition, Boone expressly stated only that he was suing the officers \u201cin\ntheir personal or individual capacities.\u201d\n\n                                                3\n\femployee\u2019s authority when the employee acts in good faith. Id. Because official\nimmunity is an affirmative defense, to prevail on a plea to the jurisdiction, the\ngovernmental employee must conclusively prove each element of the defense. Id.\n(applying standard to summary judgment motion); see also City of Dallas v.\nBrooks, 349 S.W.3d 219, 225 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2011, no pet.) (applying\nstandard to plea to the jurisdiction).\n\n      When a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings, we\ndetermine whether the pleadings, construed in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, allege facts\nsufficient to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the case.\nMetro. Transit Auth. of Harris Cnty. v. Douglas, 544 S.W.3d 486, 492 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2018, pet. denied) (citing Tex. Dep\u2019t of Parks &\nWildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004)). If the plaintiff pleaded\nfacts making out a prima facie case and the governmental unit instead challenges\nthe existence of jurisdictional facts, we consider the relevant evidence submitted.\nId. When reviewing a plea to the jurisdiction in which the pleading requirement\nhas been met and evidence has been submitted to support the plea that implicates\nthe merits of the case, we take as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff. Id. We\nindulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\nId. We review a challenge to the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction de novo.\nId.\n\n      I.     Arguments Specific to Handmade Items\n\n      The officers contend in their first issue that (1) there is no evidence that\nBoone had possession of his handmade dog tag and wedding band at the time of\nthe cell search or that the items were confiscated; and (2) the officers are immune\nfrom Boone\u2019s theft claims as to these items because the alleged amount of actual\ndamages is insignificant. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider these\n\n                                           4\n\farguments because they are not based on the officers\u2019 assertion of official\nimmunity.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal of a plea to the\njurisdiction under section 51.014(a)(5) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 51.014(a)(5). That section provides that a\nperson may appeal from an interlocutory order denying a plea to the jurisdiction\n\u201cbased on an assertion of immunity by an individual who is an officer or employee\nof the state or a political subdivision of the state.\u201d3 Id. In this connection, we have\nheld that under the statute, we have jurisdiction to consider only the interlocutory\nappeal of a challenge \u201cbased on the assertion of official immunity.\u201d Baylor Coll. of\nMed. v. Hernandez, 208 S.W.3d 4, 11 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet.\ndenied).4\n\n       The officers contend that there is no evidence that Boone had possession of\n\n       3\n         The statute states that a person may appeal from the denial of \u201ca motion for summary\njudgment that is based on an assertion of immunity.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\u00a7 51.014(a)(5). The supreme court has held that \u201can appeal may be taken from orders denying an\nassertion of immunity, as provided in section 51.014(a)(5), regardless of the procedural vehicle\nused.\u201d Austin State Hosp. v. Graham, 347 S.W.3d 298, 301 (Tex. 2011).\n       4\n          Section 51.014(a)(6) allows an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion for\nsummary judgment \u201cbased in whole or in part against or defense by a member of the electronic\nor print media . . . arising under the free speech or free press clause of the First Amendment.\u201d\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 51.014(a)(6). The supreme court just held that section\n51.014(a)(6) allows a person to file an interlocutory appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the\nentire motion, including grounds not based on a First Amendment challenge. Dallas Symphony\nAss\u2019n, Inc. v. Reyes, No. 17-0835, 2019 WL 1090771, at *1 (Tex. Mar. 8, 2019). In reaching this\nconclusion, the high court relied on the language in the statute that the motion must be based \u201cin\nwhole or in part\u201d on the requisite constitutional claims. Id. at *5. The court expressly\ndistinguished section 51.014(a)(6) from section 51.014(a)(5), applicable here, because section\n51.014(a)(5) does not include the language \u201cin whole or in part.\u201d The court expressly declined to\naddress whether section 51.014(a)(5) is limited to interlocutory appeals from the denial of a\nmotion for summary judgment \u201cbased on the assertion of official immunity.\u201d Id. We thus are\nbound to follow our precedent in Hernandez: that we have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals\nunder section 51.014(a)(5) only to the extent that they are \u201cbased on the assertion of official\nimmunity.\u201d See Hernandez, 208 S.W.3d at 11.\n\n                                                5\n\fthe handmade items at the time of the cell search or that the items were\nconfiscated. They contend that they \u201cneed not prove official immunity\u201d because\nBoone lacks a claim to assert. This argument\u2014based on the lack of evidence to\nsupport Boone\u2019s theft claim\u2014is not an assertion of immunity. See id. Therefore,\nwe lack jurisdiction to address this issue. See id.\n\n      The officers also contend for the first time on appeal that Boone\u2019s claims as\nto the handmade items are barred under the doctrine of de minimus non curiat lex.\nUnder that doctrine, any error is deemed harmless when the amount of actual\ndamages is insignificant. See Smith v. Stevens, 822 S.W.2d 152, 152 (Tex. App.\u2014\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1991, writ denied). The officers have not cited any authority\nestablishing their entitlement to immunity from Boone\u2019s claims under this doctrine,\nwhich has been applied to dismiss inmate litigation when the amount of damages\nsought was insignificant. See id. (affirming trial court\u2019s dismissal of lawsuit as\nfrivolous when actual damages sought were $3.55). We decline to hold that this\ndoctrine confers official immunity from suit and thus implicates this court\u2019s\njurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal under section 51.014(a)(5). We thus\nconclude that we lack jurisdiction to address this issue as well.\n\n      II.    Entitlement to Official Immunity\n\n      The officers argue in their second issue that they are entitled to immunity as\nto all of Boone\u2019s claims because in confiscating the items, they met their burden to\nconclusively prove each element of official immunity: they contend specifically\nthat they were performing discretionary duties in good faith within the scope of\ntheir authority. We conclude that the officers have established they are entitled to\nofficial immunity as to the confiscated typewriter because it was used to conceal\ncontraband. We cannot reach the same conclusion as to the handmade items\nbecause the officers did not meet their burden to show that they acted in good faith\n\n                                           6\n\fin confiscating these items.\n\n      The Act defines \u201ctheft\u201d as \u201cunlawfully appropriating property or unlawfully\nobtaining services.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 134.002(2). A person who\ncommits theft is liable for the damages resulting from the theft. Id. \u00a7 134.003(a). In\nhis original petition, Boone alleged the following facts. The officers \u201ctook\u201d his dog\ntag. The property inventory sheet listing items \u201c[i]n [o]ffender\u2019s possession\u201d and\n\u201c[s]tored in [p]roperty [r]oom\u201d excluded his typewriter, dog tag, wedding band,\nand certain other items that were taken. Boone initially refused to sign the sheet\nbecause of the missing items. He eventually signed it because the property officer\ntold him that he was signing only for the property that he was receiving back. We\nconclude that Boone alleged facts making out a prima facie case that the officers\nunlawfully appropriated Boone\u2019s typewriter, dog tag, and wedding band. We turn\nto the evidence supporting the officer\u2019s official immunity defense.\n\n      Discretionary or ministerial duties? As discussed, a governmental\nemployee is entitled to official immunity for the good faith performance of\ndiscretionary duties within the scope of the employee\u2019s authority. City of Houston\nv. Jenkins, 363 S.W.3d 808, 814 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet.\ndenied). A discretionary act is one involving personal deliberation, decision, and\njudgment; in contrast, actions requiring obedience to orders or the performance of\na duty to which the actor has no choice are ministerial. Id. (citing City of Lancaster\nv. Chambers, 883 S.W.2d 650, 654 (Tex. 1994)). Thus, if the duty is imposed by\nlaw, then the performance of the duty is a ministerial act, and there is no official\nimmunity for the failure to perform it. Id. Because ministerial acts are those which\nthe law prescribes and must be performed with such precision and certainty as to\nleave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment, a significant aspect of\ndetermining whether an act is ministerial or discretionary involves a consideration\n\n                                          7\n\fof whether a law or regulation controls the acts of the government employee in a\nparticular situation. Harris Cnty. v. DeWitt, 880 S.W.2d 99, 101 (Tex. App.\u2014\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1994), aff\u2019d, 904 S.W.2d 650 (Tex. 1995).\n\n      Here, the officers contend that no law or regulation prescribes how they\nshould determine whether an item is contraband and whether to confiscate it.\nHowever, the officers point to TDCJ policy to support their argument that\nconfiscating contraband is discretionary. The TDCJ Offender Orientation\nHandbook defines \u201ccontraband\u201d in relevant part as \u201c[a]ny item which, in the\njudgment of TDCJ personnel, unreasonably hinders the safe and effective\noperation of the facility.\u201d The handbook further states, \u201cAny contraband found on\nTDCJ property may be taken and disposed of according to procedures set forth by\nthe TDCJ and the State of Texas.\u201d We agree that this policy allowed the officers to\nuse their own judgment to decide what constituted contraband and whether to\nconfiscate it. See Moore v. Collins, 47 F.3d 425, at *4 (5th Cir. 1995) (citing\nTDCJ\u2019s \u201cbroad definition\u201d of \u201ccontraband\u201d and concluding that because empty\nboxes in inmate\u2019s cell posed a fire hazard \u201cin [the officer\u2019s] judgment,\u201d they\nqualified as contraband). Accordingly, the officers\u2019 conduct in confiscating\nBoone\u2019s property was discretionary.\n\n      In good faith? To establish good faith, the officers must show that\nreasonably prudent officers under the same or similar circumstances could have\nbelieved that their conduct was justified based on the information they possessed\nwhen the conduct occurred. Telthorster v. Tennell, 92 S.W.3d 457, 465 (Tex.\n2002). The officers need not prove that it would have been unreasonable not to\nengage in the conduct or that all reasonably prudent officers would have engaged\nin the same conduct. Id. Rather, they must prove only that reasonably prudent\nofficers, under similar circumstances, might have made the same decision. Id. That\n\n                                        8\n\fthe officers were negligent will not defeat good faith: the test does not inquire into\n\u201cwhat a reasonable person would have done,\u201d but into \u201cwhat a reasonable officer\ncould have believed.\u201d Id.\n\n       The officers argue that they acted in good faith in confiscating the\ntypewriter. Boone challenges the confiscation of the typewriter, which he concedes\nwas used to conceal contraband. The TDCJ Orientation Handbook includes a\nnonexclusive list defining cell phones, among other things, as dangerous\ncontraband \u201c[r]epresent[ing] a threat to the security and safety of the unit.\u201d\nAlthough the list does not specifically reference SIM cards, they are related to\u2014\narguably a part of\u2014cell phones. Boone also conceded in his appellate brief that\n\u201cthe SIM cards [are] dangerous contraband.\u201d5 Given TDCJ\u2019s nonexclusive list of\n\u201cdangerous contraband\u201d and broad definition of \u201ccontraband,\u201d which includes\n\u201c[a]ny item which, in the judgment of TDCJ personnel, unreasonably hinders the\nsafe and effective operation of the facility,\u201d we conclude that reasonably prudent\nofficers under the same or similar circumstances could have concluded that the\ntypewriter should be confiscated and not returned because it was being used to\nconceal dangerous contraband. See Chambers, 883 S.W.2d at 657 (noting standard\nrequires plaintiff to show that \u201cno reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position\ncould have thought the facts were such that they justified defendant\u2019s acts\u201d).\n\n       The officers also argue they confiscated the handmade items in good faith\n\u201cbecause Boone has presented no facts or evidence to suggest [the officers] acted\nin bad faith in their handling of the items.\u201d But the officers do not offer any\nexplanation for their actions. Boone alleged that the officers confiscated his dog\n       5\n          Boone agrees that he is not entitled to the return of the SIM cards because they are\ndangerous contraband. Instead, he contends that his typewriter should have been returned\nbecause it is not dangerous contraband. But the standard is whether a reasonable officer under\nthe same or similar circumstances could have concluded that the typewriter should not be\nreturned. See Chambers, 883 S.W.2d at 657.\n\n                                              9\n\ftag and wedding band. The officers had the burden to show that they acted in good\nfaith in doing so. See Telthorster, 92 S.W.3d at 464-65 (noting officer had burden\nto establish he acted in good faith \u201cfor purposes of invoking official immunity\u2019s\nprotection\u201d). The record is silent as to whether the handmade items were\ncontraband. Moreover, presuming that the officers were justified in searching\nBoone\u2019s cell\u2014a proposition that Boone does not dispute\u2014the officers were\nrequired to prove that a reasonably prudent officer could have believed that\nconfiscating the handmade items was justified based on the information the\nofficers possessed at the time. Cf. Turner v. Fox, No. 09-12-00541-CV, 2013 WL\n5775771, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Beaumont Oct. 24, 2013, pet. denied) (mem. op.)\n(noting to establish good faith, an officer must show \u201cthat a reasonably prudent\nofficer, under the same or similar circumstances, could have believed that his\nconduct was justified based on the information he possessed when the conduct\noccurred\u201d); Gonzales v. Kelley, No. 01-10-00109-CV, 2010 WL 2650615, at *7\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] July 1, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding officers\nconclusively established good faith in using taser \u201cin response to specific\naggressive acts\u201d by inmate). The officers failed to do so and thus have not shown\non this record that confiscating the handmade items was done in good faith.\n\n      Within the scope of their authority? The officers finally assert that the\nsearch of Boone\u2019s cell and confiscation of his property was within their authority\nas correctional officers. Officials act within the scope of their authority when they\ndischarge the duties generally assigned to them, even if they err in completing the\ntask. Chambers, 883 S.W.2d at 658; see also Ballantyne v. Champion Builders,\nInc., 144 S.W.3d 417, 424 (Tex. 2004). The Orientation Handbook allows officers\nto confiscate and dispose of contraband \u201caccording to procedures set forth by the\nTDCJ and the State of Texas.\u201d We agree that the search of Boone\u2019s cell and\n\n\n                                         10\n\fconfiscation of contraband was within the officers\u2019 authority as correctional\nofficers. See Turner, 2013 WL 5775771, at *2 (holding officer was \u201cacting under\nlawful authority\u201d when she confiscated boots based on question of ownership)\n(citing Allen v. Thomas, 388 F.3d 147, 149 (5th Cir. 2004) (\u201cBecause the\nundisputed facts reveal that [the inmate\u2019s] word processor and radio were\nconfiscated under the authority of a prison administrative directive, the\nconfiscation was not a random, unauthorized act by a state employee.\u201d)).\n\n      For the above reasons, we sustain the officers\u2019 second issue as to the\ntypewriter and overrule the issue as to the handmade items because the officers\nhave not shown on this record that confiscating the handmade items was done in\ngood faith.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      Because the officers have demonstrated their entitlement to official\nimmunity as to Boone\u2019s claim for theft of the typewriter, the trial court lacked\njurisdiction over that claim and thus erred in denying the officer\u2019s plea to the\njurisdiction on that claim. We thus dismiss Boone\u2019s theft claim as to the typewriter.\nRegarding the handmade items, the officers failed to establish their entitlement to\nofficial immunity as to Boone\u2019s theft claims. We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of\nthe plea to the jurisdiction as to the handmade items.\n\n\n\n\n                                       /s/    Frances Bourliot\n                                              Justice\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Wise, Jewell, and Bourliot (Jewell, J., concurring).\n\n\n                                         11\n\f",
