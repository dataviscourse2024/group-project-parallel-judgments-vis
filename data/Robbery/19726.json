He\n           drove toward the sounds and found the woman on the\n           3900 block of Market Street. The woman, Tamia Hill, was\n           standing next to a prone and unresponsive male named\n           Robert Rose [(\u201cVictim\u201d)], who was bleeding profusely from\n           a wound in his chest. [Victim] was lying in the bike lane\n           on the south side of Market Street. [Victim] subsequently\n           died from his wounds.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n    18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(a), 903, respectively.\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n\n       Philadelphia Police Officer Kenneth Bolton was called to\n       secure the scene, where he found several shell casings in\n       .45 and 9mm calibers. The casings were on the surface of\n       Market Street. A total of eight .45 ACP fired cartridge\n       casings were found at the scene of the shooting, along\n       with thirteen 9mm Luger fired cartridge casings.\n\n       Khalif Hill lived at 3962 Market Street and knew [Victim]\n       through his cousin, Tamia Hill. At the time of the shooting,\n       Tamia Hill lived at 3950 Market Street, across the\n       courtyard from Khalif Hill, and was dating [Victim]. Khalif\n       Hill knew [Appellant] as \u201cKool-Aid.\u201d Immediately after the\n       shooting, he came out of his residence and saw Tamia Hill\n       and his cousin Troy Hill standing over [Victim]. He stayed\n       outside for a few minutes, but left when the police and\n       emergency vehicles began to arrive.\n\n       Approximately one week later, Khalif Hill was questioned\n       by members of the Homicide Division of the Philadelphia\n       Police Department. He did not give a statement, but on\n       September 30, 2010, almost four years later, he was\n       arrested in connection with narcotics, and was again taken\n       to the Homicide Division, at which time he told the police\n       that he had seen the shooting, and that he had seen the\n       two men who shot [Victim] fleeing the scene. At that\n       time, he told police that two men he knew as Mike and\n       Kool-Aid shot [Victim], and that Mike held a black gun and\n       Kool-Aid held a machine-gun style weapon with two hands.\n       He identified Michael Gibbons and [Appellant] as the two\n       shooters. He also said that Troy Hill told him that Mike\n       and Kool-Aid had killed [Victim]. He said that Troy also\n       told him that [Victim] had bought a car from Kool-Aid but\n       the transmission failed, and that because Kool-Aid was\n       unwilling to give [Victim] his money back, he shot him\n       instead. At trial, Khalif said that he had not actually\n       witnessed the shooting or heard the shots and he did not\n       see Mike and Kool-Aid leave the scene, but that otherwise\n       his statement was truthful. He also said that he did not\n       want to testify, and that he was nervous to do so because\n       it could be dangerous.\n\n       Khalif Hill was held as a material witness in this case, due\n       to the fact that he had tried to avoid giving testimony at\n\n                                  -2-\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n       the preliminary hearing and had actively evaded\n       Commonwealth attempts to secure his testimony during\n       the weeks prior to trial. He testified that [Appellant\u2019s]\n       uncle and another man broke into his house with a gun in\n       the months before trial, robbed him, and asked him why\n       he took the stand. He also testified that Michael Gibbons\n       had encountered him a week before trial in the basement\n       of the Criminal Justice Center and had asked him to\n       change his testimony.\n\n       Tamia Hill was dating [Victim] at the time of his death, and\n       she was with him the day that he saw a Pontiac Bonneville\n       for sale and asked [Appellant] about the car. [Victim]\n       decided to buy it, so they retrieved $3,500.00 in order to\n       purchase it.     Later, when she went with [Victim] to\n       transfer the title, she saw [Appellant\u2019s] name on the old\n       title. They transferred the title into her name.\n\n       On the morning of December 23, 2006, Tamia Hill and\n       [Victim] had discussed the car and the issues that they\n       were having with its performance. Later that evening, she\n       heard [Victim] preparing to leave the house, and [Victim]\n       asked her brother, Troy Hill, to walk out with him because\n       the car was acting up. Shortly thereafter, she heard\n       gunshots and went outside to find [Victim] lying in the\n       street.\n\n       After the shooting, Tamia Hill accompanied detectives to\n       the Homicide Division, where she gave a statement. She\n       gave a second statement on February 25, 2007, in which\n       she first mentioned the trouble with the Bonneville. She\n       had never seen the car again after the shooting and\n       she\u2026reported it stolen.\n\n       Troy Hill, Tamia Hill\u2019s brother, had sold drugs for\n       [Appellant] in 2007 or 2008. He worked with a runner\n       named Nate, who was responsible for taking daily\n       proceeds to [Appellant] or Michael Gibbons.         He saw\n       [Victim] outside in the street on the night of the shooting,\n       calling [Appellant\u2019s] name and complaining loudly about\n       the Bonneville. He then saw [Victim] approach local drug\n       dealers who were, at that time, working with Nate;\n       [Victim] smacked them several times, reached into their\n       pockets, and took money from them.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n\n       Troy Hill knew that [Victim] was high on ecstasy and tried\n       to calm him down, but [Victim] would not be deterred, and\n       after robbing the drug dealers he came back inside the Hill\n       residence and then left again in search of the Bonneville.\n       Hill went with him, but as soon as they went outside he\n       saw [Appellant] and Gibbons running toward [Victim].\n       [Appellant] told Gibbons \u201chit that nigga,\u201d and both of them\n       fired on [Victim]. [Victim] tried to run, but collapsed from\n       his wounds\u2026.\n\n       Troy Hill did not talk to authorities about what he had\n       seen, because he did not want to endanger his mother,\n       who lived in the housing development at the scene of the\n       shooting. In May of 2009, while he was in federal custody\n       pending trial in two robberies, he spoke with federal\n       prosecutors and an FBI agent. During his proffer, he said\n       he witnessed this murder. At that time, his family had\n       moved and would presumably no longer be in danger were\n       he to say what he had seen. In August of 2009, Hill\n       entered into a plea agreement. He received a twenty-two\n       year sentence\u2026.\n\n                               *    *    *\n\n       Sean Harris lived at the housing development on the 3900\n       block of Market Street for several months during 2006 and\n       knew [Victim] well enough to say hello to him. He also\n       recognized [Appellant], [whom] he knew as Kool-Aid. On\n       the night of the shooting, he was driving his intoxicated\n       friend home in his friend\u2019s Dodge Caravan, and he parked\n       it across Market Street from the housing development. As\n       he was opening the door to get out of the Caravan, he\n       heard gunshots. He immediately got back in the Caravan.\n       When he looked out the window, he saw [Appellant]\n       shooting at least ten times at the decedent with a large\n       black gun, held with both hands.\n\n       Harris called 911 immediately. However, because he was\n       scared, he stayed in the Caravan all night. It was cold,\n       and he turned the vehicle on in order to keep warm. At a\n       certain point, it ran out of gasoline, and his friend went to\n       get more. At approximately 7:00 in the morning, he\n       finally emerged from the vehicle.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n\n         On December 27, 2006, \u2026 Harris was approached by an\n         officer from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Police\n         Department. The officer asked him if he was okay, and he\n         said that he was not, and that he had not slept since he\n         saw [Victim\u2019s] murder. When the officer entered Harris\u2019\n         information, he told Harris that there was an outstanding\n         warrant for his arrest, and took him into custody. He was\n         taken to the Homicide Division of the Philadelphia Police\n         Department and interviewed by detectives about the\n         murder.\n\n         Initially, Harris told the detectives what happened but\n         identified a different person as the shooter because he was\n         afraid of reprisal if he identified [Appellant]. Later, he felt\n         guilty about identifying the wrong person, and in January\n         of 2012, while he was in custody on another matter, he\n         was again taken to talk to detectives about this murder.\n         He explained to them that he did not identify [Appellant] in\n         2006 because he was afraid for his own safety, but that in\n         all other respects, his prior statement was correct. He\n         confirmed that [Appellant] is the man he saw shoot\n         [Victim]. The Commonwealth did not offer him anything in\n         consideration for his testimony, though he did testify that\n         he had hoped that the detectives he spoke to would help\n         him with his case.\n\n(Trial Court Opinion, filed October 29, 2013, at 2-5, 6-7) (internal footnotes\n\nand citations to the record omitted).\n\n      Police arrested Appellant in Los Angeles, California on March 16, 2012.\n\nFollowing trial, a jury convicted Appellant of first degree murder and\n\nconspiracy.   On June 18, 2013, the court sentenced Appellant to life\n\nimprisonment without parole for the murder conviction, plus a concurrent\n\nterm of twenty (20) to forty (40) years\u2019 imprisonment for the conspiracy\n\nconviction.\n\n      Appellant timely filed a post-sentence motion on June 19, 2013. In it,\n\n                                        -5-\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\nAppellant claimed the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. On\n\nJune 20, 2013, Appellant filed a supplemental post-sentence motion, raising\n\nmultiple claims of prosecutorial misconduct.   The court denied Appellant\u2019s\n\npost-sentence motions on September 12, 2013.\n\n     Also on September 12, 2013, Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal.\n\nOn September 13, 2013, the court ordered Appellant to file a concise\n\nstatement of errors complained of on appeal, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\nAppellant timely filed a Rule 1925(b) statement on October 4, 2013.\n\n     Appellant now raises five issues for our review:\n\n        DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN ALLOWING THE\n        PROSECUTOR     TO    CROSS-EXAMINE   APPELLANT\n        CONCERNING HIS RUMORED INVOLVEMENT IN AN\n        UNCHARGED MURDER WHEN THE DEFENSE WAS\n        PROVIDED WITH NO NOTICE OF ANY INTENT TO\n        CONFRONT APPELLANT WITH THIS UNCHARGED OFFENSE\n        AND THE PROSECUTOR LATER ADMITTED THAT HE HAD\n        \u201cNO   SUBSTANTIVE   EVIDENCE\u201d  THAT  APPELLANT\n        ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE CRIME?\n\n        DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN NOT GRANTING A\n        MISTRIAL WHEN THE PROSECUTOR SOUGHT TO\n        DISCREDIT THE TESTIMONY OF A DEFENSE WITNESS\n        DURING   CLOSING    ARGUMENT   BY   DELIBERATELY\n        MISLEADING THE JURY ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE\n        WITNESS   HAD    ACTUALLY   BEEN   SHOT   BY   A\n        COMMONWEALTH WITNESS?\n\n        DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN NOT GRANTING A\n        MISTRIAL WHEN THE PROSECUTOR CLAIMED IN CLOSING\n        ARGUMENT THAT A CELLULAR TELEPHONE CONFISCATED\n        FROM A DEFENSE WITNESS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE\n        JURY \u201cCAN\u2019T BE LOOKED AT\u201d WHEN THE PROSECUTOR\n        ADMITTED OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY THAT\n        HE HAD NOT \u201cHAD THE CELL PHONE ANALYZED\u201d AND HAD\n        \u201cNO IDEA\u201d WHAT DATA WAS STORED THEREIN?\n\n                                   -6-\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n\n          DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN NOT GRANTING A\n          MISTRIAL WHEN THE PROSECUTOR REFERRED TO\n          APPELLANT  DURING   CLOSING    ARGUMENT    AS   A\n          \u201cMEGALOMANIAC\u201d AND \u201cA SHEEP IN WOLF\u2019S CLOTHING?\u201d\n\n          DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN ALLOWING THE\n          COMMONWEALTH TO OFFER EVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED\n          DRUG    DEALING   THAT   OCCURRED     AFTER  THE\n          COMMISSION OF THE CHARGED MURDER THAT WAS\n          ADMITTED   FOR   THE   OSTENSIBLE    PURPOSE  OF\n          ESTABLISHING A MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME?\n\n(Appellant\u2019s Brief at 2).2\n\n       In his first issue, Appellant contends the prosecutor cross-examined\n\nAppellant about his rumored involvement in the murder of an individual\n\nnamed Frank Trower, even though the Commonwealth did not charge\n\nAppellant with any crimes related to Mr. Trower\u2019s murder.                Appellant\n\nmaintains the prosecutor did not have a good faith basis for the Trower line\n\nof questioning, because the prosecutor did not have substantive evidence\n\nlinking Appellant to Mr. Trower\u2019s murder.        Appellant insists it is \u201cblatantly\n\nimproper for a prosecutor to ask questions which imply the existence of a\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n  Appellant\u2019s statement of questions involved does not correspond to the\nargument section of his brief. Specifically, the argument section is divided\ninto two parts, addressing Appellant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct and\nerroneous evidentiary rulings. Nevertheless, the argument section touches\nupon each of the issues listed in the statement of questions involved.\nConsequently, we address the issues in the same order in which they appear\nin the statement of questions. We are also mindful of the fact that Appellant\nmaintains the prosecutor engaged in a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d that deprived\nAppellant of a fair trial, and that we must consider the cumulative effect of\nthe purported instances of misconduct.\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\nfactual predicate that cannot be proven and which attempt to create\n\nimpressions of guilt through innuendo.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21). Moreover,\n\nAppellant claims the prosecutor compounded the error by failing to provide\n\nnotice of his intent to refer to an uncharged crime, pursuant to Pa.R.E.\n\n404(b)(3). Appellant concludes the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to\n\nask questions concerning Mr. Trower\u2019s murder, Appellant suffered prejudice\n\ndue to the questioning, and the court should have granted a mistrial on this\n\nbasis. We disagree.\n\n      \u201cA motion for a mistrial is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Tejeda, 834 A.2d 619, 623 (Pa.Super. 2003). \u201cIt is\n\nwithin the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether a defendant was\n\nprejudiced by the incident that is the basis of a motion for a mistrial. On\n\nappeal, our standard of review is whether the trial court abused that\n\ndiscretion.\u201d   Id. (internal citations omitted).    \u201c[A] trial court may grant a\n\nmistrial only where the incident upon which the motion is based is of such a\n\nnature that its unavoidable effect is to deprive the defendant of a fair trial by\n\npreventing     the   jury   from   weighing   and   rendering   a   true   verdict.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Bryant, 620 Pa. 218, 238, 67 A.3d 716, 728 (2013)\n\n(quoting Commonwealth v. Chamberlain, 612 Pa. 107, 176, 30 A.3d 381,\n\n422 (2011), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 132 S.Ct. 2377, 182 L.Ed.2d 1017\n\n(2012)).\n\n      \u201c[I]t is improper for the prosecutor to ask questions which imply the\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\nexistence of a factual predicate and which attempt to create impressions of\n\nguilt through innuendo.\u201d Commonwealth v. Larkins, 489 A.2d 837, 840\n\n(Pa.Super. 1985). Additionally, \u201cEvidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is\n\nnot admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a\n\nparticular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d\n\nPa.R.E. 404(b)(1).         \u201cIn a criminal case the prosecutor must provide\n\nreasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses\n\npretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such\n\nevidence the prosecutor intends to introduce at trial.\u201d Pa.R.E. 404(b)(3).\n\n       Instantly,    the   prosecutor      cross-examined    Appellant   about   his\n\nrelationships with certain individuals from the neighborhood near 40th and\n\nMarket Streets:\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:                 Did you know a Frank Trower?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                    Yes.\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:                 What was your relationship with\n          Frank?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                    A role model, actually.\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:                 A role model?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                    Yes.\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:           What            about      Christopher\n                   [3]\n          Stewart?

It\u2019s your testimony\n          Christopher Stewart never told you that he was\n          interviewed [by police] on February 1, 2012?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                      Not that I recall, no.\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:        Okay. Well, four days later, do\n          you remember Super Bowl Sunday?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                      I follow sports. I remember the\n          Super Bowl, yes.\n\n                                        *        *   *\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:         Do you know what happened to\n          Frank on Super Bowl Sunday?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                      Yes.\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:                   Okay. What happened to Frank\n          on Super Bowl Sunday?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                      He got murdered.\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:                He got murdered four days after\n          Christopher Stewart           was interviewed by Homicide\n          detectives, right?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:             I don\u2019t know the exact [date]\n          when he got interviewed.\n\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\n(See N.T. Trial, 6/12/13, at 273). In January 2012, Mr. Harris told police he\nhad identified the wrong person, and he actually saw Appellant shoot Victim.\n\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:            And Frank was the one that\n          called you to let you know that [Victim] had left the house;\n          right?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                    No.\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:            And when Christopher Stewart\n          told you that Homicide had reopened the case in 2012, you\n          ordered a hit on Frank in the courtyard at 40th and Market\n          on Super Bowl Sunday?\n\n          [APPELLANT]:                    Reopened what case?\n\n          [COMMONWEALTH]:          Reopened the investigation that\n          you were told you were a person of interest for in February\n          of 2007. You ordered a hit on Frank on Super Bowl\n          Sunday last year when you found out Christopher Stewart\n          was interviewed by Homicide about your murder.\n\n(Id. at 254-56).      At that point, defense counsel objected.    Before counsel\n\ncould elaborate, the court overruled the objection.             Appellant denied\n\nordering a hit, and the prosecutor moved on to a different line of\n\nquestioning.\n\n       The next day, defense counsel moved for a mistrial \u201cbased on an\n\naccumulation of things,\u201d including the Trower line of questioning.4 (See N.T.\n\nTrial, 6/14/13, at 4.) The court received argument on the matter, and the\n\nprosecutor provided his explanation for the Trower line of questioning:\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4\n  The court questioned defense counsel about the timing of the mistrial\nmotion. Defense counsel responded, \u201cI\u2019m objecting to a pattern of conduct,\nthe accumulation of all of this. What else can you do?\u201d (Id. at 28). We\nnote this is the same claim Appellant now raises on appeal. (See Appellant\u2019s\nBrief at 14).\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n         I have been told through multiple sources, through word\n         on the street, through family members of the Hills,\n         through Troy Hill himself, that Frank was the one that put\n         the phone call to [Appellant] in this murder, and they\n         thought [Appellant] and his associates believed that Frank\n         was talking. In order to silence Frank, that\u2019s why Frank\n         was killed in the projects that night.\n\n                                 *     *      *\n\n         So it\u2019s very much underlying the mindset of the witnesses,\n         and as I said, I\u2019ve heard it from detectives, I\u2019ve heard it\n         from the street, I\u2019ve heard it from family members that\n         that is what\u2019s going on and that was the motive for that\n         murder. So it goes to [Appellant\u2019s] consciousness of guilt.\n\n         Obviously, I have no substantive evidence to argue it, and\n         it\u2019s not evidence because questions are not evidence. His\n         answers are evidence. But that was my good faith basis\n         for asking those questions.\n\n(Id. at 25-26). Ultimately, the court denied Appellant\u2019s mistrial motion.\n\n      Here, the court conceded that the Commonwealth failed to provide\n\nproper notice pursuant to Rule 404(b)(3). (See Trial Court Opinion at 10.)\n\nNevertheless, the court noted the prosecutor\u2019s questions about the Trower\n\nmurder did not amount to evidence, and the jury was instructed as such.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. LaCava, 542 Pa. 160, 182, 666 A.2d 221, 231\n\n(1995) (holding attorneys\u2019 statements or questions at trial are not\n\nevidence). Additionally, the court concluded:\n\n         [T]he Trower line of questioning was limited both in\n         duration and\u2026in its impact. Given the significant quantity\n         of evidence against [Appellant] and the brief extent and\n         unsubstantiated nature of the Trower line of questioning,\n         [the c]ourt finds it impossible to conclude that it had any\n         impact on the verdict.\n\n\n                                     - 12 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n(See Trial Court Opinion at 11.)               In light of the applicable standard of\n\nreview, we accept the court\u2019s decision that the Trower line of questioning did\n\nnot have the unavoidable effect of depriving Appellant of a fair trial by\n\npreventing the jury from weighing and rendering a true verdict.                  See\n\nBryant, supra. Thus, Appellant is not entitled to relief on his first issue.\n\n       In his second and third issues, Appellant asserts the Commonwealth\n\npresented eyewitness testimony from Troy Hill.                   Appellant theorizes,\n\nhowever, that Troy Hill was actually involved with Victim\u2019s murder and had a\n\nmotive to accuse Appellant of the crime. In support of his theory, Appellant\n\noffered trial testimony from his friend, Khalil Gardner, who claimed Troy Hill\n\nshot Mr. Gardner with a .45 caliber firearm in June 2007.5                During Mr.\n\nGardner\u2019s testimony, Appellant presented \u201ca blowup of a screenshot from\n\nGardner\u2019s cell phone,\u201d showing a threatening text message sent by Troy\n\nHill\u2019s cousin, Khalif Hill. (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 32). Appellant later testified\n\nthat the purported shooting of Mr. Gardner resulted in a physical altercation\n\nbetween Appellant and Troy Hill, and Appellant \u201cgot the better of the fight.\u201d\n\n(Id.) (quoting N.T. Trial, 6/13/13, at 222).\n\n       Appellant now argues that the prosecutor made false representations\n\nto attack Mr. Gardner\u2019s credibility during closing arguments.            Specifically,\n\nAppellant contends the prosecutor informed the jury that Mr. Gardner\u2019s cell\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n  On cross-examination, Troy Hill denied shooting Mr. Gardner. (See N.T.\nTrial, 6/12/13, at 119.)\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\nphone was dead; thus, the Commonwealth could not verify whether Mr.\n\nGardner received the threatening text message from Khalif Hill.     Appellant\n\ncomplains the prosecutor later admitted that the Commonwealth had yet to\n\ncheck the phone, even though the Commonwealth obtained the phone\n\nduring trial.   Further, Appellant claims the prosecutor implied that Mr.\n\nGardner had lied about Troy Hill, because the defense did not present a\n\npolice report concerning the shooting of Mr. Gardner. Appellant emphasizes\n\nthe prosecutor later admitted he actually had a copy of the police report\n\ndocumenting Mr. Gardner\u2019s shooting. Under these circumstances, Appellant\n\nargues the prosecutor improperly misled the jury. Appellant concludes the\n\ncourt should have granted his motion for a mistrial due to these instances of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. We disagree.\n\n      \u201cOur standard of review for a claim of prosecutorial misconduct is\n\nlimited to whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d Commonwealth v.\n\nHarris, 884 A.2d 920, 927 (Pa.Super. 2005), appeal denied, 593 Pa. 726,\n\n928 A.2d 1289 (2007).\n\n         In considering this claim, our attention is focused on\n         whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial, not a\n         perfect one.\n\n         Not every unwise remark on a prosecutor\u2019s part constitutes\n         reversible error. Indeed, the test is a relatively stringent\n         one. Generally speaking, a prosecutor\u2019s comments do not\n         constitute reversible error unless the unavoidable effect of\n         such comments would be to prejudice the jury, forming in\n         their minds fixed bias and hostility toward [the defendant]\n         so that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and\n         render a true verdict. Prosecutorial misconduct, however,\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n           will not be found where comments\u2026were only oratorical\n           flair.  In order to evaluate whether comments were\n           improper, we must look to the context in which they were\n           made. Finally, when a trial court finds that a prosecutor\u2019s\n           comments were inappropriate, they may be appropriately\n           cured by a cautionary instruction to the jury.\n\nHarris, supra at 927.\n\n      \u201cA prosecutor has great discretion during closing argument. Indeed,\n\nclosing \u2018argument\u2019 is just that: argument.\u201d Commonwealth v. Brown, 911\n\nA.2d 576, 580 (Pa.Super. 2006), appeal denied, 591 Pa. 722, 920 A.2d 830\n\n(2007). \u201c[T]he prosecutor may fairly respond to points made in the defense\n\nclosing.    Moreover, prosecutorial misconduct will not be found where\n\ncomments were based on the evidence or proper inferences therefrom\u2026.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Hogentogler, 53 A.3d 866, 878 (Pa.Super. 2012),\n\nappeal denied, 620 Pa. 720, 69 A.3d 600 (2013) (quoting Commonwealth\n\nv. Judy, 978 A.2d 1015, 1019-20 (Pa.Super. 2009)).\n\n      Instantly, Troy Hill testified that he had sold drugs for Appellant at the\n\n40th Street townhouses in West Philadelphia between 2007 and 2008. Mr.\n\nHill was a \u201cstreet dealer\u201d who dealt directly with buyers.     (See N.T. Trial,\n\n6/12/13, at 20.)      Mr. Hill received drugs from a \u201crunner\u201d named \u201cNate.\u201d\n\n(Id.) Mr. Hill gave the proceeds of his sales to Nate, who passed the cash\n\nalong to Appellant.\n\n      Mr. Hill also testified that he was at his mother\u2019s house, with Victim,\n\non the night of the murder. At some point during the early morning hours,\n\nVictim wanted to leave the house and look for his vehicle. Mr. Hill escorted\n\n                                     - 15 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\nVictim out of the house. While walking with Victim, Mr. Hill saw Appellant\n\nand Mr. Gibbons running up the street with firearms.        Appellant and Mr.\n\nGibbons opened fire on Victim, who collapsed in the street.\n\n      On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Mr. Hill about his\n\nrelationship with Appellant. Mr. Hill claimed to have had a good relationship\n\nwith Appellant.   Defense counsel also asked Mr. Hill whether he had shot\n\nKhalil Gardner, and whether that shooting prompted an altercation with\n\nAppellant. Mr. Hill denied shooting Mr. Gardner or fighting with Appellant.\n\n      During the defense\u2019s case, Appellant presented Mr. Gardner, who\n\ntestified that Troy Hill assaulted his brother in June 2007.        When Mr.\n\nGardner arrived at the scene of the assault, Troy Hill shot Mr. Gardner. Mr.\n\nGardner said he almost died from the gunshot wound, and he was\n\nhospitalized for about one month.        Mr. Gardner confirmed that police\n\nquestioned him about the shooting, but he did not make a statement\n\nimplicating Mr. Hill because he feared retaliation.\n\n      Further, Mr. Gardner testified that Troy Hill\u2019s cousin, Khalif Hill, sent\n\nhim a threatening text message in 2012.        Mr. Gardner indicated he had\n\nsaved the message on his cell phone, and he had brought the cell phone\n\nwith him to court.    Defense counsel asked Mr. Gardner to take out his\n\nphone. Simultaneously, defense counsel started to set up an exhibit for the\n\njury, which was an enlarged \u201cscreenshot\u201d of the text message on the cell\n\nphone.\n\n\n                                     - 16 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n      At that point, the court asked to see the text message.       The court\n\nordered a sidebar and instructed defense counsel to take Mr. Gardner\u2019s cell\n\nphone. Mr. Gardner responded, \u201cMy phone died.\u201d (See N.T. Trial, 6/13/13,\n\nat 195.)    At sidebar, the prosecutor asked that the phone remain with a\n\ncourt officer, which the court permitted.      Thereafter, the court allowed\n\ndefense counsel to proceed with his questioning about the text message.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Gardner read the text message, which stated: \u201cAyo ur\n\nhomies are broke they on some nut shit im gonna kill one of them yall dont\n\nno me cuz. My folks shouldve killd u pussy. And yall pussys ratted on my\n\ncus.\u201d (Id. at 197).\n\n      The next day, the prosecutor moved to strike Mr. Gardner\u2019s testimony\n\nabout the text message. The prosecutor informed the court, \u201c[W]e haven\u2019t\n\nhad the cell phone analyzed\u2026so I have no idea what\u2019s in that cell phone\n\nfrom Mr. Gardner.\u201d (See N.T. Trial, 6/14/13, at 52.) The court denied the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s motion as follows: \u201cI\u2019ll just point for the record it\u2019s now 10:20.\n\nThat phone was taken from the witness yesterday afternoon I think at\n\naround 3:00, and I\u2019m not going to delay the trial anymore.\u201d (Id. at 52-53).\n\n      During closing arguments, defense counsel repeatedly attacked Troy\n\nHill\u2019s credibility. In response, the prosecutor addressed Appellant\u2019s attempts\n\nto discredit Troy Hill:\n\n           So [Appellant] gets up here and he decides to come up\n           with some bias that Troy would have had against him,\n           right? So he presents Khalil Gardner, one of his boys, a\n           younger boy, who gets up here and says that Troy Hill shot\n\n                                     - 17 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n          me in 2007, so that [Appellant] can get up here and say, I\n          fought him over it, so Troy Hill has a bias against me.\n          That\u2019s where all this went.\n\n          What was the corroboration of any of that? Do we even\n          know that Khalil Gardner was shot? How difficult is that to\n          corroborate to even say that that happened? Do we even\n          know what happened? Was there a police report? Did\n          some police officer come in here and say they responded\n          to it and they saw it? Or one of his friends who said they\n          saw he was bleeding? Or maybe a medical record? I don\u2019t\n          know. If you\u2019re shot in the belly, lift up your shirt and\n          show us the wound. He didn\u2019t even do that.\n\n(Id. at 180-81.) Later, the prosecutor again referenced Mr. Gardner: \u201cThey\n\nparachute in this witness last minute who conveniently has a cell phone\n\nthat\u2019s dead, that doesn\u2019t work, that can\u2019t be looked at.\u201d            (Id. at 182).\n\nDefense      counsel   immediately   objected,   but   the   court   overruled   the\n\nobjection.\n\n      After closing arguments, defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s\n\ninsinuation that Appellant could not corroborate Mr. Gardner\u2019s testimony.\n\n          But to say we can\u2019t confirm that [Mr. Gardner\u2019s] been\n          shot\u2026.   [The prosecutor] knew when he made the\n          statement to the jury that that\u2019s not true. He confirmed it.\n\n(Id. at 190).     In response, the prosecutor conceded that he had found a\n\npolice report regarding the shooting of Mr. Gardner. Defense counsel then\n\nasked the court, \u201cAre you going to correct that with the jury?\u201d (Id. at 194).\n\nThe court, however, declined to revisit the topic with the jury.\n\n      Subsequently, the court evaluated the prosecutor\u2019s references to Mr.\n\nGardner as follows:\n\n\n                                      - 18 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n          Though some of [the prosecutor\u2019s] comments skirted the\n          line of professional responsibility, they do not approach the\n          sum of prejudice that would create the unavoidable effect\n          of prejudicing the jury by forming in the minds of jurors a\n          fixed bias and hostility toward [Appellant]. Further, in the\n          context of the closing argument as a whole, the\n          problematic comments have minimal impact and cannot be\n          said to impinge on the fairness of [Appellant\u2019s] trial.\n\n(See Trial Court Opinion at 16-17.) We accept this analysis and emphasize\n\nthat the evidence regarding the connection between Troy Hill, Khalif Hill, and\n\nMr. Gardner was, at best, subordinate to the larger question of Appellant\u2019s\n\nguilt or innocence. Thus, the court properly denied Appellant\u2019s motion for a\n\nmistrial on these bases. See Harris, supra.\n\n       In his fourth issue, Appellant maintains the prosecutor described him\n\nas a \u201cmegalomaniac\u201d and a \u201csheep in wolf\u2019s clothing.\u201d6 Appellant argues the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s description \u201cwas especially egregious, particularly in light of the\n\ncumulative effect of his many other transgressions.\u201d             (Appellant\u2019s Brief at\n\n37).     Appellant acknowledges the court sustained defense counsel\u2019s\n\nobjections to the comments, but Appellant insists the court could not remedy\n\nthe prejudice he suffered.           Appellant concludes the court should have\n\ngranted his motion for a mistrial on this basis. We disagree.\n\n       Instantly, Appellant detailed his relationship with Troy Hill on direct\n\nexamination.        Appellant     described    Mr.   Hill   as   \u201cbad   news   in   his\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n  Regarding the \u201csheep in wolf\u2019s clothing\u201d comment, the trial court observed,\n\u201cThis is what [the prosecutor] said, although it is plain that his meaning was\nthe reverse.\u201d (See Trial Court Opinion at 13 n.5.)\n\n\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\nneighborhood.\u201d (See N.T. Trial, 6/13/13, at 221.) Appellant also described\n\nhis interactions with Mr. Hill following the alleged shooting of Mr. Gardner:\n\n          So after he did that to Khalil, I\u2019m like, I approach him and\n          asked him, like, can you, like, stop. Like, he smoke[s]\n          weed in front of the kids. He\u2026steal[s] people[\u2019s] car\n          radios. He do[es] everything in his neighborhood. He\u2019s\n          completely bad news.\n\n          So I approached him about the situation of shooting Khalil,\n          and he basically told me to mind my business and, like,\n          was talking to me like I was a child, even though he\u2019s\n          actually, like, 15, 12 years older than me. He told me to\n          respect my elder and all that kind of stuff.\n\n(Id.) Appellant testified that his conversation with Mr. Hill escalated into a\n\nphysical altercation, and Appellant \u201cgot the better of the fight.\u201d       (Id. at\n\n222).\n\n        During closing arguments, the prosecutor addressed Appellant\u2019s\n\ntestimony about Troy Hill as follows:\n\n          [Appellant testified] I\u2019m Mr. Peacemaker. I went up to the\n          most violent horrible person in the neighborhood, who\n          wreaks havoc on everyone, and I said, \u201cEnough is\n          enough.\u201d I said, \u201cGee, Mr. Troy Hill, would you please stop\n          terrorizing the neighborhood?\u201d\n\n          Does someone who is Mr. Peacemaker, who is Mr.\n          Professional and polite, go up to the guy that you know\n          shoots and kills everybody and think that that\u2019s going to\n          be a safe smart thing to do? He thinks he can get away\n          with anything. He\u2019s a megalomaniac, this sheep in wolf\u2019s\n          clothing.   That\u2019s how desperate he is.      That\u2019s how\n          desperate he is.\n\n(See N.T. Trial, 6/14/13, at 181-82.)          Defense counsel immediately\n\nobjected, and the court sustained the objection.\n\n\n                                     - 20 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n      When viewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were a fair\n\nresponse to Appellant\u2019s testimony.       See Hogentogler, supra.          Moreover,\n\nthe use of the terms \u201cmegalomaniac\u201d and \u201csheep in wolf\u2019s clothing\u201d\n\namounted to oratorical flair. See Harris, supra. On this record, Appellant\u2019s\n\nfourth issue merits no relief. Because we have denied relief on Appellant\u2019s\n\nindividual   assertions   of   prosecutorial    misconduct,   we   also   deny   his\n\ngeneralized complaint that the cumulative effects of the purported instances\n\nof prosecutorial misconduct caused him prejudice. See Commonwealth v.\n\nStevens, 559 Pa. 171, 739 A.2d 507 (1999) (stating meritless individual\n\nassertions of error lead to rejection of unfounded claim of cumulative\n\neffects).\n\n      In his fifth issue, Appellant contends the Commonwealth repeatedly\n\nintroduced evidence of Appellant\u2019s involvement in drug trafficking. Appellant\n\nacknowledges the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that Appellant killed Victim in\n\nretaliation for Victim\u2019s theft of money from Appellant\u2019s drug associates.\n\nAppellant insists, however, the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses could not\n\ndemonstrate personal knowledge of a drug relationship between Appellant\n\nand the persons Victim robbed. Absent more, Appellant argues the evidence\n\nof his drug trafficking was inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 404(b).            Appellant\n\nconcludes the court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to introduce this\n\nevidence of Appellant\u2019s drug dealing activities. We disagree.\n\n      \u201cAdmission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court\n\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\nand will be reversed only upon a showing that the trial court clearly abused\n\nits discretion.\u201d     Commonwealth v. Drumheller, 570 Pa. 117, 135, 808\n\nA.2d 893, 904 (2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 919, 123 S.Ct. 2284, 156\n\nL.Ed.2d 137 (2003) (quoting Commonwealth v. Stallworth, 566 Pa. 349,\n\n363, 781 A.2d 110, 117 (2001)).\n\n            Admissibility depends on relevance and probative value.\n            Evidence is relevant if it logically tends to establish a\n            material fact in the case, tends to make a fact at issue\n            more or less probable or supports a reasonable inference\n            or presumption regarding a material fact.\n\nDrumheller, supra at 135, 808 A.2d at 904 (quoting Stallworth, supra at\n\n363, 781 A.2d at 117-18).\n\n      \u201cEvidence of prior crimes or bad acts may not be presented at trial to\n\nestablish      the    defendant\u2019s   criminal   character    or   proclivities.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Hudson, 955 A.2d 1031, 1034 (Pa.Super. 2008),\n\nappeal denied, 600 Pa. 739, 964 A.2d 1 (2009).\n\n            The same evidence may be admissible in other\n            circumstances, however. To be admissible, the evidence\n            must have some purpose other than simply prejudicing the\n            defendant.     Some examples of legitimate evidentiary\n            purposes for the introduction of evidence of other crimes\n            or criminal behavior include: motive, intent, absence of\n            mistake or accident, a common scheme, to establish the\n            identity of the person charged with the commission of the\n            other crime, to impeach the credibility of a defendant\u2019s\n            testimony, situations where a defendant used his prior\n            criminal history to threaten or intimidate the victim, or\n            situations where the distinct crimes were part of a\n            chain or sequence [of] events which formed the\n            history of the case and were part of its natural\n            development.\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n         If evidence of other crimes is being offered for some\n         purpose other than to prove the character of the accused,\n         it may only be admitted upon a showing that the probative\n         value of the evidence outweighs its potential for prejudice.\n\nCommonwealth v. Santiago, 822 A.2d 716, 728 (Pa.Super. 2003), cert.\n\ndenied, 542 U.S. 942, 124 S.Ct. 2916, 159 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004) (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n      Instantly, Troy Hill testified that he sold drugs for Appellant between\n\n2007 and 2008, and he was familiar with the street dealers and \u201crunners\u201d\n\nwho worked for Appellant\u2019s drug network. Significantly, Mr. Hill also testified\n\nthat he witnessed Victim assault two of Appellant\u2019s street dealers just hours\n\nbefore the murder. Mr. Hill explained that Victim had purchased a vehicle\n\nfrom Appellant, Victim believed the vehicle was defective, and Victim\n\nassaulted Appellant\u2019s associates in an attempt to recoup some of the money\n\nhe had paid for the vehicle.    Further, Mr. Hill stated Victim was high on\n\ndrugs at the time.\n\n      The court concluded Mr. Hill\u2019s testimony about Appellant\u2019s drug dealing\n\nwas admissible:\n\n         Here, the fact that Troy Hill had sold drugs for [Appellant]\n         helped to establish the nature and scope of [Appellant\u2019s]\n         operation, which in turn would explain why [Victim],\n         dissatisfied with the performance of his car and in a state\n         of intoxicated agitation, would take money from the\n         neighborhood drug employees of [Appellant].         Without\n         understanding that the money he took represented sales\n         money owed to [Appellant], Victim\u2019s act, and [Appellant\u2019s]\n         retaliation, does not make sense. Further, it helps to\n         establish how Troy Hill knows [Appellant], and therefore is\n         relevant identity evidence.\n\n                                    - 23 -\n\fJ-A28012-14\n\n\n\n(See Trial Court Opinion at 12-13.)     In light of the applicable standard of\n\nreview   and   relevant   case   law,   the   court   properly   permitted   the\n\nCommonwealth to introduce evidence of Appellant\u2019s drug dealing, which was\n\npart of the sequence of events forming the history of the case.              See\n\nDrumheller, supra; Santiago, supra.
