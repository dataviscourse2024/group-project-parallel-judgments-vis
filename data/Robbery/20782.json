Miller, Superintendent,\n\nRespondent-Appellee.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Indiana, South Bend Division.\nNo. 98 C 56--Allen Sharp, Judge.\n\nArgued November 9, 2000--Decided August 8, 2001\n\n\n\n  Before Flaum, Chief Judge, and Bauer and\nKanne, Circuit Judges./*\n\n  Kanne, Circuit Judge. On June 4, 1980,\na jury found Marshall Jackson guilty of\nrobbery, attempted murder, and of being a\nhabitual offender under Indiana\u2019s\nrecidivist statute. See Ind. Code sec. 35-\n50-2-8 (1998). At sentencing, the judge\nenhanced Jackson\u2019s forty-year sentence by\nthirty years because of Jackson\u2019s status\nas a habitual offender. Jackson contends\nthat the resulting seventy-year sentence\nwas improper because one of the two\nconvictions that the jury relied upon to\nmake the habitual offender determination\nwas obtained in violation of his Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel. He advanced\nthis claim, among others, in a petition\nfor a writ of habeas corpus in the\ndistrict court, see 28 U.S.C. sec. 2254,\nand the district court denied the\npetition. We granted Jackson\u2019s request\nfor a certificate of appealability and\ncertified the following issue for appeal:\n\"Was the Petitioner denied counsel in\nviolation of the Sixth Amendment?\"/1 We\nnow affirm.\n\nI.   History\n\n  On March 3, 1975, Jackson and his\nbrother, Louis Jackson, pleaded guilty to\ntheft in a Lake County Superior Court.\nSeveral weeks later, Jackson and his\n\fbrother, represented by counsel, appeared\nin court for sentencing on March 27,\n1975. After listening to statements by\nJackson, Louis, and their attorney, the\njudge stated: \"The Court . . . now\nsentences both defendants to not less\nthan one (1) nor more than ten (10) years\nand orders them committed to the\nDepartment of Corrections for assignment\nto a proper institution. . . . Execution\nof sentence is withheld until April 25,\n1975.\" Tr. of Marshall Jackson Sentencing\nH\u2019rg at 3. Jackson appeared in court on\nMay 30, 1975 for execution of his\nsentence./2 Although the record does\nnot include a transcript of that\nproceeding, the court\u2019s minute entry\nindicates that Jackson appeared without\ncounsel \"for the reason that the attorney\npreviously representing him is no longer\nin the practice of law.\" Minute Order at\n12. Because the record does not contain a\ntranscript of the May 30 appearance, it\nis unclear whether or to what extent the\ncourt addressed the fact that Jackson did\nnot have an attorney present. The court\u2019s\nwritten order on that date simply states:\n\"The Court after reviewing the pre-\nsentence investigation now sentences the\ndefendant, Marshall Jackson, to not less\nthan one nor more than ten years.\nSentence suspended. The Defendant is\nplaced on probation for a period of two\nyears.\" Id.\n\n  Approximately five years later, on June\n4, 1980, a jury found Jackson guilty of\nattempted murder, armed robbery, and of\nbeing a habitual offender under Indiana\u2019s\nrecidivist statute. The jury\u2019s\ndetermination that Jackson was a habitual\noffender--based partially on the above-\ndescribed 1975 theft conviction--\nincreased Jackson\u2019s forty-year sentence\nby an additional thirty years for a total\nsentence of seventy years. On direct\nappeal, the Indiana Supreme Court\naffirmed Jackson\u2019s conviction as well as\nhis sentence. See Jackson v. State, 426\nN.E.2d 685 (Ind. 1981).\n\n  Several years later, on May 10, 1988,\nJackson, pro se, filed a petition in\nstate court for post-conviction relief\nfrom the 1975 theft conviction. He\nalleged, inter alia, that he was denied\nthe right to counsel at sentencing\nbecause counsel was not present at the\nMay 30, 1975 appearance. The trial court\nfound that Jackson had waived his Sixth\n\fAmendment claim by failing to incorporate\nhis original and first amended petitions\ninto his subsequent amended petitions\nand, as such, did not address the merits\nof the issue.\n\n  On appeal, the Indiana Court of Appeals\nfound that the trial court erred in\nrefusing to consider the claims raised in\nJackson\u2019s original and subsequent amended\npetitions. See Jackson v. State, 676\nN.E.2d 745, 748-50 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997).\nThe Indiana Court of Appeals rejected\nJackson\u2019s claim on the merits, however,\nfinding that the absence of counsel at\nthe May 30, 1975 proceeding was not a\nviolation of Jackson\u2019s right to counsel,\nand even if it was, that Jackson was not\nprejudiced. See id. at 751-52. To support\nthis conclusion, the Indiana Court of\nAppeals relied on two Indiana cases,\nGuajardo v. State, 544 N.E.2d 174, 177\n(Ind. Ct. App. 1989) (holding that\nreversal was not required where defendant\nhad already served out his sentence\nbecause the error had been mooted and the\ndenial of counsel at sentencing did not\naffect the validity of the underlying\nconviction), and Ford v. State, 386\nN.E.2d 709, 714 (Ind. Ct. App. 1979)\n(holding that even if counsel\u2019s inability\nto address the court on defendant\u2019s\nbehalf at sentencing was a violation of\ndefendant\u2019s right to counsel, it did not\nprejudice the defendant because his\nsentence was mandated by statute). See\nid. The court observed:\n\nAlthough Jackson was not represented by\ncounsel on May 30, 1975, he appeared for\nsentencing on March 27, 1975. Jackson\u2019s\nattorney was present and spoke on his\nbehalf at the sentencing hearing of March\n27, 1975. The transcript of the March\nsentencing indicated that the trial court\nsentenced Jackson to not less than one\nyear nor more than ten years and ordered\nhim committed to the Department of\nCorrection for proper assignment.\nAlthough the execution of the sentence\nwas withheld, the trial court ultimately\nsuspended the entire sentence and placed\nhim on probation for two years. Jackson\nacknowledged at his guilty plea and\ninitial sentence hearing that he would\nreceive a one to ten year sentence. Even\nif Jackson\u2019s right to counsel was\nviolated, Jackson has failed to show how\nhe was prejudiced. At the time of\nJackson\u2019s sentencing, [the statute he was\n\fconvicted of violating] required the\nsentence that Jackson received. The fact\nthat the trial court ordered all of\nJackson\u2019s sentence to be suspended is\ndiametrically opposed to his contention\nthat he was prejudiced. Additionally,\ngiven that any error in sentencing would\nnot affect the validity of the\nconviction, resentencing would serve no\napparent purpose and Jackson offers none.\n\nId. On March 26, 1997, the Supreme Court\nof Indiana denied transfer. Jackson next\nfiled a petition for state post-\nconviction relief from his 1980 robbery\nand attempted murder convictions, raising\nseveral grounds for relief including\nineffective assistance of counsel at\ntrial and ineffective assistance of\ncounsel on appeal. The court denied\nrelief on all but one of Jackson\u2019s\nclaims,/3 and Jackson initiated an\nappeal. Jackson failed to perfect the\nappeal, however, and voluntarily\nterminated it on June 9, 1998.\n\n  On March 30, 1998, Jackson, again pro\nse, filed a petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of\nIndiana challenging the use of his\nallegedly constitutionally infirm 1975\ntheft conviction to enhance his current\nsentence. The district court denied\nJackson\u2019s petition. Jackson then filed an\napplication for a certificate of\nappealability, and the district court de\nnied his application. On December 6,\n1999, we granted Jackson\u2019s request for a\ncertificate of appealability on the\nfollowing issue: \"Was Petitioner denied\ncounsel in violation of the Sixth\nAmendment to the Constitution at his May\n30, 1975 sentencing hearing?\"\n\nII.   Analysis\n\nA. Availability of Federal Post-\nConviction Relief\n\n  Jackson claims that his 1975 theft\nconviction was obtained in violation of\nhis Sixth Amendment right to counsel;\ntherefore, he claims that the use of that\nconviction to enhance his current\nsentence is unconstitutional. Because\nJackson seeks to challenge his current\nsentence by attacking a fully expired\nconviction used to enhance that sentence,\nour first task is to determine whether\n\ffederal post-conviction relief is\navailable to a prisoner in Jackson\u2019s\nsituation. To that end, we asked the\nparties to consider the applicability of\nour decision in Smith v. Farley, 25 F.3d\n1363 (7th Cir. 1994), in which we held\nthat federal review of a fully expired\nconviction that has been incorporated\ninto a new enhanced sentence is limited\nto situations in which the petitioner had\nno access to collateral review because\nstate procedures were \"wholly absent, or\n. . . constitutionally deficient.\" Id. at\n1370. Smith is no longer controlling on\nthis issue, however, in light of two\nintervening Supreme Court decisions that\naddress the availability of federal-post-\nconviction relief to petitioners who\nassert that an unconstitutional prior\nconviction was used to enhance their\ncurrent sentence. See Daniels v. United\nStates, 121 S. Ct. 1578 (2001) and\nLackawanna County Dist. Att\u2019y v. Coss,\n121 S. Ct. 1567 (2001). We therefore\ndirect our attention to those decisions.\n\n  In Daniels and Lackawanna, the Supreme\nCourt confirmed that, in general, habeas\nrelief is not available to petitioners\nwho challenge a fully expired conviction\nused to enhance a subsequent sentence in\na petition brought under 28 U.S.C. sec.\n2254 or sec. 2255. See Daniels, 121 S.\nCt. at 1583; Lackawanna, 121 S. Ct. at\n1570. The Supreme Court held that \"\u2019if .\n. . a prior conviction used to enhance a\nfederal sentence is no longer open to\ndirect or collateral attack in its own\nright because the defendant failed to\npursue those remedies while they were\navailable (or because the defendant did\nso unsuccessfully), then that defendant .\n. . may not collaterally attack his prior\nconviction\u2019\" through a motion under sec.\n2254. Lackawanna, 121 S. Ct at 1573\n(quoting Daniels, 121 S. Ct. at 1583).\n\n  Recognizing the \"special status of\nGideon claims,\" however, the Supreme\nCourt carved out an exception to the\ngeneral rule for cases in which the\nchallenged conviction was allegedly\nobtained in violation of the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel. Lackawanna,\nid. at 1574. The Supreme Court held that,\nif a petitioner satisfies the other\nprocedural prerequisites for relief, he\nmay challenge \"an enhanced sentence on\nthe basis that the prior conviction used\nto enhance the sentence was obtained\n\fwhere there was a failure to appoint\ncounsel in violation of the Sixth\nAmendment, as set forth in Gideon v.\nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792,\n9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963).\" Id. at 1574; cf.\nDaniels, 121 S. Ct. at 1583. In\nrecognizing this exception to the general\nrule, the Court acknowledged that \"the\n\u2019failure to appoint counsel for an\nindigent [is] a unique constitutional\ndefect . . . ris[ing] to the level of a\njurisdictional defect,\u2019 which therefore\nwarrants special treatment among alleged\nconstitutional violations.\" Lackawanna,\n121 S. Ct. 1574 (quoting Custis v. United\nStates, 511 U.S. 485, 496, 114 S. Ct.\n1732, 128 L. Ed. 2d 517 (1994)).\nTherefore, because Jackson alleges that\nhis 1975 theft conviction was obtained in\nviolation of his right to counsel, we\nwill review his petition to determine if\nhabeas relief is appropriate.\n\nB.  Standard of Review\n  Our review of Jackson\u2019s petition for\nhabeas corpus is governed by the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. sec.\n2254, because Jackson filed his petition\nfor habeas relief after the effective\ndate of that Act. AEDPA provides that\nhabeas relief may be granted if a state\ncourt\u2019s adjudication of a matter\n\"resulted in a decision that was contrary\nto, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C.\nsec. 2254 (d)(1). A state court decision\nis \"contrary to\" Supreme Court precedent\n\"if the state court arrives at a\nconclusion opposite to that reached by\n[the Supreme] Court on a question of law\"\nor \"if the state court confronts facts\nthat are materially indistinguishable\nfrom a relevant Supreme Court precedent\nand arrives at a result opposite to [that\nreached by the Supreme Court].\" Williams\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S. Ct.\n1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). An\n\"unreasonable application\" of Supreme\nCourt precedent occurs when \"the state\ncourt identifies the correct governing\nlegal rule . . . but unreasonably applies\nit to the facts of the particular state\nprisoner\u2019s case\" or \"if the state court\neither unreasonably extends a legal\nprinciple from [the Court\u2019s] precedent to\na new context where it should not apply\nor unreasonably refuses to extend that\n\fprinciple to a new context where it\nshould apply.\" Id. at 407.\n\n  In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial\nof a petition for habeas relief, we\nreview the district court\u2019s legal\ndeterminations de novo and its factual\ndeterminations for clear error. See Denny\nv. Gudmanson, 252 F.3d 896, 900 (7th Cir.\n2001). We review a state court decision\nde novo to determine whether it was\n\"contrary to\" Supreme Court precedent;\nhowever, we defer to reasonable state\ncourt decisions in determining whether\nthe state court decision was an\n\"unreasonable application\" of federal\nlaw. See Ouska v. Cahill-Masching, 246\nF.3d 1036, 1044 (7th Cir. 2001). \"[S]tate\ncourt factual findings that are\nreasonably based on the record are\naccorded a presumption of correctness.\"\nKurzawa v. Jordan, 146 F.3d 435, 439 (7th\nCir. 1998) (quotation omitted); see also\n28 U.S.C. sec. 2254(e)(1).\n\nC.   Jackson\u2019s Sixth Amendment Claim\n\n  As we indicated above, it is clear from\nthe record that Jackson was not\nrepresented by counsel at the May 30,\n1975 appearance at which his sentence was\nto be executed. What remains to be\ndetermined, then, is whether the\nconclusion of the Indiana Court of\nAppeals that the absence of counsel at\nthat appearance did not violate the\npetitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel was \"contrary to\" or an\n\"unreasonable application\" of Supreme\nCourt precedent as required by 28 U.S.C.\nsec. 2254(d).\n\n  The Sixth Amendment requires that\ncriminal defendants must be provided with\ncounsel unless the right is competently\nand intelligently waived. See Gideon v.\nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 339-45, 83 S.\nCt. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d (1963). As the\nSupreme Court has repeatedly emphasized,\n\"[t]he right to be heard would be, in\nmany cases, of little avail if it did not\ncomprehend the right to be heard by\ncounsel.\" Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45,\n68-69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158\n(1932). Criminal defendants have a right\nto counsel not only at trial but also at\nall critical stages of the prosecution.\nSee Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 9-10,\n90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1970);\nsee also United States v. Wade, 388 U.S.\n\f218, 226, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d\n1149 (1967) (\"[I]n addition to counsel\u2019s\npresence at trial, the accused is\nguaranteed that he need not stand alone\nagainst the State at any stage of the\nprosecution, formal or informal, in court\nor out, where counsel\u2019s absence might\nderogate from the accused\u2019s right to a\nfair trial.\") (footnote omitted). The\ninquiry into whether a particular\nproceeding is a critical stage of the\nprosecution focuses on \"whether potential\nsubstantial prejudice to the defendant\u2019s\nrights inheres in the . . . confrontation\nand the ability of counsel to help avoid\nthat prejudice.\" Coleman, 399 U.S. at 9\n(quotation omitted). The Supreme Court\nhas made it clear that sentencing is a\ncritical stage at which the Sixth\nAmendment requires the assistance of\ncounsel. See Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S.\n349, 358, 97 S. Ct. 1197, 51 L. Ed. 2d\n393 (1977); see also Townsend v. Burke,\n334 U.S. 736, 741, 68 S. Ct. 1252, 92 L.\nEd. 1690 (1948) (finding a denial of due\nprocess where uncounseled defendant \"was\nsentenced on the basis of assumptions\nconcerning his criminal record which were\nmaterially untrue\"). Although a defendant\nmay waive his right to counsel, see\nGideon, 372 U.S. at 340, waiver may not\nbe presumed from a silent record. See\nBurgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 114-15,\n88 S. Ct. 258, 19 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1967).\n\n  Jackson first asks us to find that the\nIndiana Court of Appeals applied a rule\nthat was contrary to Supreme Court\nprecedent. He alleges that the facts of\nhis case are materially indistinguishable\nfrom the facts in Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S.\n128, 88 S. Ct. 254, 19 L. Ed. 2d. 336\n(1967), in which the Supreme Court found\nthat the petitioners had been denied the\nright to counsel. Id. at 137. In the\nconsolidated cases in Mempa, the Supreme\nCourt considered the question of whether\npetitioners, who appeared at a deferred\nsentencing hearing without\nrepresentation, had been denied the right\nto counsel in violation of the Sixth\nAmendment. Petitioners\u2019 deferred\nsentencing hearings were held pursuant to\na Washington statute which allowed a\njudge to order probation and defer\nimposition of sentence. See id. at 130.\nBoth of the petitioners had pleaded\nguilty to an offense with the advice of\ncounsel, been placed on probation, and\nlater committed a crime which led the\n\fprosecuting attorney to move for the\nrevocation of probation. See id. at 130-\n33. At the subsequent hearings to revoke\nprobation and impose sentence, neither\npetitioner was represented by counsel.\nSee id. at 131, 132. The Supreme Court\nfound that the Sixth Amendment required\nthat petitioners have the assistance of\ncounsel at such a hearing \"whether it be\nlabeled a revocation of probation or a\ndeferred sentencing hearing.\" Id. at 137.\nThe Court\u2019s holding was based on its\ndetermination that, at such a hearing,\n\"certain legal rights may be lost if not\nexercised at this stage,\" id. at 135,\nnamely the right to appeal and the right\nto withdraw a guilty plea, see id. at\n136-37.\n\n  Although Mempa and the case at hand both\ninvolve deferred appearances, we disagree\nwith Jackson\u2019s contention that the facts\nof his case are materially\nindistinguishable from the facts of\nMempa. Jackson\u2019s claim that the May 30,\n1975 appearance was equivalent to the\ndeferred sentencing hearing in Mempa is\nnot supported by the record. In Mempa,\nthe petitioners\u2019 sentences were not\nimposed at the initial hearing. Instead,\npetitioners were placed on probation,\nwith sentence to be imposed later--only\nif the terms of probation were violated.\nTherefore, when the petitioners in Mempa\nappeared at the probation\nrevocation/sentence imposition\nproceeding, it was, in effect, as if they\nwere being sentenced for the first time.\n\n  Jackson\u2019s situation is materially\ndifferent. Although the Supreme Court in\nMempa rejected the State\u2019s contention\nthat the petitioners were actually\nsentenced at the first hearing and that\nthe second hearing was a \"mere\nformality,\" id. at 135, we find that\ncharacterization appropriate in Jackson\u2019s\ncase. The transcript of Jackson\u2019s March\n27, 1975 sentencing hearing reflects that\nsentence was actually imposed at that\ntime. At that initial hearing, the Judge\nstated, \"[t]he Court . . . now sentences\nboth defendants to not less than one (1)\nnor more than ten (10) years.\" Tr. of\nMarshall Jackson Sentencing H\u2019rg at 3\n(emphasis added). The judge also told\nJackson and his brother, \"I have imposed\nsentence for both of you as one (1) to\nten (10) years. You won\u2019t begin serving\nthat time today but you will be back here\n\fon April 25,/4 do you understand that?\"\nId. That sentence was imposed at the\ninitial hearing is also evidenced by the\nfact that, at that time, the judge\nperformed all of the functions required\nfor sentencing: he acknowledged that he\nhad reviewed the pre-sentence\ninvestigation report, ordered the\ndefendants committed to the Department of\nCorrections, and gave the defendants\ncredit for time served. Moreover, the\njudge referred to the purpose of the May\n30 appearance as \"execution of sentence\"\nand not as \"sentencing,\" \"deferred\nsentencing,\" or \"imposition of sentence.\"\nTherefore, because sentence had already\nbeen imposed on Jackson when he appeared\nfor the execution of his sentence, the\nfacts of Jackson\u2019s case are materially\ndistinguishable from the facts in Mempa.\n\n  Jackson next argues that the Indiana\nCourt of Appeals erred by holding that,\neven if Jackson was denied the right to\ncounsel, this error was harmless. He\nclaims that harmless error analysis does\nnot apply to violations of the right to\ncounsel and that the Indiana Court of\nAppeals therefore applied a rule of law\ncontrary to Supreme Court precedent.\nAlthough the Supreme Court has made it\nclear that \"[a]ctual or constructive\ndenial of the assistance of counsel alto\ngether is legally presumed to result in\nprejudice,\" see Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L.\nEd. 2d 674 (1984), the court has also\nimplied that a momentary lapse in\nrepresentation during a critical stage\nmay be subject to a harmless error\nanalysis. See Satterwhite v. Texas, 486\nU.S. 249, 256, 108 S. Ct. 1792, 100 L.\nEd. 2d 284 (1988) (suggesting that Sixth\nAmendment violations that do not \"pervade\nthe entire proceeding\" may be subject to\nharmless error analysis). We need not\nresolve this question, however, because\nwe find that the Indiana Court of\nAppeals\u2019 determination that Jackson\u2019s\nright to counsel was not violated at the\nMay 30 appearance is not contrary to\nestablished Supreme Court precedent.\n\n  Although the Supreme Court has never\ndirectly confronted the issue of whether\nthe execution of an already imposed\nsentence constitutes a critical stage\nsuch that counsel is required, see\nColeman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 9, 90 S.\nCt. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1970),\n\fJackson may still obtain habeas relief if\nhe is able to show that the state court\u2019s\napplication of Supreme Court precedent\nwas unreasonable. See Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U.S. 362, 407-08, 120 S. Ct. 1495,\n146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). In an attempt\nto do so, Jackson argues that the Indiana\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 refusal to find that\nthe May 30, 1975 appearance was a\ncritical stage where counsel was required\nwas an unreasonable application of\nSupreme Court precedent. Jackson claims\nthat, even if the only purpose of his\nappearance was to execute his sentence,\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Mempa\nmandates the extension of the right to\ncounsel to such proceedings.\n\n  The Supreme Court has directed that\nwhether counsel is required at a\nparticular proceeding is dependent on the\nability of counsel to provide assistance\nto the defendant at that point. Thus, the\ncentral question in determining whether a\nproceeding is a critical stage is\n\"whether potential substantial prejudice\nto defendant\u2019s rights inheres in the . .\n. confrontation and the ability of\ncounsel to help avoid that prejudice.\"\nColeman, 399 U.S. at 9 (quotation\nomitted). The Supreme Court\u2019s finding in\nMempa that the petitioners had certain\nrights at the second sentencing hearing--\nand therefore required counsel to ensure\nthe proper exercise of those rights--was\npartially based on the fact that the\nWashington law in effect at the time\nallowed a guilty plea to be withdrawn at\nany point prior to sentencing./5 See\nMempa, 389 U.S. at 136. Although Jackson,\nat one point, had a similar right to\nwithdraw his plea for \"any fair and just\nreason,\" Ind. Code sec. 35-4.1-1-6\n(repealed 1981),/6 that right did not\nexist at his May 30 appearance because\nsentence had already been imposed. At\nthat point, Jackson would have only been\nentitled to withdraw his plea if he could\nprove that \"withdrawal [wa]s necessary to\ncorrect manifest injustice.\" Id. In\nMempa, the Supreme Court was also\nconcerned about the possibility that the\nabsence of counsel at the deferred\nsentencing hearing would cause\npetitioners to lose their right to appeal\nbecause Washington law provided that \"an\nappeal in a case involving a plea of\nguilty followed by probation can only be\ntaken after sentence is imposed following\nrevocation of probation.\" 389 U.S. at\n\f135-36 (citing State v. Farmer, 237 P.2d\n734 (Wash. 1951)). Jackson, on the other\nhand, could not have lost his right to\nappeal at the May 30, 1975 appearance\n\"because a conviction based upon a guilty\nplea may not be challenged . . . by\ndirect appeal\" under Indiana law. See\nWeyls v. State, 362 N.E.2d 481, 482 (Ind.\n1977).\n\n  Therefore, because we are not convinced\nthat Jackson was in danger of losing any\nrights by appearing without counsel on\nMay 30, we cannot say that it was\nunreasonable for the Indiana Court of\nAppeals to conclude that Jackson had not\nbeen denied the right to counsel. The\nSupreme Court has directed that \"a\nfederal habeas court may not issue the\nwrit simply because that court concludes\nin its independent judgment that the\nrelevant state-court decision applied\nclearly established federal law\nerroneously or incorrectly. Rather that\napplication must also be unreasonable.\"\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 411. Even if the\nIndiana Court of Appeals was incorrect in\nfinding that the May 30 appearance was\nnot a critical stage of the prosecution\nrequiring counsel, we can say that, under\nthe relevant Supreme Court precedent, it\nwas not unreasonable for the court to\nmake that finding.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n  For the reasons stated above, we find\nthat the Indiana state court\u2019s\ndetermination that Jackson was not denied\nthe right to counsel in violation of the\nSixth Amendment at the May 30, 1975\nappearance was not contrary to or an\nunreasonable application of clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent.\nThus, we AFFIRM the decision of the\ndistrict court.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/* Judge Ripple was originally on the panel that\nheard this case. An event occurring after oral\nargument required Judge Ripple to recuse himself\nfrom all further deliberation and decision in\nthis matter.\n\n/1 Jackson\u2019s motion to expand the certificate of\nappealability is denied because the issues he\nseeks to raise were resolved on independent and\nadequate state grounds. Thus, federal law would\nhave no effect on the outcome. See Jenkins v.\n\fGramley, 8 F.3d 505, 507 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\n/2 Jackson\u2019s brother did not appear on this date.\n\n/3 Although the court denied relief on all of the\nissues pertinent to the case at hand, the court\ndid vacate a portion of the sentencing order\nwhich required that Jackson\u2019s seventy-year sen-\ntence run consecutively to his sixty-year sen-\ntence on an unrelated murder charge.\n\n/4 The judge was referring to the May 30 hearing at\nissue in this case; it was originally scheduled\nfor April 25.\n\n/5 At the time the petitioners in Mempa were sen-\ntenced, Washington law allowed the trial court to\ngrant a motion to withdraw a guilty plea at its\ndiscretion, and \"such discretion was to be exer-\ncised liberally in favor of life and liberty.\"\nState v. Armstead, 533 P.2d 147, 149 (Wash. Ct.\nApp. 1975).\n\n/6 At the time, Indiana Code section 35-4.1-1-6\nprovided:\n\n(b) After entry of a plea of guilty but before\nimposition of sentence, upon motion of the defen-\ndant, the court may allow the defendant to with-\ndraw his plea of guilty for any fair and just\nreason unless the state has been substantially\nprejudiced by reliance on the defendant\u2019s plea.\n\n(c) After judgment and sentence upon a plea of\nguilty, the convicted person may not as a matter\nof right withdraw the plea. However, . . . the\ncourt shall vacate the judgment and allow the\nwithdrawal whenever the convicted person proves\nthat withdrawal is necessary to correct manifest\ninjustice.\n\nInd.
