United States, 495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). See United States v. Wenner, 351 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2003). The Nevada burglary statute under which Hubbard was convicted is broader than burglary under Taylor, since the Nevada statute contemplates burglary of, among other things, a \u201cvehicle\u201d or \u201crailroad car,\u201d which are not \u201cbuilding[s] or structure^\u201d under Taylor. See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599; Wenner, 351 F.3d at 972. Therefore, under a formal categorical approach, Hubbard\u2019s Nevada burglary conviction could not be used to enhance his sentence.\nUnder Taylor\u2019s modified categorical approach, Hubbard\u2019s conviction is likewise inadequate for sentence enhancement. Hubbard was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, burglarizing a \u201cdwelling building,\u201d and he referred to burglarizing a \u201chouse\u201d in his plea colloquy. Neither of these terms is defined under Nevada law, and we cannot say unequivocally that they are narrower than the defined term \u201cdwelling house.\u201d A dwelling house includes \u201cevery building ... which has been usually occupied by a person lodging therein at night,\u201d see Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 193.014, and Nevada law defines \u201cbuilding\u201d to include, among other things, railway cars, see id. \u00a7 193.0125. Thus, someone who burglarized a dwelling building or house under Nevada law may have burglarized, for instance, a railway car occupied at night, which cannot be the object of a burglary within the meaning of Taylor and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).\nREVERSED.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\n",
