The charges stemmed from a DEA\n\nsting operation designed to halt a series of violent robberies committed by the \u201cCrew,\u201d a group to\n\nwhich the brothers belonged. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural\n\nhistory, and issues presented on appeal.\n\n       Julio and Javion contend that their sentences were procedurally and substantively\n\nunreasonable. \u201cA sentencing judge has very wide latitude to decide the proper degree of\n\npunishment for an individual offender and a particular crime.\u201d United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d\n\n180, 188 (2d Cir. 2008). We will \u201cset aside a district court\u2019s substantive determination only in\n\nexceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the range of\n\n       1\n         The appeal of a co-defendant, Jancey Valle, was initially consolidated with those of\nJavion and Julio Camacho, but the district court granted Valle\u2019s motion to withdraw the appeal\non January 6, 2015. (Order, ECF No. 148.)\n                                                2\n\fpermissible decisions.\u2019\u201d Id. at 189 (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir.\n\n2007)). \u201cThis degree of deference is only warranted, however, once we are satisfied that the\n\ndistrict court complied with the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s procedural requirements,\u201d including\n\nproper consideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Id.\n\n       The court\u2019s sentence for each defendant was based in part on pertinent facts elicited\n\nthrough co-defendant Louis Borrero\u2019s trial. These facts included Javion\u2019s role as a leader and\n\nJulio\u2019s role as an organizer in planning both the robbery in this case and prior robberies, their\n\nmodus operandi of impersonating police officers to subdue their robbery victims, their use of\n\nweapons and threats of violence, and their ill-gotten profits from stealing and reselling large\n\nquantities of drugs. The defendants declined the opportunity to contest these facts through a\n\nFatico hearing, and at sentencing the court considered the facts to have been established by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\n\n       The district court thoughtfully analyzed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors for each defendant. For\n\nJulio Camacho, the court balanced his drug addiction problems and his medical issues against his\n\negregious offense conduct, which was in sharp contrast to his stable family background and\n\nupbringing. Based on these factors, the court varied upward from a Guidelines range of 41 to 51\n\nmonths on Count Two and imposed a sentence of 90 months which, with a mandatory\n\nconsecutive term of 60 months on Count Three, yielded a total term of 150 months\n\nimprisonment.\n\n       For Javion Camacho, the court noted several indicia of his good character, such as his\n\nbehavior in caring for his brother and his girlfriend\u2019s children and his taking full responsibility\n\nfor the crime. The court also took into account potential changes in federal sentencing law that\n\nmight lower Javion\u2019s Guideline range in the future. The court balanced these factors against the\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fegregiousness of Javion\u2019s offense conduct and, in particular, his role as the leader and organizer\n\nof multiple robberies.2 Ultimately, the court applied enhancements not stipulated to in the plea\n\nagreement that yielded a Guidelines range sentence between 292 and 365 months.3 The court\n\nimposed a sentence of 250 months.\n\n       The court thoroughly analyzed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to each defendant, and the\n\nsentences imposed were adequately supported by the particulars of the case and by each\n\ndefendant\u2019s history and character. The sentences were \u201cwithin the range of permissible\n\ndecisions.\u201d Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189 (internal quotation omitted).\n\n       For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                             FOR THE COURT:\n                                             CATHERINE O\u2019HAGAN WOLFE, CLERK\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           Javion argues that the court erred by focusing on a \u201csingle factor\u201d\u2014\u201cthe right thing for\nsociety\u201d\u2014to the exclusion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. That contention is belied by the record. The\ndistrict court weighed the relevant factors, and its reference to \u201cthe right thing for society\u201d was\nmanifestly shorthand for the conclusion dictated by aggregating those factors.\n       3\n           Javion\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s Guideline range was unreasonable because it ran\ncontrary to his established expectations is unpersuasive. The Guideline range stipulated in the\nplea agreement was not binding on the court, and the court informed Javion prior to sentencing\nthat it would independently determine his Guidelines range and sentence. See USSG \u00a7 6B1.4(d)\n(stating that the court is not bound by stipulation of facts and sentencing range in plea agreement\n\u201cbut may[,] with the aid of the presentence report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing\u201d);\nsee also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the\n[defendant\u2019s] background, character, and conduct . . . which a court . . . may receive and consider\nfor the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d).\n                                                 4\n\f",
