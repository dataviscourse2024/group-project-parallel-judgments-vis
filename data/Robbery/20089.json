Appellant elected the jury to assess punishment and\r\nappellant was sentenced to confinement in the State Jail Division of the Texas\r\nDepartment of Criminal Justice for 631 days.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant's counsel on appeal has filed a brief stating that the record  presents \r\nno reversible error, that the appeal is without merit and is frivolous, and that the\r\nappeal must be dismissed or affirmed.  See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87\r\nS. Ct. 1396, (1967). The brief meets the requirements of Anders by presenting a\r\nprofessional evaluation of the record and detailing why there are no arguable grounds\r\nfor reversal.  Id. at 744, 87 S. Ct. at 1400; see also High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 810\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1978). \r\n\r\n\tCounsel represents that he has served a copy of the brief on appellant.  Counsel\r\nalso advised appellant of his right to examine the appellate record and file a pro se\r\nbrief.  See Stafford v. State, 813 S.W.2d 503, 510 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).  More than\r\n30 days have passed, and appellant has not filed a pro se brief.  Having reviewed the\r\nrecord and counsel's brief, we agree that the appeal is frivolous and without merit and\r\nthat there is no reversible error.  See Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826-27 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 2005).   \r\n\r\n\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court and grant counsel's motion to\r\nwithdraw. (1)   Attorney Ernest Davila must immediately send the notice required by\r\nTexas Rule of Appellate Procedure 6.5(c) and file a copy of that notice with the Clerk\r\nof this Court.\r\n\r\n\tAny pending motions are denied as moot.\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM\r\n\r\n\r\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack, and Justices Alcala and Hanks.\r\n\r\nDo not publish.  Tex. R. App. P. 47.2(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n1.    \tAppointed counsel still has a duty to inform appellant of the result of this appeal and\r\nthat he may, on his own, pursue discretionary review in the Texas Court of Criminal\r\nAppeals.  See Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826-27 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
