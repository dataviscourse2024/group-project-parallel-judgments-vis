TRUDO, JUDGE PRESIDING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM E M O R A N D U M   O P I N I O N\r\n\u00a0\r\nAppellant Deloes Ockleberry, Jr., pleaded guilty to burglary of a habitation.  See Tex.\r\nPen. Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02 (West 2003).  The court adjudged him guilty and assessed punishment,\r\nenhanced by a previous felony conviction, at imprisonment for life and a $2500 fine.\r\nOckleberry\u2019s court-appointed attorney filed a brief concluding that the appeal is\r\nfrivolous and without merit.  The brief meets the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\r\n(1967), by demonstrating that the only arguable contentions that might support the appeal are\r\nultimately without merit.  See also Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75 (1988); High v. State, 573 S.W.2d\r\n807 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978); Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974); Jackson v.\r\nState, 485 S.W.2d 553 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972); Gainous v. State, 436 S.W.2d 137 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1969).\r\nAs was his right, Ockleberry filed a pro se brief.  His primary complaint is that his\r\ntrial attorney did not provide effective assistance.  Ockleberry asserts that counsel failed to\r\ninvestigate the facts of the case and failed to produce evidence, including testimony by family\r\nmembers and friends, regarding Ockleberry\u2019s mental illness.  He also urges that counsel was\r\nineffective for having urged him to plead guilty knowing that he was mentally ill and under the\r\ninfluence of medication.\r\nThe record contains a copy of the presentence investigation report.  This report states\r\nthat Ockleberry takes medication for depression.  There is no indication, however, that he is mentally\r\nill.  Both he and his attorney assured the trial court that he was competent, and there is nothing in\r\nthe record to suggest otherwise.  There is no evidence to support any of Ockleberry\u2019s other\r\ncomplaints regarding his attorney.  He has not overcome the presumption that counsel rendered\r\nreasonable professional assistance.  See Jackson v. State, 877 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1994).\r\nOckleberry also urges that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to take into\r\naccount his mental health history in assessing punishment.  Given Ockleberry\u2019s criminal record, the\r\npunishment assessed was within the range prescribed for the offense.  There is no basis in the record\r\nfor finding an abuse of discretion.\r\nWe have reviewed the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and the pro se brief.  We find nothing\r\nin the record that might arguably support the appeal.  Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.\r\nThe judgment of conviction is affirmed.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________________\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bea Ann Smith, Justice\r\nBefore Justices B.
