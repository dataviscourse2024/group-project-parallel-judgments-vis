As a police officer\u2019s\n\n      testimony about Troxtle\u2019s escape and resisting law enforcement is sufficient to\n\n      revoke his probation, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                Facts and Procedural History\n[2]   On November 18, 2013, Troxtle pled guilty to Class D felony theft. 1 The trial\n\n      court sentenced him to thirty months, ordered ten days executed with time\n\n      served, and suspended the balance to probation.\n\n\n[3]   On August 24, 2015, the State filed a petition for probation revocation alleging\n\n      Troxtle committed Class A misdemeanor domestic battery. 2 The trial court\n\n      issued a warrant for his arrest. After an evidentiary hearing on September 15,\n\n      2015, the trial court found Troxtle violated his probation and placed him in a\n\n      work release facility.\n\n\n[4]   On October 18, 2015, Officer Ohlheiser received a dispatch about a car\n\n      containing two people, a male and female, with the male possibly wanted on a\n\n      warrant. Troxtle was the male in the car. Officer Ohlheiser told Troxtle to get\n\n      out of the car, told him he was under arrest, and started to handcuff him.\n\n      Troxtle spun away and ran. Another officer grabbed Troxtle and a tussle\n\n      ensued with Troxtle ultimately escaping.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Ind. Code \u00a7 35-43-4-2 (2009).\n      2\n          Ind. Code \u00a7 35-42-2-1.3 (2014).\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 48A02-1602-CR-325 | September 28, 2016   Page 2 of 5\n\f[5]   The State filed a new petition to revoke probation alleging Troxtle committed\n\n      Level 5 felony escape 3 and Class A misdemeanor resisting law enforcement. 4\n\n      Troxtle had an initial hearing on November 30, 2015. The trial court held an\n\n      evidentiary hearing on January 1, 2016, and Office Ohlheiser testified about the\n\n      events of October 18, 2015. The trial court found Troxtle violated his probation\n\n      and ordered Troxtle serve the rest of his sentence in the Indiana Department of\n\n      Correction.\n\n\n\n                                     Discussion and Decision\n[6]   The evidence was sufficient to revoke Troxtle\u2019s probation. A trial court may\n\n      revoke probation if a person commits another crime. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2-\n\n      1(b)(2) (2012). A criminal conviction is not necessary to revoke probation.\n\n      Dokes v. State, 971 N.E.2d 178, 180 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012). The State must prove\n\n      a violation of probation by a preponderance of the evidence. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-\n\n      2-3(f) (2015).\n\n\n[7]   When reviewing a trial court\u2019s finding of a probation violation, we may not\n\n      reweigh the evidence or reevaluate the credibility of witnesses. Woods v. State,\n\n      892 N.E.2d 637, 639 (Ind. 2008). We instead look at the evidence most\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          Ind. Code \u00a7 35-44.1-3-4 (2014).\n      4\n          Ind. Code \u00a7 35-44.1-3-1 (2014).\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 48A02-1602-CR-325 | September 28, 2016   Page 3 of 5\n\f      favorable to the trial court\u2019s decision and affirm if there is substantial evidence\n\n      of probative value supporting the judgment. Id. at 639-40.\n\n\n[8]   There was substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s ruling. The State\n\n      alleged Troxtle violated probation by committing escape and resisting law\n\n      enforcement. Escape occurs when a person intentionally flees from lawful\n\n      detention. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-44.1-3-4(a). Resisting law enforcement occurs when\n\n      a person intentionally or knowingly \u201cforcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes\n\n      with a law enforcement officer or a person assisting the officer while the officer\n\n      is lawfully engaged in the execution of the officer\u2019s duties.\u201d Ind. Code \u00a7 35-\n\n      44.1-3-1(a)(1). Resisting law enforcement can also occur when a person\n\n      intentionally or knowingly \u201cflees from a law enforcement officer after the\n\n      officer has, by visible or audible means, including operation of the law\n\n      enforcement officer\u2019s siren or emergency lights, identified himself or herself and\n\n      ordered the person to stop.\u201d Ind. Code \u00a7 35-44.1-3-1(a)(3).\n\n\n[9]   Officer Ohlheiser told Troxtle he was under arrest and attempted to handcuff\n\n      him. Troxtle spun away and ran, which prevented Ohlheiser from handcuffing\n\n      him. Troxtle then tussled with another officer and continued to run. Troxtle\n\n      argues this evidence was insufficient to find he violated his probation, but our\n\n      Indiana Supreme Court has upheld a probation revocation when a police officer\n\n      testified to facts demonstrating a probationer violated the law. Murdock v. State,\n\n      10 N.E.3d 1265, 1268 (Ind. 2014). Based on Officer Ohlheiser\u2019s testimony,\n\n      Troxtle resisted law enforcement and escaped, and thus the evidence was\n\n      sufficient to revoke his probation. See Thornton v. State, 792 N.E.2d 94, 99 (Ind.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 48A02-1602-CR-325 | September 28, 2016   Page 4 of 5\n\f       Ct. App. 2003) (revoking probation based on commission of a subsequent crime\n\n       even though a jury acquitted him of that crime).\n\n\n\n                                               Conclusion\n[10]   Sufficient evidence supported the revocation of Troxtle\u2019s probation, and we\n\n       accordingly affirm.\n\n\n[11]   Affirmed.\n\n\n       Kirsch, J., and Crone, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 48A02-1602-CR-325 | September 28, 2016   Page 5 of 5\n\f",
