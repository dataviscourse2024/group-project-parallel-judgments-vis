Ct. No. 00F04465)\n\n         v.\n\nCONNOR GENE JOHNSON,\n\n                   Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n         This case comes to us pursuant to People v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436 (Wende).\nHaving reviewed the record as required by Wende, we affirm the judgment.\n         We provide the following brief description of the facts and procedural history of\nthe case. (See People v. Kelly (2006) 40 Cal.4th 106, 110, 124.)\n                        PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n         In October 2000, a jury found defendant Connor Gene Johnson guilty of second\ndegree robbery, and sustained true findings on two prior serious felony enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fThe trial court sentenced defendant under the three strikes law to a term of 35 years to\nlife.\n        On January 24, 2013, defendant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus\nrequesting his sentence be recalled and he be resentenced pursuant to Penal Code section\n1170.126.1 The trial court construed the petition as a section 1170.126 motion for\nresentencing. The trial court then denied the motion, noting that defendant was ineligible\nfor resentencing under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(1), as the jury convicted him of\na serious felony. Defendant appeals that denial.\n                                    WENDE REVIEW\n        We appointed counsel to represent defendant on appeal. Counsel filed an opening\nbrief that sets forth the facts of the case and requests this court to review the record and\ndetermine whether there are any arguable issues on appeal. (Wende, supra, 25 Cal.3d\n436.) Defendant was advised by counsel of the right to file a supplemental brief within\n30 days of the date of filing of the opening brief. More than 30 days have elapsed, and\nwe have received no communication from defendant. Having undertaken an examination\nof the entire record, we find no arguable error that would result in a disposition more\nfavorable to defendant.\n\n\n\n\n1 Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code in effect at the time of the\ncharged offense.\n\n                                              2\n\f                                 DISPOSITION\n     The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                               MURRAY   , J.\n\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n     BLEASE             , Acting P.
