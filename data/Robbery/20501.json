State, 214\r\nS.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the complainant\r\npositively identified appellant as the robber at trial and testified that,\r\nduring the robbery, appellant had pointed a Tech-9[2]\r\nsemiautomatic pistol at him.\u00a0 When police arrived, the complainant went in\r\ntheir patrol car with them to look for the robber, whom the complainant\r\ndescribed as a Hispanic male wearing a white t-shirt.\u00a0 When they came upon\r\nappellant, the complainant=s sight was Akind of fuzzy@ from that distance because he had lost his eyeglasses while\r\nrunning away from the robber, but he testified that he could still recognize\r\nappellant as the robber.\u00a0 When the police then ordered appellant to Afreeze,@ he tried to run away, but was soon\r\napprehended, and the Tech-9 handgun, wrapped in a t-shirt, was recovered.\u00a0\r\nWhile appellant was sitting in the back of the police car, the complainant\r\npositively identified appellant as the robber.\u00a0 Although the complainant still\r\ndid not have his eyeglasses at that time, he testified that he was nearsighted\r\nbut could see well that close.\u00a0 He also stated that he had been wearing his\r\neyeglasses during the robbery, which occurred on a well lit street, so he had\r\nseen, and could remember, appellant=s face well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the police officers dispatched\r\nto the scene confirmed that, when they saw appellant walking down the street\r\nwith something wrapped in a t-shirt, the complainant immediately recognized\r\nappellant as the robber and later positively identified him.\u00a0 The officer also\r\nrecalled that when appellant was arrested, he was calm and collected and said: ADo me for the gun.\u00a0 I can=t go down for the robbery.@\u00a0 Although the officer testified that\r\nthe complainant had described the robber as wearing no shirt and blue shorts\r\n(rather than the blue jeans and no shirt he was wearing when arrested), he also\r\nstated that it is not unusual for people to give a description that is not\r\nexact because it is easier for people to recognize somebody than to describe\r\nthem and that the complainant was very sure that appellant was the robber when\r\nhe identified him.\u00a0 Appellant also admitted to owning the gun in evidence.\u00a0\r\nViewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, this evidence is legally\r\nsufficient to prove that appellant was the person who committed the robbery,\r\nand appellant=s first issue is overruled.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 In reviewing factual sufficiency,\r\nwe view all of the evidence in a neutral light, and set aside the verdict only\r\nif proof of guilt is so weak that the verdict is clearly wrong or manifestly\r\nunjust, or the contrary evidence is so strong that the standard of proof beyond\r\na reasonable doubt could not have been met.\u00a0 Garza v. State, 213 S.W.3d\r\n338, 344 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\u00a0 In this case, although there were discrepancies\r\nin the complainant=s descriptions of appellant, they were not of such a\r\nmagnitude as to render the proof of guilt so weak that the verdict is clearly\r\nwrong or manifestly unjust.\u00a0 Similarly, although appellant denied committing\r\nthe robbery, there is no other contrary evidence.\u00a0 Therefore, the contrary\r\nevidence is not so strong that the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt\r\ncould not have been met.\u00a0 Accordingly, appellant=s second issue is overruled, and the\r\njudgment of the trial court is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n/s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Richard H.
