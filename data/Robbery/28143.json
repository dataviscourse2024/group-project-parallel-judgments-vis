            "opinion_text": "\nLawrence-Berrey, J.\n\u00b61 A jury found Julio Davila guilty of second degree murder. The key piece of evidence *158tying Mr. Davila to the murder was a baseball bat containing Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA.1 During trial, Mr. Davila did not know that the forensic analyst who tested the DNA had been fired from her job due to a long history of incompetence in conducting DNA tests. The trial court denied Mr. Davila\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this information. On appeal, Mr. Davila contends the State\u2019s failure to disclose material evidence impeaching an important witness for the State violates Brady. 2 He also contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing inconsistent theories of culpability at two separate trials.\n\u00b62 We conclude that there was no Brady violation because there was no evidence of DNA cross contamination in this case and, therefore, the nondisclosure of the information was not material. We also conclude that no pro-secutorial misconduct took place. A prosecutor may argue inconsistent theories of culpability at separate trials when, as here, new evidence that supports the second theory comes to light after the first trial. We, therefore, affirm.\nFACTS\n\u00b63 In the early morning hours of June 18, 2007, Jeramie Davis called 911 to report that he had discovered John G. Allen, the owner of an adult material bookstore, on the store\u2019s floor. When Officer Brian Cestnik responded, he found Mr. Allen unconscious on the floor with a baseball bat under his knees. After paramedics took Mr. Allen to the hospital, Officer Cestnik placed the baseball bat on a shelf close to where Mr. Allen had been found. Mr. Allen later died at a hospital due to blunt force trauma to the head.\n\u00b64 Officer Cestnik interviewed Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis told the officer that he found Mr. Allen on the floor earlier that *159evening but thought he had passed out, so he left. According to Mr. Davis, he later returned to the bookstore at the encouragement of his sister and then called police. An investigator later swabbed four areas of the baseball bat and submitted the swabs, labeled A, B, C, and D, for testing at the Washington State Patrol\u2019s Crime Laboratory (WSP crime lab).\n\u00b65 Denise Olson, a forensic analyst for the WSP crime lab, tested the four swabs. Her report stated that she used \u201ca standard DNA extraction protocol\u201d in evaluating the swabs. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 274. After extracting DNA from the swabs, she quantified them for human DNA levels and then amplified them. She concluded that one of the swabs contained DNA from Mr. Allen and excluded Mr. Davis. She obtained a \u201cpartial DNA typing profile from swab D,\u201d which had been taken from the handle of the bat, and concluded the swab was \u201ca mixture of at least two individuals.\u201d CP at 275. Her report stated, \u201cThe major contributor is an unidentified male, designated Unknown Individual A....Jeramie Davis is excluded as a contributor to this profile.\u201d CP at 275.\n\u00b66 Mr. Davis was eventually charged with first degree murder for causing Mr. Allen\u2019s death. At trial, two witnesses testified that Mr. Davis admitted that he stole some money, checks, and pornography from Mr. Allen\u2019s store on the night of the murder. The prosecution argued that the detectives had \u201cruled out any other suspect\u201d other than Mr. Davis. CP at 76. During closing argument, the prosecution also argued that Mr. Davis hit Mr. Allen \u201cover the head with the baseball bat\u201d and then \u201cclean [ed] out the store.\u201d CP at 76. In response to Mr. Davis\u2019s argument that DNA on the bat showed someone else was the killer, the prosecution countered that Mr. Davis had worn gloves while inside the store. Mr. Davis was convicted of first degree murder for causing Mr. Allen\u2019s death. This court affirmed the conviction in an unpublished decision. State v. Davis, noted at 151 Wn. App. 1047, 2009 WL 2480132, 2009 Wash. App. LEXIS 2029.\n*160\u00b67 After Mr. Davis\u2019s conviction, detectives continued to get information about individuals whose fingerprints matched previously unidentified fingerprints lifted from Mr. Allen\u2019s store and truck. In 2011, a Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) search of the \u201c \u2018unknown Individual A\u2019 \u201d swab was identified as matching the profile of Mr. Davila. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 290; CP at 4. The State charged Mr. Davila with murder under two different theories: first degree felony murder for working with Mr. Davis to commit a robbery and thereby causing Mr. Allen\u2019s death, and second degree felony murder for causing Mr. Allen\u2019s death in the course of an assault or attempted assault in the second degree. During questioning, Mr. Davila denied knowing Mr. Allen or Mr. Davis or having any involvement in the murder.\n\u00b68 At trial, State\u2019s witnesses carefully detailed the chain of custody of key pieces of evidence. Detective Cestnik, who had become a detective after the Davis trial, testified that Mr. Allen was lying in a pool of blood with magazines next to him. Detective Cestnik stated that he wore gloves when he moved the baseball bat from the floor to preserve any potential DNA evidence. During cross-examination, Detective Cestnik admitted that he did not place the baseball bat in a paper bag and that the handle of the bat was resting on top of some boxed DVDs.\n\u00b69 Detective John Miller testified that he collected evidence from the crime scene. He testified that some of Mr. Allen\u2019s relatives arrived during the investigation and informed him that Mr. Allen\u2019s truck was missing. Patrol officers later located the truck. The detective directed forensic personnel, Carrie Johnson and Lori Preuninger, to gather fingerprints from inside the truck and store. Fingerprints taken from a counter close to where Mr. Allen was found matched Mr. Davila\u2019s.\n\u00b610 Detective Timothy Madsen, the lead detective on the case, testified that he investigated the interior of Mr. Allen\u2019s store after interviewing Mr. Davis. He removed the *161baseball bat and had forensic personnel check for latent prints on countertops and items inside the store. He also had forensic technicians swab the steering wheel of Mr. Allen\u2019s truck. According to Detective Madsen, Ms. Preuninger swabbed four different areas of the baseball bat. Detective Madsen then submitted those swabs to the WSP crime lab. He explained that once the evidence was collected, it was placed in sealed envelopes and then stored in the property room. Detective Madsen testified that he personally took the evidence from the property room to the WSP crime lab for testing.\n\u00b611 The State did not call Ms. Olson to discuss her initial testing of the evidence. Instead, it called Lorraine Heath, the supervising forensic scientist for the WSP crime lab. Ms. Heath testified that she retested \u201cswab D\u201d from the baseball bat and concluded that the unknown profile matched Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA profile. RP at 436-37. Ms. Heath explained the WSP crime lab\u2019s contamination prevention procedures and controls. She also testified that she reviewed Ms. Olson\u2019s previous testing of sample D and the steering wheel swabs. She explained that due to the low level of DNA from the steering wheel swab, \u201cJulio Davila can be neither included nor excluded as a possible contributor to [the] profile.\u201d RP at 446. During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Ms. Heath about the possibility of a \u201csecondary transfer\u201d of DNA from other sources to the baseball bat but did not question her about Ms. Olson\u2019s original handling of the evidence. RP at 458. Ms. Preuninger, a forensic specialist for the Spokane County Sheriff\u2019s Office, swabbed the bat and detailed the precautions to prevent contamination.\n\u00b612 After the State rested, Mr. Davila moved to dismiss the charges for insufficient evidence. The trial court dismissed the first degree murder charge, finding there was no evidence that Mr. Davila was an accomplice to the robbery committed by Mr. Davis.\n\u00b613 During closing argument, the prosecution emphasized that the investigation and handling of the evidence *162was meticulous and professional. He reminded the jury that Detective Madsen secured the scene and that everyone wore gloves. The bat was secured in a property room, and Ms. Preuninger swabbed the bat in four locations and gave the swabs to Detective Madsen. The prosecutor highlighted \u201cthe great care and procedures that [Ms. Preuninger] use[d] to make sure that those swabs [were] not contaminated.\u201d RP at 537-38. The State concluded, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we know whose DNA that is now. We didn\u2019t have Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA in the system back when we were initially investigating this crime, but now we know who swung that bat; Julio Davila swung the bat.\u201d RP at 543.\n\u00b614 The defense\u2019s theory was that Mr. Davis killed Mr. Allen. Defense counsel argued that \u201c[t]he evidence pointed directly to [Mr. Davis]\u201d and attributed the absence of DNA and fingerprint evidence to Mr. Davis\u2019s use of gloves. RP at 544. The prosecutor responded that what Mr. Davis did was \u201cinexcusable,\u201d but \u201cMr. Davis, according to the evidence, didn\u2019t swing the bat.\u201d RP at 556. The prosecutor then returned to the strength of the DNA evidence: \u201cWhose DNA was on the bat? Mr. Davila swung the bat.\u201d RP at 559. The jury found Mr. Davila guilty of second degree murder.3\n\u00b615 Before sentencing, defense counsel learned that Ms. Olson had been fired for poor performance in conducting DNA tests. The defense filed a public disclosure request and obtained a lengthy report from the Washington State Patrol (WSP) detailing years of Ms. Olson\u2019s incompetence and \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d CP at 237-60. The February 2011 report, written by Larry Hebert, the director of the WSP\u2019s Laboratory Services Bureau, explained that after numerous errors performing DNA tests, Ms. Olson was given a final opportunity to improve her performance under a 90-day job improvement plan, supervised by Ms. Heath, which assessed her performance in 15 \u201croutine and straight*163forward\u201d cases \u201cfor the purpose of assessing her competency.\u201d CP at 239.\n\u00b616 Even at a time when Ms. Olson was under close scrutiny, she continued to make major and minor mistakes. Five reviewing scientists reviewed the quality of her work. Ms. Heath summarized Ms. Olson\u2019s incompetence as including \u201ca lack of attention to detail\u201d and making a \u201cnumber of technical mistakes,\u201d and noted \u201cpoor performance and critical work deficiencies prevail despite numerous opportunities to improve.\u201d CP at 239-40.\n\u00b617 The report also summarized findings from an earlier investigation launched in May 2008, which \u201carose out of two years of poor evaluation dating back to 2006 and an error in ... proficiency test.\u201d CP at 255. The 2008 audit reviewed 27 of Ms. Olson\u2019s cases, of which only 6 did not have errors. This resulted in \u201cBrady letters\u201d being sent to 11 prosecuting attorneys notifying them of Ms. Olson\u2019s faulty testing. CP at 256. The report documented the following problems: (1) mathematical errors resulting in the amplification of more DNA than intended, (2) diluting the wrong sample, contaminating one sample with a nonadjacent sample, and mixing samples, (3) listing the wrong victims, suspects, and case names, (4) incorrectly concluding a suspect\u2019s DNA was included in a mixed sample, and (5) other incorrect conclusions. One reviewer noted that Ms. Olson \u201cviolated analytical protocol by processing reference samples prior to evidence samples [thereby] increasing risk of contamination.\u201d CP at 255.\n\u00b618 The report concluded \u201c[Ms. Olson] is a loose cannon and her work cannot be trusted. The work product of the Crime Laboratory Division is too vital to the administration of justice to allow [Ms. Olson] to place her hands on evidence. The risk of a wrongful conviction or the erroneous exclusion of a guilty subject because of [Ms. Olson\u2019s] incompetence is far too great for the agency to undertake.\u201d CP at 259.\n*164\u00b619 After receiving the report, Mr. Davila moved for a new trial based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence. Defense counsel pointed out that Ms. Heath had never mentioned Ms. Olson when he asked her about the crime lab\u2019s testing procedures and safeguards. He argued that the State had an obligation to disclose the information about Ms. Olson because \u201cshe handled all of the DNA evidence in this case. It was in her possession, she maintained it, she tested it.\u201d RP at 576-77. Defense counsel also argued that the failure to disclose the information deprived him of the opportunity to challenge the DNA evidence and the possibility of improper handling: \u201cI believe saying that Ms. Heath touched this evidence, looked at it, it all looked fine, that doesn\u2019t exclude the fact that it could have been contaminated in some way because of Ms. Olson\u2019s poor performance in the past prior to Ms. Heath touching it.\u201d RP at 577. The prosecutor responded that he had not been aware of the WSP report and that it was Ms. Heath, not Ms. Olson, who had conducted all the DNA testing in Mr. Davila\u2019s case.\n\u00b620 The trial court was not particularly concerned about the contents of the performance report, noting that it focused \u201cmore on things like not writing the report very well, and also taking too long and using more of the resources of the crime lab tha[n] really ought to be used.\u201d RP at 595. The court gave defense counsel time to contact a DNA expert to determine whether there was any basis for concern about the DNA testing.\n\u00b621 Defense counsel contacted Dr. Gregory Hampikian, a DNA expert with a PhD in genetics. Dr. Hampikian reviewed the WSP investigative file and noted, \u201cMost troubling are the multiple instances where [Ms. Olson] deviated from protocol without reason, and specifically one documented case where she switched samples after careless labeling.\u201d CP at 310. After summarizing Ms. Olson\u2019s multiple \u201ctechnical and scientific failures\u201d during 2006 and 2007, he concluded the errors \u201cdemonstrate a clear pattern *165of incompetence that [the] report characterizes as damaging to the laboratory\u2019s reputation and the public trust.\u201d CP at 310. Dr. Hampikian noted that Ms. Olson performed critical DNA tests and had access to the key DNA samples used to implicate Mr. Davila. He stated, \u201cWith her well-documented propensity for errors, her work in this case is suspect.\u201d CP at 310 (emphasis added). He continued,\nWhile I can not determine if. .. Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA was in the laboratory at the same time (or before) the evidence samples in this case, it is clear that two evidence samples in this case (the sample taken from the car, and that from the bat) were handled and processed by Ms. Olsen [sic]. If the car sample actually had Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA, it is possible that Ms. Olsen mislabeled or contaminated the samples, so that her finding of Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA on the bat is incorrect. This . . . concern is based on her well-documented, long term deficiencies, and the specific mislabeling of samples described in her performance records.\nCP at 310-11.\n\u00b622 The trial court denied Mr. Davila\u2019s motion for a new trial, finding that the existence of other crime scene items with the baseball bat in the lab did not mean they \u201cwere in proximity at a time and a place where contamination could have occurred.\u201d RP at 619. The court pointed out that the testing of the DNA from the steering wheel and the baseball bat had been conducted on different days and, therefore, there was no risk of contamination. It stated:\nWe do know that Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA was not in the lab directly from any prior conviction or prior matter, so the test sample for him came in later. Ms. Heath has provided not only her certificate of where she tested the materials, but also the reports that these materials were not tested together. They were tested on separate days.\nThe first thing that was tested was the bat, and it is the bat that has the DNA. The steering wheel ended up being inconclusive as to whether or not Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA was even on it. So that was inclusive; it has never been identified specifically as an item that had his DNA.\n*166RP at 623. The court ultimately concluded that the risk of contamination was purely speculative and, therefore, Ms. Olson\u2019s history of incompetence was not material to Mr. Davila\u2019s case. Mr. Davila appeals.\nANALYSIS\nI. Brady Violation\n\u00b623 Mr. Davila first asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the State failed to disclose favorable evidence in violation of Brady, 373 U.S. 83. An asserted Brady violation, which implicates due process concerns, is reviewed de novo. State v. Autrey, 136 Wn. App. 460, 467, 150 P.3d 580 (2006).\n \u00b624 The prosecution has an affirmative duty to disclose evidence favorable to a defendant. Brady, 373 U.S. at 87; Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 432, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995). In Brady, the United States Supreme Court held \u201cthat the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. The prosecutor\u2019s good or bad faith is unimportant. Significantly in this case, \u201ca prosecutor has the duty to learn of evidence favorable to the defendant that is known to others acting on behalf of the government in a particular case, including the police.\u201d In re Pers. Restraint of Brennan, 117 Wn. App. 797, 804, 72 P.3d 182 (2003) (citing Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437). The purpose of holding police and those helping police accountable is that \u201c '[e]xculpatory evidence cannot be kept out of the hands of the defense just because the prosecutor does not have it.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 804-05 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Zuno-Arce, 44 F.3d 1420, 1427 (9th Cir. 1995)). Without this rule, \u201cprosecutors could instruct those assisting them not to give the prosecutor certain types of information, resulting in police and other investigating agencies acting as the final arbiters of justice.\u201d Id. at 805.\n*167\u00b625 Before there is a constitutional violation under Brady, three elements must be satisfied: (1) the State failed to disclose evidence that is favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or impeaching, (2) the evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently, and (3) the undisclosed evidence was prejudicial. State v. Mullen, 171 Wn.2d 881, 895, 259 P.3d 158 (2011) (quoting Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1999)). In analyzing these factors, we are mindful that the fundamental purpose of Brady is the preservation of a fair trial. Id. (quoting Morris v. Ylst, 447 F.3d 735, 742 (9th Cir. 2006)).\n\u00b626 A. Favorable to the Accused. The prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose impeachment evidence is well established. \u201c \u2018Favorable evidence includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful to impeach the credibility of a government witness.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Jackson, 345 F.3d 59, 70 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2001)). Mr. Davila contends the withheld information was significant impeachment evidence that would have substantially benefitted his defense. He argues, \u201c[d]ue to the prospect of contamination or false results, Ms. Olson\u2019s conduct would have been pertinent, favorable evidence that should have been disclosed.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 21. He contends that had he known about the WSP report detailing Ms. Olson\u2019s incompetence, he could have impeached Ms. Heath\u2019s assertions about the lab\u2019s careful attention to protocol and proficiency testing.\n\u00b627 The State, however, asks us to measure the value of the potential impeachment evidence based on Mr. Davila\u2019s failure to call Ms. Olson as a witness and argues that \u201c[t]he fact that Ms. Olson\u2019s work did not identify Mr. Davila as being at the scene of the murder worked to Mr. Davila\u2019s advantage, so he would have no reason to impeach her work.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 7.\n\u00b628 The State\u2019s argument overlooks the fact that Mr. Davila had no reason to believe Ms. Olson was a significant *168witness until he learned of her incompetence and resulting termination from the crime lab. At the time of trial, the defense did not know that Ms. Olson had lost her job due to repeated instances of failing to follow laboratory protocol. It did not know that she had contaminated DNA samples. If this information had been disclosed, defense counsel could have used the information to cross-examine Ms. Heath about the reliability of the DNA testing and undermine the professionalism of the State\u2019s forensic witnesses. Our Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of this cross-examination, noting, \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has recognized the potential value in cross-examining forensic analysts.\u201d In re Pers. Restraint of Stenson, 174 Wn.2d 474, 489, 276 P.3d 286, cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 444 (2012).\n\u00b629 Due to the prospect of contamination or false results, Ms. Olson\u2019s extensive history of poor performance and incompetence would have been favorable evidence that should have been disclosed. This evidence would have opened an area of impeachment that Mr. Davila was unaware of at the time of trial. As such, it constitutes evidence that was favorable to him on the issue of guilt.\n \u00b630 B. Evidence Was Suppressed. We next address whether the State failed to disclose the favorable evidence, rendering it \u201csuppressed\u201d under Brady. Benn v. Lambert, 283 F.3d 1040, 1053 (9th Cir. 2002) (the terms \u201csuppression\u201d and \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d have the same meaning for Brady purposes). Mr. Davila contends that knowledge of the WSP report should be imputed to the prosecution because the information was known to the WSP as authors of the report and to Ms. Heath, Ms. Olson\u2019s direct supervisor. As explained above, under Brady, due process requires the State to disclose to the defendant any evidence in its possession that is favorable to the defendant, regardless of the good faith or bad faith of the State. Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. \u201c[A]n inadvertent nondisclosure has the same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment.\u201d Strickler, 527 U.S. at 288. As such, the State \u201chas a duty to *169learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case\u201d and disclose that information to the defendant. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s lack of awareness of exculpatory evidence in the government\u2019s hands is not determinative of the prosecutor\u2019s disclosure obligations. Rather, Brady requires disclosure of information in the government\u2019s possession or knowledge, whether actual or constructive. United States v. Beers, 189 F.3d 1297, 1304 (10th Cir. 1999); Brennan, 117 Wn. App. at 804. Because the prosecution is in a unique position to obtain information known to other investigating agents of the government, it may not be excused from disclosing what it does not know but could have learned. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 438-40; Carriger v. Stewart, 132 F.3d 463, 480 (9th Cir. 1997). Thus, a prosecutor\u2019s duty to learn of favorable evidence has been interpreted broadly because of a \u201cspecial status\u201d within the American criminal justice system. Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281. \u201cThe disclosure obligation exists . . . not to police the good faith of prosecutors, but to ensure the accuracy and fairness of trials by requiring the adversarial testing of all available evidence bearing on guilt or innocence.\u201d Carriger, 132 F.3d at 480.\n\u00b631 With these principles in mind, we determine that the prosecution was in constructive possession of the WSP report and Ms. Olson\u2019s history of incompetence. An audit conducted close in time to the Davis prosecution resulted in Brady letters being sent to 11 prosecuting attorneys notifying them of Ms. Olson\u2019s problems and the potential impact on their cases. Moreover, the information was known to the WSP, which supports criminal investigations by gathering evidence for law enforcement agencies. State v. Gregory, 158 Wn.2d 759, 829 n.37, 147 P.3d 1201 (2006). The WSP crime lab\u2019s director wrote the report, which was issued more than one year before Mr. Davila\u2019s trial, and Ms. Heath, who was Ms. Olson\u2019s immediate supervisor, devised Ms. Olson\u2019s job improvement plan. Given that Ms. Heath was acting on behalf of the State as *170a primary witness at trial, her knowledge of the WSP report must be imputed to the prosecutor. The State cannot avoid Brady \u201cby keeping itself in ignorance, or compartmentalizing information about different aspects of a case.\u201d Carey v. Duckworth, 738 F.2d 875, 878 (7th Cir. 1984). In fact, a \u201c \u2018prosecutor may have a duty to search files maintained by other governmental agencies closely aligned with the prosecution when there is some reasonable prospect or notice of finding exculpatory evidence.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Harmon, 871 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1154 (D.N.M. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Padilla, No. CR 09-3598 JB, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31091 (D.N.M. Mar. 14, 2011)), aff\u2019d, 742 F.3d 451 (10th Cir. 2014).\n\u00b632 We conclude that the prosecutor had constructive possession of the information and, therefore, wrongfully suppressed it.\n\u00b633 C. Materiality. The remaining and most significant issue is whether the WSP report was material, i.e., whether its nondisclosure prejudiced Mr. Davila. As detailed above, the trial court denied the motion for a new trial, concluding the report was not material to Mr. Davila\u2019s case without some evidence that the DNA sample had been contaminated. It dismissed the defense\u2019s concerns of contamination as speculative, pointing out that the two key pieces of evidence\u2014the steering wheel and the baseball bat\u2014were tested on different days.\n\u00b634 Mr. Davila contends the State\u2019s failure to disclose the report undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial because he was not able to conduct meaningful cross-examination of Ms. Heath and thereby challenge the critical DNA evidence. He maintains, \u201cHad the jury known that the swabs taken from the bat\u2019s handle, which formed the only potentially direct connection between the incident in which Mr. Allen was killed and Mr. Davila, had been handled, processed, and tested by a forensic scientist whose work \u2018cannot be trusted\u2019 due to her \u2018long term poor performance,\u2019 the jury would have thought differently about the value of the DNA evidence.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 28.\n*171\u00b635 Prejudice, also referred to as \u201cmateriality,\u201d is established when there is a reasonable probability that had the prosecution disclosed the evidence to the defense, the proceeding would have had a different result. State v. Thomas, 150 Wn.2d 821, 850, 83 P.3d 970 (2004) (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985)); Kyles, 514 U.S. at 433. The Kyles Court elaborated:\n[A] showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal.... The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result is accordingly shown when the government\u2019s evidentiary suppression \u201cundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nKyles, 514 U.S. at 434 (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678).\n\u00b636 Thus, materiality is not a sufficiency of the evidence test. Id. A defendant does not lose on a Brady claim where there still would have been adequate evidence to convict even if the favorable evidence at issue had been disclosed. Id. at 435. In assessing the materiality of undisclosed evidence, a court must consider \u201cany adverse effect that the prosecutor\u2019s failure [to disclose the evidence] might have had on the preparation or presentation of the defendant\u2019s case . . . with an awareness of the difficulty of reconstructing in a post-trial proceeding the course that the defense and the trial would have taken\u201d had the information been disclosed to the defense. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 683.\n\u00b637 We start our analysis by noting that the DNA evidence was the crux of the State\u2019s case and that Ms. Olson was the critical link in the chain who handled the DNA swabs and performed the initial testing. Disclosure of the report would have led to additional investigation that could have been vital to the defense. In challenging the DNA *172evidence, the defense could have called Dr. Hampikian, who, according to defense counsel, had concerns about the fact that two days before the baseball bat was tested, swabs from Mr. Allen\u2019s truck and the steering wheel were in the lab, raising the possibility of contamination of the evidence. Dr. Hampikian expressed serious concerns about Ms. Olson\u2019s access to the DNA samples and found her work in the case \u201csuspect.\u201d CP at 310. He could have explained the importance of following DNA protocols and the risk of contamination presented by Ms. Olson\u2019s conduct.\n\u00b638 In view of the foregoing, the fundamental question is whether there is a reasonable probability that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have led to a different result, i.e., whether in the absence of disclosure, Mr. Davila received a fair trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. The omission is evaluated in the context of the entire record. United State v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 112-13, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976). While Ms. Olson\u2019s incompetence is undisputed, close review of the record establishes little likelihood that her handling of the evidence could have contaminated the evidence at issue. As detailed above, the State carefully established the chain of custody and the care taken by each person in that chain to secure uncontaminated DNA samples. Each person in that chain testified about his or her role in the process. Detective Cestnik testified that he wore gloves when he placed the baseball bat on the shelf in Mr. Allen\u2019s store. Detective Madsen removed the baseball bat from Mr. Allen\u2019s store, and Ms. Preuninger swabbed the bat. Ms. Preuninger detailed the precautions she utilized to prevent contamination. Detective Madsen personally submitted the swabs to the WSP crime lab, where they were placed in sealed envelopes and then stored in the property room. Ms. Olson\u2019s reports show that she tested the DNA swabs from the steering wheel and the baseball bat on separate days, astronomically reducing the possibility of cross contamination.\n*173\u00b639 Admittedly, Ms. Olson\u2019s incompetence raises general concerns about the adequacy of the DNA testing. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that Ms. Olson tampered with or mishandled the evidence in this particular case. At most, Mr. Davila has established that Ms. Olson was fired from her job for incompetence related to other testing, but nothing in the record shows that her incompetence compromised the evidence at issue here. Ms. Heath peer reviewed Ms. Olson\u2019s work and found no evidence of protocol violations. While evidence of Ms. Olson\u2019s incompetence could have been used for impeachment purposes, it was not material to the accuracy of Ms. Olson\u2019s work in this case. Based on the paucity of evidence that contamination actually occurred in this case, we conclude that the defendant received a fair trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. Therefore, the State\u2019s suppression of the WSP performance report did not violate Brady.\nII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\u00b640 Finally, Mr. Davila contends that the prosecution engaged in misconduct by using inconsistent theories of criminal culpability: arguing at Mr. Davis\u2019s trial that Mr. Davis \u201chit [ ] Mr. Allen over the head with the baseball bat\u201d but at the subsequent trial that Mr. Davila was the person who killed Mr. Allen with the baseball bat. CP at 76. He argues, \u201c[B]oth men could not be guilty of being the person who killed Mr. Allen. . . . Either Mr. Davis hit Mr. Allen on the head, as the State argued at Mr. Davis\u2019s trial, or Mr. Davila did so, but there was no evidence that both did so together.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 35.\n \u00b641 A defendant claiming prosecutorial misconduct bears the burden of establishing that the challenged conduct was both improper and prejudicial. State v. Cheatam, 150 Wn.2d 626, 652, 81 P.3d 830 (2003). Once a defendant establishes that a prosecutor\u2019s statements are improper, this court determines whether the defendant was prejudiced under one of two standards of review. State v. *174Emery, 174 Wn.2d 741, 760, 278 P.3d 653 (2012). If the defendant objected at trial, he must show that the misconduct resulted in prejudice that had a substantial likelihood of affecting the jury\u2019s verdict. Id. If the defendant did not object, he is deemed to have waived any error unless the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was so flagrant and ill intentioned that an instruction could not have cured the resulting prejudice. Id. at 760-61.\n\u00b642 The use of inconsistent theories to obtain convictions against separate defendants in prosecutions for the same crime violates the due process clause if the prosecutor uses false evidence or acts in bad faith. Loi Van Nguyen v. Lindsey, 232 F.3d 1236, 1240 (9th Cir. 2000); Thompson v. Calderon, 120 F.3d 1045, 1058 (9th Cir. 1997), vacated on other grounds, 523 U.S. 538, 118 S. Ct. 1489, 140 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1998). However, inconsistent theories are permitted if, between the two trials, new evidence comes to light that supports the second theory. See Thompson, 120 F.3d at 1058.\n\u00b643 In denying Mr. Davila\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the prosecutor\u2019s use of inconsistent theories, the trial court first noted that both parties mentioned Mr. Davis\u2019s conviction at trial:\nIt was clear from day one on this trial that the jury was going to hear information about Mr. Davis and that Mr. Davis had been convicted of the murder. That issue came up specifically via motion that the defense made early on to call Mr. Nagy [the prosecutor in the Davis trial] as a witness. I denied that motion. We were aware, and I know I said something to that effect, that the jury was going to be hearing about Mr. Davis. They certainly did hear about Mr. Davis from both sides. The fact that Mr. Davis was convicted is a fact in this case and it is a fact that was given to the jury. Not discussing it would have appeared odd to the jurors since it was the subject of closing on both sides, the defense as well as the state. I do not believe that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were inappropriate.\nRP at 589-90.\n*175\u00b644 The court also noted that new evidence surfaced after the Davis trial and that the State\u2019s theories at the two trials were not inconsistent:\nAt the time that Mr. Davis was tried, there was an identification of another individual referred to as unknown individual A, who had DNA on the baseball bat. There was no match to Mr. Davila at the time. The jury in the Davis case was aware of that fact and it was mentioned in the closing argument.\nWhen we come to this case, really the theory of this case is no different than the theory in the Davis case. Mr. Allen was killed by a baseball bat, that remained the same. There was unknown individual A\u2019s DNA on the baseball bat .... Those issues did not change.\n. . . This is not a situation where the theory in this case has been changed. There is additional information that was available in the Davila case that was not available in the Davis case, i.e. now the unknown individual A is Mr. Davila.\nRP at 590-92.\n\u00b645 In closing, the State argued, \u201cYou heard a lot about Mr. Jeramie Davis. Mr. Davis isn\u2019t what we\u2019re here about. You\u2019re here about Mr. Davila. Mr. Davis has already been convicted for what he did on that day. We\u2019re not here to reconvict Mr. Davis all over again. His case is done.\u201d RP at 543. The prosecutor then noted that the State did not have Mr. Davila\u2019s DNA in the system when the murder was first investigated, but \u201cnow we know who swung the bat; Julio Davila swung the bat.\u201d RP at 543.\n\u00b646 The State\u2019s theories were not inconsistent. The State always maintained that Mr. Allen was killed with the baseball bat. As to who held the bat, it is true that the prosecutor made different arguments at each trial, but his argument at the second trial was consistent with the new evidence that came to light after the first trial. Nguyen, 232 F.3d at 1240. This is not prosecutorial misconduct.\n\u00b647 Mr. Davila fails to establish prosecutorial misconduct. In the absence of a finding of prosecutorial mis*176conduct, Mr. Davila\u2019s cumulative error argument likewise fails. State v. Weber, 159 Wn.2d 252, 279, 149 P.3d 646 (2006).\n\u00b648 We affirm.\nSiddoway, C.J., and Brown, J., concur.\nReview granted at 182 Wn.2d 1002 (2015).\n\n Deoxyribonucleic acid.\n\n\n Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963).\n\n\n The Spokane County Superior Court vacated Mr. Davis\u2019s murder conviction on September 20, 2012, in case number 07-1-02548-8 after Mr. Davila was convicted of Mr. Allen\u2019s murder.\n\n",
