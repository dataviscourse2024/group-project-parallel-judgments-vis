Two years later, a jury convicted him of theft\n\nin an amount less than $1,500, with two prior theft convictions, see Act of May 29,\n\n2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 1234, \u00a7 21, 2011 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. 3309, 3310 (amended\n\n2015, 2017) (current version at Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.03,1 and the trial court\n\nsentenced him to two years\u2019 confinement in state jail. See Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\n\u00a7 12.35 (providing that state jail felony punishment range is not more than two years\n\nor less than 180 days and up to a $10,000 fine).\n\n      In a single point, Bell complains that the trial court erred by admitting two\n\nadditional, non-jurisdictional extraneous prior theft convictions during the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase of his trial. Bell argues that these convictions were not admissible\n\nunder rule of evidence 404(b)2 to show intent because he never raised lack of intent as\n\n\n      1\n         Former penal code section 31.03(e)(4)(D) provided that an offense was a state\njail felony if the value of the stolen property was less than $1,500 and the defendant\nhad been previously convicted two or more times of any grade of theft. Act of May\n29, 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 1234, \u00a7 21, 2011 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. at 3310 (amended\n2015, 2017). Bell stipulated to the jurisdictional prior theft convictions listed in the\nindictment.\n      2\n       Rule of evidence 404(b) states, in pertinent part, that evidence of a crime is not\nadmissible to prove the conformity of a person\u2019s character therewith but \u201cmay be\nadmissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent,\n\n                                           2\n\fa defensive theory and that, contrary to rule of evidence 403\u2019s balancing test,3 they \u201cat\n\nbest[] marginally added to already voluminous evidence of intent.\u201d\n\n      Assuming, without deciding, that the trial court erred by admitting the two\n\nextraneous theft convictions, we conclude that on this record, any such error was\n\nharmless. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).4\n\n      The jury heard from two Wal-Mart asset-protection employees and the\n\narresting police officer, among others, and viewed the store\u2019s surveillance footage\n\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d Tex.\nR. Evid. 404(b).\n      3\n       Rule of evidence 403 states that a court may exclude relevant evidence if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the\nfollowing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, or\nneedlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Tex. R. Evid. 403.\n      4\n        Generally, the erroneous admission of evidence is nonconstitutional error\ngoverned by rule 44.2(b) if the trial court\u2019s ruling merely offends the rules of evidence.\nSee Solomon v. State, 49 S.W.3d 356, 365 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Under rule of\nappellate procedure 44.2(b), we disregard the error if it did not affect the appellant\u2019s\nsubstantial rights. Id.; see Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 259 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998)\n(op. on reh\u2019g). A substantial right is affected when the error had a substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict. King v. State, 953 S.W.2d\n266, 271 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (citing Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66\nS. Ct. 1239, 1253 (1946)). Conversely, an error does not affect a substantial right if we\nhave \u201cfair assurance that the error did not influence the jury, or had but a slight\neffect.\u201d Solomon, 49 S.W.3d at 365; Johnson v. State, 967 S.W.2d 410, 417 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1998). In making this determination, we review the record as a whole, including\nany testimony or physical evidence admitted for the jury\u2019s consideration, the nature of\nthe evidence supporting the verdict, and the character of the alleged error and how it\nmight be considered in connection with other evidence in the case. Motilla v. State, 78\nS.W.3d 352, 355 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). We may also consider the jury instructions,\nthe State\u2019s theory and any defensive theories, whether the State emphasized the error,\nclosing arguments, and even voir dire, if applicable. Id. at 355\u201356.\n\n\n                                            3\n\fshowing Bell\u2019s progress through the store from entry to exit except for the act of\n\nconcealment, which occurred in the menswear department. One of the Wal-Mart\n\nemployees testified that he saw Bell walk through the menswear department\u2014an area\n\nfrequented by shoplifters because of its lack of surveillance cameras near the changing\n\nrooms\u2014with a cart full of steaks worth $156.33 and then pull out two empty Wal-\n\nMart bags, put the steaks in the bags, and place the bags back in the cart. Bell next\n\nheaded to the front of the store, but when he arrived in the cash register area\u2014an\n\nopportunity to pay for the merchandise\u2014he removed both bags, ditched the cart, and\n\nwalked to the other side of the store. Bell then crossed the \u201clast point of sale,\u201d i.e.,\n\nthe first set of doors, with the bags of steaks. No one from Wal-Mart gave Bell\n\nconsent to leave the store without paying for the steaks.\n\n      When Wal-Mart\u2019s asset-protection employees attempted to approach Bell in the\n\nvestibule area between the first and second set of the store\u2019s doors, he dropped the\n\nbags, told them that he had not done anything, and walked out of the store. One of\n\nthe employees called the police while the other kept his eyes on Bell from the parking\n\nlot. A nearby patrol officer responded to the call, identified Bell based on the\n\ndescription of his clothing, stopped him, and asked him what happened at Wal-Mart.\n\nBell told her that he had \u201cmessed up\u201d and that he had taken some steaks because he\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fneeded the money and was going to sell them.5 Bell was arrested and transported to\n\njail; when he was searched at the jail, police found a single penny on him and no other\n\nmeans to pay for the steaks. Only after all of the above evidence was admitted did the\n\nprosecutor seek and receive permission to use two of Bell\u2019s prior theft convictions\n\nunder rule of evidence 404(b), arguing that Bell had put his intent into issue by trying\n\nto show that he did not have the intent to deprive Wal-Mart of the steaks based on his\n\ndropping the bags before he left the store.\n\n       The overwhelming evidence of Bell\u2019s guilt set out above, the lack of any\n\ndemonstrable prosecutorial misbehavior during voir dire or trial,6 and the extraneous-\n\noffense limiting instruction in the jury charge lead us to conclude that any error in the\n\nadmission of the two extraneous offenses had no substantial or injurious effect on the\n\njury\u2019s verdict and could not have affected Bell\u2019s substantial rights. See King, 953\n\nS.W.2d at 271. Thus, we disregard the error, see Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b), overrule\n\nBell\u2019s single point, and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n       5\n        The trial court denied Bell\u2019s motion to suppress his statements made to the\nofficer after he told her that he messed up. Bell does not appeal the denial of his\nmotion to suppress.\n       6\n        The prosecutor argued during closing arguments that the evidence showed\nbeyond all doubt\u2014based on 90% of the offense having been caught on videotape and\nBell\u2019s admission of guilt to the officer\u2014that Bell had stolen steaks from Wal-Mart by\nexercising control over them in the store, taking them past the cash registers without\npaying, and taking them into the store\u2019s vestibule without the consent of store\nemployees. The prosecutor mentioned the extraneous offenses during the first part\nof his closing argument, but he spent more time emphasizing the evidence that was\ndirectly related to the instant offense.\n\n                                              5\n\f                                  /s/ Mark Pittman\n                                  Mark Pittman\n                                  Justice\n\nDo Not Publish\nTex.
