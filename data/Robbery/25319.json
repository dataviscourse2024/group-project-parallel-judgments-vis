            "opinion_text": "        SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK\n           Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial Department\n\n848\nKA 13-01277\nPRESENT: SCUDDER, P.J., CARNI, LINDLEY, VALENTINO, AND WHALEN, JJ.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, RESPONDENT,\n\n                    V                              MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n\nDEVAUHN DONALDSON, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\n\nTHE LEGAL AID BUREAU OF BUFFALO, INC., BUFFALO (KAREN C.\nRUSSO-MCLAUGHLIN OF COUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\nFRANK A. SEDITA, III, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BUFFALO (DONNA A. MILLING OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n     Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Erie County (M.\nWilliam Boller, A.J.), rendered May 24, 2013. The judgment convicted\ndefendant, upon his plea of guilty, of attempted robbery in the second\ndegree.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is\nunanimously affirmed.\n\n     Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him\nupon his plea of guilty of attempted robbery in the second degree\n(Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 160.10 [2] [b]). We agree with defendant that\nhis waiver of the right to appeal does not encompass his challenge to\nthe severity of the sentence inasmuch as Supreme Court did not explain\nduring the course of the allocution concerning the waiver of the right\nto appeal that he was waiving the right to appeal any issue regarding\nthe severity of the sentence (see People v Maracle, 19 NY3d 925, 928;\nPeople v Peterson, 111 AD3d 1412, 1412). Furthermore, although the\nwritten waiver of the right to appeal specifically encompassed any\nchallenge to the sentence, the written waiver does not foreclose our\nreview of the severity of the sentence because \u201c[t]he court did not\ninquire of defendant whether he understood the written waiver or\nwhether he had even read the waiver before signing it\u201d (People v\nBradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 262; see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d 501, 510). We\nnevertheless conclude that the enhanced sentence is not unduly harsh\nor severe. Although the court advised defendant at the time of the\nplea that it would sentence him to a split sentence of local\nincarceration and probation, that commitment was predicated on\ndefendant\u2019s compliance with the conditions that, inter alia, he\ncooperate with and be truthful during his presentence interview with\nthe Probation Department and that he appear at all court appearances,\n\f                                 -2-                           848\n                                                         KA 13-01277\n\nand defendant failed to comply with those conditions.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   July 2, 2015                         Frances E. Cafarell\n                                                Clerk of the Court\n\f",
