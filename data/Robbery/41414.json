The trial judge listed three bases for deviating from the guidelines sentence range of two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half years\u2019 imprisonment. Because all three reasons are invalid, we rev.erse.\nThe first ground, that the defendant violated his probation, cannot support the trial judge\u2019s seven-cell departure where the general rule provides for a one-cell increase for probation violation. See Ehrenshaft v. State, 478 So.2d 842 (Fla. 5th DCA 1985), rev. denied, 488 So.2d 831 (Fla.1986).\nThe second ground, economic hardship on the victims, is not a permissible reason for departure from the presumptive sentence. Hankey v. State, 485 So.2d 827 (Fla.1986).\nFinally, the third ground for departure cannot be sustained where the trial court\u2019s assessment that the defendant committed the burglary \u201cin a particularly professional manner\u201d is not supported by the record. See Mullen v. State, 483 So.2d 754 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986).\nFor the above-stated reasons, the sentence is reversed and the case remanded for resentencing in accordance with the sentencing guidelines.\nReversed and remanded.\n",
