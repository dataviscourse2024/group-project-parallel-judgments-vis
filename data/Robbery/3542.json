The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect this status.\nThis is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal.\nRespondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted in part. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir.2000); Aragon-Ayon v. INS, 206 F.3d 847, 849-50 (9th Cir.2000); see also 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) &amp; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); cf. United States v. Espinoza-Cano, 456 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.2006) (applying modified categorical approach to California theft statue that criminalizes more than the taking of property).\nRespondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted in part because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. See United States v. Hooton, 693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).\nAll other pending motions are denied as moot.\nPETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.\n\n",
