Rickie Foy was among a group of in\u2010\ndividuals whose attempt to forcibly break into a Chicago\nATM during summer daylight hours was recorded by the ma\u2010\nchine\u2019s security camera. After Foy\u2019s arrest, federal charges\nwere brought against him, and he was found guilty of con\u2010\nspiracy to commit bank theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371\nand 2113(b). On appeal, Foy raises three issues: first, that the\ngovernment was required to show evidence of intent to steal\n\f2                                                            No. 21\u20102753\n\nmore than $1,000, rather than just intent to steal; second, that\nthe government fell short of establishing a conspiracy at trial;\nand third, that the district court impermissibly considered the\ncivil unrest in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death as an aggra\u2010\nvating factor in sentencing Foy. For the following reasons, we\na\ufb03rm Foy\u2019s conviction and sentence.\n\n                          I.    Background\n\n    A. Factual Background\n    On June 1, 2020, a group of individuals attempted to steal\nmoney from a Bank of America ATM located in an ALDI gro\u2010\ncery store parking lot in Chicago, Illinois. The ATM was\nequipped with a surveillance video camera which captured\nvideo, but not audio, from the scene. The footage shows a\ngroup of people\u2014including Foy (clad in a neon construction\nvest) and his co\u2010defendants Pierre Harvey and Chyenne\nSimpson\u2014surrounding the ATM at approximately 7:10 PM.1\nFor roughly the next eight minutes, the group used an assort\u2010\nment of tools, including a hammer, crowbar, and rod, to at\u2010\ntempt to break open the ATM and access its contents. The in\u2010\ndividuals passed these tools among the assembled group, ap\u2010\npearing to direct one another on how to utilize them. The\ngroup damaged the outside cover of the ATM but ultimately\nfailed to gain access to the cash inside.\n   At approximately 7:18 PM, Chicago Police Department\n(\u201cCPD\u201d) officers arrived on the scene and arrested Foy, Har\u2010\nvey, and Simpson. According to Bank of America records, the\n\n\n    1 At trial, the parties stipulated that the video timestamps incorrectly\nreflect one hour earlier than the actual time of the incident.\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                  3\n\nvandalized ATM held over $190,000 in cash. The FDIC in\u2010\nsured Bank of America at the time of the incident.\n   B. Procedural Background\n    In June 2020, a criminal complaint charged Foy with vio\u2010\nlating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 by conspiring to commit an offense\nagainst the United States, specifically bank theft in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b). Section 371\u2014the conspiracy count\u2014\nprovides that:\n       If two or more persons conspire either to com\u2010\n       mit any offense against the United States, or to\n       defraud the United States, or any agency thereof\n       in any manner or for any purpose, and one or\n       more of such persons do any act to effect the ob\u2010\n       ject of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under\n       this title or imprisoned not more than five years,\n       or both.\n       If, however, the offense, the commission of\n       which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misde\u2010\n       meanor only, the punishment for such conspir\u2010\n       acy shall not exceed the maximum punishment\n       provided for such misdemeanor.\n    Section 2113(b)\u2014the federal bank robbery statute\u2014\nstates that:\n       Whoever takes and carries away, with intent to\n       steal or purloin, any property or money or any\n       other thing of value exceeding $1,000 belonging\n       to, or in the care, custody, control, management,\n       or possession of any bank, credit union, or any\n       savings and loan association, shall be fined\n\f4                                                  No. 21\u20102753\n\n       under this title or imprisoned not more than ten\n       years, or both; or\n       Whoever takes and carries away, with intent to\n       steal or purloin, any property or money or any\n       other thing of value not exceeding $1,000 be\u2010\n       longing to, or in the care, custody, control, man\u2010\n       agement, or possession of any bank, credit un\u2010\n       ion, or any savings and loan association, shall be\n       fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n       than one year, or both.\n    A grand jury returned a single\u2010count indictment on June\n17, 2020, charging Foy with conspiring \u201cto commit an offense\nagainst the United States, namely, to take and carry away\nwith the intent to steal money exceeding $1,000 in value be\u2010\nlonging to \u2026 Bank of America\u201d in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 371 and\n2113(b). Foy pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on June 23,\n2020, and he remained in federal custody through his trial.\n    In December 2020, Foy waived his right to a jury trial and\nopted to resolve his case by bench trial. Both parties consented\nto conducting the trial remotely via videoconference, which\nwas held on February 10, 2021. At the trial, which lasted less\nthan three hours, the government played the ATM\u2019s surveil\u2010\nlance video. Foy moved for judgment of acquittal at the close\nof the government\u2019s case, arguing that, even taking the evi\u2010\ndence in the light most favorable to the government, specula\u2010\ntion and guessing were required to determine what was tak\u2010\ning place in the silent video footage.\n   The district court found Foy guilty on February 16, 2021,\ndenying his motion for acquittal. Foy moved for a new trial\non March 8, 2021. His arguments included that the\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                    5\n\ngovernment failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\nhe intended to steal more than $1,000 because \u201cperhaps the\ndefendants, whether acting alone or together would have\nbeen satisfied with, and therefore intended to steal[,] less than\n$1,000,\u201d and that the government failed to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the defendants conspired with each\nother because they were conceivably \u201cindependent actors\nseeking to achieve the same goal at the same time.\u201d The dis\u2010\ntrict court rejected Foy\u2019s intent argument, reasoning that the\nintent to steal money or property, as that language appears in\n\u00a7 2113(b), \u201cis not a specific intent to steal property or money\nexceeding $1,000\u201d and \u201c[t]hus the statute does not require the\ngovernment to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Foy\nhad the specific intent to steal an amount exceeding $1,000, or\nthat he knew how much money was in the ATM.\u201d The district\ncourt also rejected Foy\u2019s association argument, reaffirming\nthat the surveillance footage and still images from the ATM\nshow the defendants working together to tear apart the ma\u2010\nchine, in part \u201cby sharing crowbars and rods.\u201d\n    Prior to the sentencing hearing, Foy objected to the gov\u2010\nernment\u2019s proposed dangerous weapon enhancement and in\u2010\ntended loss calculation included in the Presentence Investiga\u2010\ntion Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Ultimately, the government did not pur\u2010\nsue the dangerous weapon enhancement and the parties\nagreed to an actual loss calculation equivalent to the cost to\nreplace the ATM, which led to a revised range of thirty to\nthirty\u2010seven months\u2019 imprisonment under the Sentencing\nGuidelines. On September 10, 2021, the district court sen\u2010\ntenced Foy to thirty\u2010seven months\u2019 imprisonment, and three\nyears\u2019 supervised release, in addition to restitution. Foy now\nappeals.\n\f6                                                   No. 21\u20102753\n\n                      II.   Discussion\n\n    Addressing Foy\u2019s issues on appeal: first, that the govern\u2010\nment was required to show evidence of intent to steal more\nthan $1,000, rather than just intent to steal generally; second,\nthat the government\u2019s video evidence fell short of establishing\na conspiracy to commit bank theft; and third, that the district\ncourt impermissibly invoked the ongoing civil unrest in June\n2020 as an aggravating factor in his sentencing.\n    As relevant to the first two issues, Foy moved for a judg\u2010\nment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n29, and later for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 33. Under Rule 29, after the close of the govern\u2010\nment\u2019s case, the court must, on a defendant\u2019s motion, \u201center\na judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence\nis insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\nUnder Rule 33, \u201c[u]pon the defendant\u2019s motion, the court may\nvacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\njustice so requires.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a). We review the dis\u2010\ntrict court\u2019s denial of a motion for acquittal under Rule 29 de\nnovo, and the denial of a motion for a new trial under Rule 33\nfor abuse of discretion. United States v. Wilbourn, 799 F.3d 900,\n910 (7th Cir. 2015). As relevant to the final issue, any sentenc\u2010\ning challenges that are forfeited, rather than waived, are re\u2010\nviewed for plain error. United States v. Hyatt, 28 F.4th 776, 782\n(7th Cir. 2022). We address each issue in turn.\n       Required Intent\n   The first issue presents the question of what intent is re\u2010\nquired to satisfy the mens rea element of felony bank theft\nconspiracy: intent to steal or intent to steal more than $1,000.\nFoy argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 33\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                    7\n\nmotion for a new trial in part because it held that the govern\u2010\nment need only show intent to steal. We review this question\nof statutory interpretation de novo. United States v. Miller, 883\nF.3d 998, 1003 (7th Cir. 2018).\n   Beginning with the substantive offense underlying Foy\u2019s\nconspiracy conviction, the federal bank robbery statute distin\u2010\nguishes between property or monetary values above and be\u2010\nlow $1,000:\n       Whoever takes and carries away, with intent to\n       steal or purloin, any property or money or any\n       other thing of value exceeding $1,000 belonging\n       to, or in the care, custody, control, management,\n       or possession of any bank, credit union, or any\n       savings and loan association, shall be fined un\u2010\n       der this title or imprisoned not more than ten\n       years, or both; or\n       Whoever takes and carries away, with intent to\n       steal or purloin, any property or money or any\n       other thing of value not exceeding $1,000 belong\u2010\n       ing to, or in the care, custody, control, manage\u2010\n       ment, or possession of any bank, credit union,\n       or any savings and loan association, shall be\n       fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n       than one year, or both.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b) (emphasis added). Under the $1,000 value\nthreshold, the violation is classified as a misdemeanor. 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(6).\n    There is no dispute that the record is bereft of evidence\nthat Foy specifically intended to steal more than $1,000. In\u2010\nstead, at trial, the government relied on a stipulation that\n\f8                                                   No. 21\u20102753\n\nthere was more than $1,000 in the ATM. Foy argues that the\nintended amount matters: \u201c[I]f the conspiracy was to steal less\nthan $1,000, the intended underlying bank theft would be a\nmisdemeanor, and a felony conspiracy charge could not\nstand.\u201d The government argues that \u00a7 2113(b)\u2019s scienter ele\u2010\nment only requires an intent to steal, while Foy argues that it\nrequires an intent to steal more than $1,000.\n    First, we look to the plain language of the statute. United\nStates v. Sanders, 909 F.3d 895, 901 (7th Cir. 2018). We are un\u2010\nconvinced by Foy\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2113(b) involves \u201ca\nstraightforward, parallel construction\u201d and thus the $1,000\nvaluation modifier \u201capplies to the entire [preceding] series.\u201d\nUnlike other statutes where the relevant modifier has been in\u2010\nterpreted to \u201chang[] together as a unified whole, referring to\na single thing,\u201d Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver Cnty. Emps. Ret. Fund, 138\nS. Ct. 1061, 1077 (2018), \u00a7 2113(b)\u2019s dollar valuation modifier\nis separated from the intent language, which is offset by com\u2010\nmas. Thus, by declining to read the dollar\u2010amount modifier\ninto the intent clause, we are not doing something \u201codd\u201d or\n\u201capply[ing] the modifier \u2026 to only a portion of [a] cohesive\npreceding clause.\u201d Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 141 S. Ct. 1163,\n1169 (2021) (applying a modifier to the entire series where it\nfollowed a \u201cconcise, integrated clause\u201d).\n    Second, and in line with the above textual interpretation,\nthe Supreme Court has analyzed this statute in a different\ncontext and indicated that the dollar\u2010amount modifier stands\nas a separate element. In Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255\n(2000), the Court compared \u00a7 2113(a) and (b). In discussing\nthe statute\u2019s intent requirements, the Court stated that \u201csub\u2010\nsection (b) requires that the defendant act \u2018with intent to steal\nor purloin,\u2019\u201d with no mention of monetary constraints. Id. at\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                      9\n\n262. The Court also clarified that \u201cthe first paragraph of sub\u2010\nsection (b) requires that the property have a \u2018value exceeding\n$1,000,\u2019\u201d with no indication that the specific intent applies to\nthe valuation requirement. Id. (emphasis added). The Su\u2010\npreme Court had every opportunity in Carter to hinge the req\u2010\nuisite intent on the statutory valuation requirement, but it did\nnot do so. In fact, the Court in Carter did the opposite\u2014it rec\u2010\nognized the valuation requirement as its own element. Id. at\n273. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s direction, we need not\nwade into the intricacies of the parties\u2019 linguistic arguments.\n    Third, the pattern jury instructions align with this inter\u2010\npretation. \u201cPattern instructions are presumed to accurately\nstate the law.\u201d United States v. Freed, 921 F.3d 716, 721 (7th Cir.\n2019). For bank theft, the pattern instructions include four\nnecessary elements:\n       1. The defendant took and carried away [prop\u2010\n       erty; money; something of value] belonging to\n       or in the [care; custody; control; management]\n       of [name bank, credit union, or savings and loan\n       named in the indictment]; and\n       2. At the time the defendant took and carried\n       away such [property; money; something of\n       value], the deposits of the [bank; credit union;\n       savings and loan] were insured by the [Federal\n       Deposit Insurance Corporation; Federal Savings\n       and Loan Insurance Corporation; National\n       Credit Union Administration]; and\n       3. The defendant took and carried away such\n       [property; money; thing of value] with the in\u2010\n       tent to steal; and\n\f10                                                    No. 21\u20102753\n\n       4. Such [money; property; thing of value] ex\u2010\n       ceeded $1,000 in value.\nPattern Criminal Jury Instructions of the Seventh Circuit\n(2020) at 749. While the instructions are not dispositive, the\nfact that their presentation of the elements aligns with this\nCourt\u2019s statutory interpretation and the Supreme Court\u2019s\nguidance simply provides additional support.\n    Finally, Foy\u2019s proposed interpretation would lead to im\u2010\npractical and illogical results. Requiring the government to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant specifically\nintended to steal a certain amount of money or that a defend\u2010\nant knew how much money was in an ATM before robbing it\nwould be unworkable. See Molzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301,\n309 (1992) (rejecting proposed interpretation that \u201cwould be\ndifficult and impractical to apply\u201d). Moreover, this Court will\nnot interpret \u00a7 2113(b) to absolve those who rob an ATM but\ndid not have a specific intent regarding the amount of money\nthey intended to steal. See United States v. Nania, 724 F.3d 824,\n837 (7th Cir. 2013) (interpreting Guidelines in a way that\n\u201cavoids a potentially absurd result\u201d).\n    For these reasons, the district court did not err in conclud\u2010\ning the government was only required to show that Foy and\nhis co\u2010conspirators intended to steal money, not that they spe\u2010\ncifically intended to steal more than $1,000. Because we affirm\nthe district court\u2019s interpretation of the \u00a7 2113(b) mens rea re\u2010\nquirements, we need not separately analyze intent under\n\u00a7 371. See United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671, 686 (1975) (\u201c[T]o\nsustain a judgment of conviction on a charge of conspiracy to\nviolate a federal statute, the Government must prove at least\nthe degree of criminal intent necessary for the substantive of\u2010\nfense itself.\u201d); United States v. Zarattini, 552 F.2d 753, 760 (7th\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                     11\n\nCir. 1977) (\u201cThe mental state required for a conspiracy convic\u2010\ntion is no greater than that necessary to commit the underly\u2010\ning substantive offense.\u201d).\n       Evidence of Agreement\n    Foy\u2019s second argument on appeal is that the government\nproduced insufficient evidence to prove the existence of an\nagreement to commit felony bank theft beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. \u201cWe review challenges to the sufficiency of the evi\u2010\ndence in a bench trial under the same deferential standard\nthat applies to a jury verdict: we reverse only if we conclude,\nafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nprosecution, that no rational trier of fact could have found the\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d United States v.\nMedina, 969 F.3d 819, 821 (7th Cir. 2020) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted). In doing so, we may not \u201creweigh\nevidence or reassess witness credibility and may uphold a\nconviction based on circumstantial evidence.\u201d Id. \u201cA verdict\nwill be overturned on appeal only if the record is devoid of\nevidence from which a rational trier of fact could find guilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Freed, 921 F.3d at 722 (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n    To sustain a conspiracy conviction under \u00a7 371, the gov\u2010\nernment must prove the following elements beyond a reason\u2010\nable doubt: \u201c(1) an agreement to commit an offense against\nthe United States; (2) an overt act in furtherance of the con\u2010\nspiracy; and (3) knowledge of the conspiratorial purpose.\u201d\nUnited States v. Jones, 993 F.3d 519, 531 (7th Cir. 2021) (citation\nomitted). The \u201cessence of a conspiracy \u2026 is to join an agree\u2010\nment, not a group.\u201d United States v. Curry, 977 F.2d 1042, 1053\n(7th Cir. 1992). \u201cAs we have often noted, \u2018[a]n agreement need\nnot be explicit; a tacit agreement may support a conspiracy\n\f12                                                    No. 21\u20102753\n\nconviction.\u2019\u201d United States v. Avila, 557 F.3d 809, 815 (7th Cir.\n2009) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Handlin,\n366 F.3d 584, 589 (7th Cir. 2004)). Circumstantial evidence\nmay be enough to prove an agreement\u2014for example, evi\u2010\ndence \u201caimed at showing that the co\u2010conspirators embraced\nthe criminal objective of the conspiracy, the conspiracy con\u2010\ntinued onward towards its common goal,\u201d and the relation\u2010\nship among the co\u2010conspirators was a cooperative one. Han\u2010\ndlin, 366 F.3d at 589. However, \u201c[w]here the jury is left with\ntwo equally plausible inferences from the circumstantial evi\u2010\ndence, guilty or not guilty, it must necessarily entertain a rea\u2010\nsonable doubt.\u201d United States v. Vizcarra\u2010Millan, 15 F.4th 473,\n507 (7th Cir. 2021), cert. denied sub nom. Grundy v. United States,\n142 S. Ct. 838 (2022).\n    On this issue, our review is a deferential one. The evidence\nat trial, specifically the surveillance video footage, clears the\nbar for sufficient evidence. Even without audio, the footage\nshows Foy, Harvey, Simpson, and others taking cooperative\nsteps to reach the ATM\u2019s protected contents. The group\nshared tools, passing them back and forth, as various people\ntook turns attempting to break open the ATM. The individu\u2010\nals also at times jointly exerted force and directed each other\u2019s\nactions. As such, regardless of whether they came to the ATM\ntogether or as strangers, they acted as a group, working coop\u2010\neratively toward the common goal of stealing money from the\nATM. Therefore, while there is no evidence of a spoken agree\u2010\nment, it is rational to conclude that the footage does not pre\u2010\nsent two equally plausible inferences. Viewing the footage in\nthe light most favorable to the government, a rational trier of\nfact could have found that it more plausibly demonstrates\nthat Foy entered into a tacit agreement with his co\u2010conspira\u2010\ntors to rob the ATM.\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                    13\n\n    We see no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion and thus\naffirm Foy\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to steal money from the\nBank of America ATM.\n       Sentencing\n    The third and final issue on appeal is whether the district\ncourt erred in relying on the contemporaneous protests in re\u2010\nsponse to the killing of George Floyd as an aggravating factor\nin sentencing Foy. Defendants may challenge the sentencing\nprocedure and the substantive reasonableness of the resulting\nsentence. United States v. Figueroa, 622 F.3d 739, 743 (7th Cir.\n2010). Foy raises only a procedural objection\u2014that the district\ncourt connected his offense to the widespread looting sparked\nby George Floyd\u2019s death without sufficient evidence to do so.\nIn response, the government asserts that Foy waived any chal\u2010\nlenge to the district court\u2019s consideration of the civil unrest as\nprocedural error.\n    The parties agree that Foy did not raise this objection be\u2010\nlow, but they disagree about whether the argument was\nwaived or forfeited. The answer dictates our standard of re\u2010\nview. \u201cWaiver occurs when a party intentionally relinquishes\na known right and forfeiture arises when a party inadvert\u2010\nently fails to raise an argument in the district court. We review\nforfeited arguments for plain error, whereas waiver extin\u2010\nguishes error and precludes appellate review.\u201d United States\nv. Flores, 929 F.3d 443, 447 (7th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).\n    Generally, \u201cmere failure to make a particular objection on\na specified ground during a sentencing hearing\u201d constitutes\nforfeiture and \u201cresult[s] in plain error review on appeal.\u201d\nUnited States v. Walton, 255 F.3d 437, 442 (7th Cir. 2001). How\u2010\never, failing to make a particular objection may result in\n\f14                                                 No. 21\u20102753\n\nwaiver \u201cwhen the defendant had a targeted sentencing strat\u2010\negy that led him to waive certain other sentencing argu\u2010\nments.\u201d Flores, 929 F.3d at 448. \u201cBecause the waiver principle\nis construed liberally in favor of the defendant, we are cau\u2010\ntious about interpreting a defendant\u2019s behavior as intentional\nrelinquishment.\u201d United States v. Barnes, 883 F.3d 955, 957 (7th\nCir. 2018).\n   The government\u2019s initial sentencing memorandum ar\u2010\ngued that Foy\u2019s offense was sufficiently serious under 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) because it contributed to the wide\u2010\nspread looting that occurred following the killing of George\nFloyd. Specifically, the memorandum stated:\n       The looting by defendant (and others) during\n       the days following the death of George Floyd\n       required the expenditure of a significant\n       amount of public resources. Further, the looting\n       caused reputational harm to the City of Chi\u2010\n       cago; undercut the message of peaceful protes\u2010\n       tors; and shook many Chicago residents\u2019 funda\u2010\n       mental sense of security and faith in society. De\u2010\n       fendant\u2019s offense is therefore very serious.\nThis information was also included in the government\u2019s ver\u2010\nsion of the offense attached to the PSR.\n   In response to the PSR, Foy filed a sentencing memoran\u2010\ndum arguing that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted a low\u2010\nGuidelines sentence. In doing so, he \u201cacknowledge[d] [that]\nthe conduct of which he was found guilty indirectly had an\nincalculable impact on the public.\u201d In a subsequent sentenc\u2010\ning memorandum, Foy objected to the government\u2019s in\u2010\ntended loss calculation and noted that his crime took place\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                  15\n\n\u201cagainst a backdrop of looting and heavy civil unrest\u201d in Chi\u2010\ncago.\n    At the sentencing hearing, Foy made no additional objec\u2010\ntions to the PSR. The district court declined to apply the dan\u2010\ngerous weapon enhancement, accepted a revised intended\nloss calculation agreed to by both parties, and otherwise\nadopted the PSR. Before announcing its sentence, the district\ncourt set out its sentencing rationale, discussing both mitigat\u2010\ning and aggravating factors. The district court pointed to the\nfact that Foy\u2019s crime occurred \u201cduring the days following the\ndeath of George Floyd\u201d as \u201cone of the most important aggra\u2010\nvating factors\u201d in his case. The district court paraphrased the\ngovernment\u2019s sentencing memorandum\u2014noting that Foy\u2019s\ncrime contributed to \u201cthe expenditure of [a] significant\namount of public resources\u201d and that the widespread \u201clooting\ncaused reputational harm to the City of Chicago, undercut the\nmessage of peaceful protesters, and shook many Chicago res\u2010\nidents\u2019 fundamental sense of security and faith in society.\u201d In\nconcluding that his conduct was \u201cextremely aggravating,\u201d the\ndistrict court noted that Foy and those alongside him \u201ctook\nadvantage of a wounded city that was doing its best to both\nallow peaceful protests and keep people from going out and\ncommitting crimes.\u201d Foy now argues that \u201cthere was no ac\u2010\ntual record evidence tying the acts at issue to the protests,\u201d\nand therefore, the district court procedurally erred by making\nthat connection based solely on the government\u2019s articulation\nof the offense.\n    \u201cThe lines between waiver and forfeiture are not always\nclear.\u201d United States v. Robinson, 964 F.3d 632, 640 (7th Cir.\n2020). However, construing the record liberally in Foy\u2019s favor,\nno waiver occurred here. Although Foy\u2019s sentencing\n\f16                                                  No. 21\u20102753\n\nmemoranda referenced the looting taking place in Chicago at\nthe time of his offense, he never \u201cactively disclaimed the po\u2010\nsition[] he now raises\u201d\u2014that the record does not sufficiently\ndemonstrate his offense was connected to the widespread loot\u2010\ning to warrant its consideration as an aggravating factor.\nUnited States v. Seal, 813 F.3d 1038, 1045 (7th Cir. 2016) (hold\u2010\ning defendant \u201cforfeited, but did not waive\u201d arguments con\u2010\ncerning the court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements,\nwhere his objections at sentencing \u201chinged on a single argu\u2010\nment\u201d but \u201che never actively disclaimed the positions he now\nraises\u201d).\n    Foy\u2019s two references to the widespread looting appear to\nhave been made in response to arguments advanced by the\ngovernment. In making those references, Foy did not ex\u2010\npressly adopt the government\u2019s characterization of his of\u2010\nfense or advocate its adoption. Cf. Barnes, 883 F.3d at 958 (con\u2010\ncluding that defendant waived an objection to the inclusion\nof certain offenses in his criminal history calculation by \u201cspe\u2010\ncifically and repeatedly t[elling] the district court that it was\nappropriate to assign him a criminal history point for each of\nthe \u2026 offenses\u201d). While it is challenging to ascertain the pur\u2010\npose\u2014strategic or accidental\u2014of Foy\u2019s failure to object when\nviewing a cold record, we conclude that he did not knowingly\nand intentionally waive his objection to the district court\u2019s re\u2010\nliance on the widespread looting that occurred in the after\u2010\nmath of George Floyd\u2019s death as an aggravating factor.\n   So, we will review Foy\u2019s forfeited objection for plain error.\nPlain\u2010error review involves four steps:\n       First, there must be an error or defect\u2014some\n       sort of deviation from a legal rule\u2014that has not\n       been intentionally relinquished or abandoned,\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                      17\n\n       i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant....\n       Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious,\n       rather than subject to reasonable dispute....\n       Third, the error must have affected the appel\u2010\n       lant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary\n       case means he must demonstrate that it affected\n       the outcome of the district court proceedings....\n       Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are\n       satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion\n       to remedy the error\u2014discretion which ought to\n       be exercised only if the error seriously affect[s]\n       the fairness, integrity or public reputation of ju\u2010\n       dicial proceedings.\nHyatt, 28 F.4th at 782 (alterations in original) (quoting Puckett\nv. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135 (2009)). If all steps are satis\u2010\nfied, \u201c[r]emand for resentencing is appropriate on plain\u2010er\u2010\nror\u201d grounds. United States v. Burgess, 22 F.4th 680, 686 (7th\nCir. 2022).\n     \u201cOur task is to ensure that the district court committed no\nsignificant procedural error, such as incorrectly calculating\nthe guidelines range, failing to consider the section 3553(a)\nfactors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,\nor failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence.\u201d United\nStates v. Salgado, 917 F.3d 966, 969 (7th Cir. 2019) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). A sentencing court is \u201cen\u2010\ntitled to rely on the factual information contained in the PSR\u201d\nwhen a defendant does not challenge the factual accuracy of\nthe PSR in their sentencing memorandum. United States v.\nAnaya, 32 F.3d 308, 313 n.2 (7th Cir. 1994). The court \u201cmust\nadequately explain the chosen sentence,\u201d Gall v. United States,\n552 U.S. 38, 50 (2007), but may not \u201cventure[] too far from the\n\f18                                                  No. 21\u20102753\n\nrecord\u201d in doing so, United States v. Smith, 400 F. App\u2019x 96, 99\n(7th Cir. 2010). Furthermore, \u201cit is inappropriate to blame [a\ndefendant] for issues of broad local, national, and interna\u2010\ntional scope that only tangentially relate to his underlying\nconduct.\u201d United States v. Robinson, 829 F.3d 878, 880 (7th Cir.\n2016) (alteration in original) (citation omitted).\n    Foy argues on appeal that the court erred in linking Foy\u2019s\nconduct to the George Floyd protests \u201cwithout any evidence\nin the record that showed that these two were in fact con\u2010\nnected in any meaningful way.\u201d The PSR notes that Foy\u2019s \u201cac\u2010\ntions took place in the days following the death of George\nFloyd\u201d and cites two newspaper articles in support of its as\u2010\nsertions regarding the damage caused by the \u201cwidespread\nlooting\u201d occurring at the time. At trial, a CPD officer testified\nthat on the day of Foy\u2019s offense, there was \u201crioting, looting,\n[and] destruction of property [occurring] throughout the en\u2010\ntire city and the Seventh District of Chicago,\u201d where Foy\u2019s of\u2010\nfense took place.\n    Considering this information, we conclude that the district\ncourt did not commit error, let alone a clear or obvious one,\nin finding that Foy\u2019s brazen act contributed to the widespread\nlooting and property destruction taking place in Chicago at\nthe time. Foy\u2019s conduct was more than \u201ctangentially re\u2010\nlate[d]\u201d to the George Floyd protests, Robinson, 829 F.3d at 880\n(citation omitted); as he himself argued to the district court,\nhis attempt to rob an ATM in broad daylight took place\n\u201cagainst a backdrop of looting and heavy civil unrest\u201d in Chi\u2010\ncago and \u201cthe conduct of which he was found guilty indi\u2010\nrectly had an incalculable impact on the public.\u201d Thus, we do\nnot see the district court\u2019s comments as \u201cso far out of bounds\u201d\nas to entitle Foy to resentencing. Figueroa, 622 F.3d at 744.\n\fNo. 21\u20102753                                                  19\n\nInstead, they were relevant to the offense and supported by\nthe record. As such, we affirm Foy\u2019s sentence. Cf. United States\nv. Hatch, 909 F.3d 872, 875 (7th Cir. 2018) (affirming sentence\nand concluding district court did not commit procedural error\nby \u201cmerely situat[ing] [defendant\u2019s] offense against the back\u2010\ndrop of statistics and observations about widespread gun vi\u2010\nolence in Chicago\u201d).\n\n                    III.   Conclusion\n\n    For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM Foy\u2019s convic\u2010\ntion and sentence.\n\f",
