GIOVONNTE MADDOX v. THE STATE.\n\n      In 2011, Giovonnte Maddox pleaded guilty to armed robbery, kidnaping, and\ntwo counts of aggravated assault. In 2019, the trial court denied Maddox\u2019s motion for\n\nan out-of-time appeal. In 2020, Maddox filed both a notice of appeal and an\napplication for discretionary appeal from the trial court\u2019s order, but both of his\n\nattempts to appeal were dismissed as untimely. See Case Nos. A20D0049 (dismissed,\nSept. 13, 2019); A20A0464 (dismissed, Oct. 9, 2019). In January and August 2020,\n\nMaddox filed subsequent motions for an out-of-time appeal, which the trial court\ndenied on April 1, 2021. Maddox filed both a timely application for discretionary\n\nappeal and notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s order.\n      Because Maddox has not yet had a direct appeal, he is entitled to appeal from\n\nthe court\u2019s order. See Richards v. State, 275 Ga. 190, 191 (563 SE2d 856) (2002).\nHowever, his out-of-time appeal is already pending before this Court in Case No.\n\fA21A1367. Accordingly, this application is superfluous, and it is hereby\nDISMISSED.\n\n\n                                 Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\n                                        Clerk\u2019s Office, Atlanta,____________________\n                                                                  05/03/2021\n                                        I certify that the above is a true extract from\n                                 the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\n                                         Witness my signature and the seal of said court\n                                 hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\n\n\n                                                                                , Clerk.\n\f",
