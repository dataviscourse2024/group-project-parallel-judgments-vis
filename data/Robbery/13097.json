NELSON, Circuit Judges.\n    \n    \n      1\n      MEMORANDUM**\n    \n    \n      2\n      Robert William Johnson appeals his sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines imposed following his guilty plea to aggravated robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2114.  He contends that he was entitled to a downward departure based on extraordinary military service.  The district court indicated that it would not depart downward even if it could.  We lack jurisdiction to review the district court's discretionary refusal to depart downward.  See United States v.
