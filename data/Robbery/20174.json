Rodarte v. State,\r\n860 S.W.2d 108 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993); Shute v. State, 744 S.W.2d 96 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988).  We\r\nlack authority to dispose of the purported appeal in any manner other than by dismissing it for want of\r\njurisdiction.  Olivo v. State, 918 S.W.2d 519, 523 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).  Appellant must await this\r\nCourt's mandate of dismissal, after which he may file a post-conviction application for writ of habeas corpus\r\nseeking an out-of-time appeal.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.07, \u00a7 2 (West Supp. 1997).\r\n\r\nAppellant's motion for out-of-time appeal is dismissed.  The appeal is dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Chief Justice Carroll, Justices Aboussie and B.
