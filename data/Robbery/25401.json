Conner asserts the district court erred by excluding statements the\ndecedent made in the week prior to his death. We affirm.\n                                               I.\n              FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       One evening, at approximately 8:50 p.m., Conner called 911 and reported having found\nhis eighty-seven-year-old father, Otis Conner (\u201cOtis\u201d), dead in the garage of the home they\nshared. Conner indicated to the police that he had come home to find that Otis had fallen off a\nten-foot ladder while trying to retrieve items from an attic storage area and hit his head on the\nconcrete floor or steps. After an initial investigation, including discussions with Otis\u2019s sons,\n\n                                               1\n\fDoug Conner and Randy Conner, who expressed concern that Otis\u2019s death may not have been\ncaused by a fall, the police obtained and executed a search warrant for Conner\u2019s residence.\n        Detectives found stains on the carpet between the dining room and the living room.\nWhen detectives moved an oddly-positioned chair and rug, the detectives observed two more\nstains near a heat register. Subsequent DNA tests showed that Otis\u2019s blood was found on a rug\nin the laundry room, on the east living room wall, in the carpeting under the heat register, in a\ncarpet cleaning machine, on the underside of a chair in the living room, on the living room\nceiling, on the garage floor, on one of the legs of the ladder, and on the claw of a hammer.\nForensic investigators also tested for the presence of blood which was detected on the windowsill\nand the baseboard area near the carpet stains as well as on the kitchen floor, around the kitchen\nsink, and on the laundry room floor.       The tests indicated \u201clinear impressions\u201d which the\ninvestigators reported as \u201cdrag marks.\u201d Based on these findings, the State theorized that Conner\nhit Otis on the head with a hammer in the living room, dragged his body to the garage, and\nstaged an accident using the ladder. Based on discussions with Doug Conner and Randy Conner\nand financial records obtained in the course of the investigation, the State posited that Conner\u2019s\nmotive was financial gain. Conner was charged with first degree murder, grand theft, forgery,\nand destruction, alteration, or concealment of evidence.\n        At trial, Conner testified that in the week prior to Otis\u2019s death, Conner returned home to\nfind Otis cleaning the living room rug with a large gauze bandage on his head. Otis told Conner\nhe had fallen. Conner stated he did not see any blood stains because Otis had moved an area rug\nover them. Conner testified that the next day he again returned home to find Otis using a carpet\ncleaning machine over the rug. There were two large blood spots on the rug and the heat register\nwas also bloody. Conner stated that the gauze bandage from the day before had been replaced\nwith a larger bandage. Conner further testified that Otis attempted to lift the heat register but\ncould not get his fingers underneath its edge, so Conner retrieved a hammer from the garage,\npried up the heat register with the claws of the hammer, and rinsed off the register in the kitchen\nsink.\n        Prior to trial, Conner moved to admit statements allegedly made by Otis to Kelly Riggs, a\nfamily friend, about Otis falling, injuring his head, and trying to remove the blood stains.\nConner argued that Otis\u2019s prior statements were admissible because they fell under the hearsay\nexceptions contained within the Idaho Rules of Evidence. The district court reserved ruling on\n\n                                                2\n\fConner\u2019s motion until trial. At trial, Conner argued that under I.R.E. 803(3) and (24), the\nstatements allegedly made by Otis to Riggs should be admitted. In an offer of proof regarding\nhis proposed testimony, Riggs told the district court that when he visited Otis a few days before\nhe passed away, Otis had a bandage on his forehead. Riggs stated that Otis told him he had\nfallen while getting up out of his chair, hit his head, laid on the floor for a while, bled on the\ncarpet, tried unsuccessfully to clean it up, and moved a chair to cover the blood spot. The district\ncourt ruled that Otis\u2019s hearsay statements were not admissible under Rule 803(3) or (24).1 Riggs\nwas allowed to testify only as to his visit with Otis and his observation that Otis had a bandage\non his forehead. Riggs\u2019 wife also testified that she had seen a bandage on Otis\u2019s head during the\nsame visit, albeit a smaller-type bandage than Riggs described.\n       The jury found Conner guilty of second degree murder and destruction, alteration, or\nconcealment of evidence, but was unable to reach a verdict on the other charges. At sentencing,\nthe district court, based on a motion by the State, dismissed the grand theft and forgery charges.\nThe district court entered judgment against Conner and sentenced him to a unified term of thirty\nyears with eighteen years determinate on the second degree murder conviction, and imposed a\nconcurrent sentence of five years determinate on the destruction, alteration, or concealment of\nevidence conviction. Conner timely appeals.\n                                                 II.\n                                            ANALYSIS\n       Conner challenges the district court\u2019s ruling which excluded the statements Otis made to\nRiggs in the week prior to his death.        Alternatively, Conner asserts that the district court\ncommitted fundamental error by excluding the statements.\nA.     Exclusion of Hearsay Statements\n       Conner argues that the district court erred in denying Conner\u2019s motion to admit certain\nstatements made by Otis. Conner sought to admit Riggs\u2019 testimony relating to statements made\nby Otis in the week prior to his death, specifically:\n       We talked about several things. When my family come in, I noticed a bandage on\n       his forehead high on the right side by the hairline, a fairly large bandage. I asked\n       him what happened to his head. He said he got up out of the chair, lost his\n       balance, fell down, hit his head, laid there for a while, didn\u2019t know how long. He\n\n1\n       On appeal, Conner does not argue that the district court erred in excluding the statements\nunder Idaho Rule of Evidence 803(3).\n                                                  3\n\f       didn\u2019t know how long he was on the floor. Got up, had bled on the carpet. Fixed\n       his head and then tried to clean the blood out of the carpet. Couldn\u2019t. And so he\n       slid the chair over it, over the blood spot.\n       On appeal, Conner argues that Riggs\u2019 testimony was admissible under what is commonly\nknown at the \u201ccatchall\u201d hearsay exception, I.R.E. 803(24), which states:\n              A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions\n       but having the equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court\n       determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the\n       statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other\n       evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the\n       general purpose of these rules and the interest of justice will be best served by\n       admission of the statement into evidence.\n       The decision whether to admit evidence at trial is generally within the province of the\ntrial court. A trial court\u2019s determination that evidence is supported by a proper foundation is\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion. State v. Gilpin, 132 Idaho 643, 646, 977 P.2d 905, 908 (Ct.\nApp. 1999). Therefore, a trial court\u2019s determination as to the admission of evidence at trial will\nonly be reversed where there has been an abuse of that discretion. State v. Zimmerman, 121\nIdaho 971, 973-74, 829 P.2d 861, 863-64 (1992). When a trial court\u2019s discretionary decision is\nreviewed on appeal, the appellate court conducts a multi-tiered inquiry to determine whether the\nlower court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion, acted within the boundaries of such\ndiscretion and consistently with any legal standards applicable to the specific choices before it,\nand reached its decision by an exercise of reason. State v. Hedger, 115 Idaho 598, 600, 768 P.2d\n1331, 1333 (1989).\n       In ruling that the testimony was inadmissible under Rule 803(24), the district court stated:\n               I do not find that it is admissible under 803(24) as the--what\u2019s come to be\n       called the catchall exception. That originated from an old case having to do with\n       the use of old newspapers, but it is sparingly, if at all, applied, and in part because\n       there needs to be some guarantee--other circumstantial--well, as the State puts it,\n       evidence of trustworthy.\n               And we don\u2019t have anything here that shows us anymore trustworthiness\n       than any statement made by a witness. The problem is, as Mr. Bailey points out,\n       the actual witness testifying isn\u2019t with us. And so there is nothing particularly\n       about the circumstances of that conversation that would make its recitation\n       through this witness particularly trustworthy.\n               So I will not allow that conversation. You\u2019re certainly entitled to appeal\n       and disagree.\n       Our first inquiry is whether the statements were hearsay.          Hearsay is defined as a\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\n\n                                                 4\n\fevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. I.R.E. 801(c); State v. Gomez, 126 Idaho 700,\n704, 889 P.2d 729, 733 (Ct. App. 1994). Hearsay is inadmissible unless otherwise provided by\nan exception in the Idaho Rules of Evidence or other rules of the Idaho Supreme Court.\nI.R.E. 802. The district court examined the statements allegedly made by Otis and determined\nthat they were being offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein and were, therefore,\nhearsay. The next inquiry is whether they were admissible under an exception to the hearsay\nrule.\n        Conner argues that the district court abused its discretion because the exclusion of the\nevidence was based upon the court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence was not \u201cparticularly\ntrustworthy,\u201d which Conner asserts is a higher standard than \u201cthe equivalent circumstantial\nguarantees of trustworthiness\u201d language found in Rule 803. Rather, Conner avers, evidence\nadmitted under the catchall exception need only \u201cdemonstrate a trustworthiness within the spirit\nof the specifically stated exceptions.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion. It is\napparent that the trial court understood the issue to be a discretionary one and correctly\nrecognized and applied the guiding principles of Rule 803(24). Although the district court did\nnot use the specific language from the rule, it is apparent from its ruling that the district court\nwas looking for \u201cthe equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d The district court\ndid not misunderstand the standard of the rule and in using the word \u201cparticularly\u201d did not\nimpose a higher threshold than that generally imposed upon those exceptions specifically stated\nin Rule 803. To that end, we hold that the first criteria of Rule 803(24), that the statement carries\ncircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to those of the other Rule 803 hearsay\nexceptions, is not satisfied here.      The offer of proof did not describe anything in the\ncircumstances under which Otis made the statements that would give an aura of truthfulness or\nreliability to the statements. It is simply a conversation that bears no circumstantial guarantees\nof trustworthiness. That is not to say that the witness was not truthful, but only that the\nstatements are not inherently or circumstantially trustworthy. Accordingly, we find no error in\nthe exclusion of Riggs\u2019 hearsay testimony.\nB.      Fundamental Error\n        Alternatively, Conner argues that the district court committed fundamental error by\nviolating Conner\u2019s constitutional right to present evidence when it excluded Riggs\u2019 testimony\nrelating to the statements Otis made to him. Conner acknowledges he did not raise this claim\n\n                                                 5\n\fbefore the district court. Generally, issues not raised below may not be considered for the first\ntime on appeal. State v. Fodge, 121 Idaho 192, 195, 824 P.2d 123, 126 (1992). However, Idaho\nappellate courts may consider a claim of error to which no objection was made in the trial court\nif the issue presented rises to the level of fundamental error. State v. Field, 144 Idaho 559, 571,\n165 P.3d 273, 285 (2007); State v. Haggard, 94 Idaho 249, 251, 486 P.2d 260, 262 (1971); State\nv. Hansen, 154 Idaho 882, 886-87, 303 P.3d 241, 245-46 (Ct. App. 2013). A fundamental error\nis one that: (1) violates one or more of the defendant\u2019s unwaived constitutional rights; (2) is\nclear or obvious without the need for reference to any additional information not contained in the\nappellate record; and (3) affects the outcome of the trial proceedings. State v. Perry, 150 Idaho\n209, 226, 245 P.3d 961, 978 (2010).\n         The right to present evidence is grounded in the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Compulsory Process\nClause. Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 409-10 (1988); State v. Harris, 132 Idaho 843, 846, 979\nP.2d 1201, 1204 (1999). Conner contends that excluding Otis\u2019s statements violated this right.\nWe disagree. The substance of the claimed error is that the jury should have heard testimony\nthat supported the defense\u2019s theory as to why there was a large amount of Otis\u2019s blood found\ninside the house, even though Otis\u2019s body was found in the garage, despite the fact that the\ntestimony was hearsay and deemed inadmissible under the Idaho Rules of Evidence. \u201cWhere the\nasserted error relates not to infringement upon a constitutional right, but to violation of a rule or\nstatute, the fundamental error doctrine is not implicated.\u201d State v. Garcia, 156 Idaho 352, 356,\n326 P.3d 354, 358 (Ct. App. 2014); see State v. Jackson, 151 Idaho 376, 256 P.3d 784 (Ct. App.\n2011).\n         To hold that the presentation of evidence and associated argument in violation of\n         an evidentiary rule satisfies the constitutional violation element of Perry because\n         all evidentiary error implicates due process would, in our view, virtually\n         eviscerate the first prong of the Perry standard and contravene the limits that\n         Perry places on fundamental error review.\nGarcia, 156 Idaho at 356-57, 326 P.3d at 358-59 (quoting Jackson, 151 Idaho at 379-80, 256\nP.3d at 787-88). See also State v. Norton, 151 Idaho 176, 184-87, 254 P.3d 77, 85-88 (Ct. App.\n2011).\n         In support of his argument that the Sixth Amendment right to present evidence can\nsupersede state rules of evidence, Conner primarily relies upon State v. Thomas, 157 Idaho 916,\n342 P.3d 628 (2015), State v. Perry, 139 Idaho 520, 81 P.3d 1230 (2003), and State v. Peite, 122\nIdaho 809, 839 P.2d 1223 (Ct. App. 1992). However, in each of these cases, the Idaho appellate\n                                                 6\n\fcourts analyzed whether evidence was admissible under the Idaho Rules of Evidence in addition\nto whether the exclusion of evidence was a violation of constitutional rights. Further, Conner\navers that the language in State v. Meister, 148 Idaho 236, 220 P.3d 1055 (2009), acknowledges\nthere will be rare cases where the evidence is not admissible under the rules, but nevertheless\nmust be admitted in the interests of due process. In Meister, the Idaho Supreme Court stated that\n\u201cthis Court adopts an approach which holds that the Rules of Evidence generally govern the\nadmission of all evidence in the courts of this State.\u201d Id. at 240, 220 P.3d at 1059. Conner\npoints to the phrase \u201cgenerally govern\u201d to demonstrate his contention. However, Meister does\nnot suggest this conclusion in its context or outcome and does not stand as authority for such a\nproposition.2 While it may be true that there are exceptional cases where evidence otherwise\ninadmissible under the Rules of Evidence would be admitted in the interests of due process, this\nis not such a case. We have affirmed that Otis\u2019s statements made to Riggs were properly\nexcluded from evidence based on the lack of guarantees of trustworthiness. There is no right to\nadmit untrustworthy evidence simply by claiming a constitutional violation. Thus, the exclusion\nof evidence in this case is not reviewable as fundamental error.\n                                               III.\n                                        CONCLUSION\n       Conner has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying\nhis motion to admit statements made by Otis in the week prior to his death. Further, Conner has\nnot shown it was fundamental error for the district court to exclude these statements. We affirm\n\n2\n        In Meister, the defendant was charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit\nmurder. State v. Meister, 148 Idaho 236, 238, 220 P.3d 1055, 1057 (2009). At trial, the\ndefendant sought to introduce evidence that another individual was responsible for the murder.\nId. The district court refused to allow the defendant to introduce any evidence which showed the\nother individual was responsible for the murders, including a confession by that individual. Id. at\n238-39, 220 P.3d at 1057-58. On appeal, Meister claimed that the district court\u2019s refusal to allow\nhim to admit evidence of the confession deprived him of his constitutional right to provide a full\nand complete defense. Id. at 239-40, 220 P.3d at 1058-59. The Idaho Supreme Court held that\nthe district court should have analyzed whether the confession was admissible under the Idaho\nRules of Evidence. Id. at 240-41, 220 P.3d at 1059-60. The Court explained that the Idaho\nRules of Evidence \u201cembody the balancing test which safeguards a defendant\u2019s constitutional\nright to present a defense along with protection of the state\u2019s interest in the integrity of the\ncriminal trial process.\u201d Id. at 240, 220 P.3d at 1060. \u201cMeister should be afforded the\nopportunity to present his complete and full defense, which includes the presentation of all\nrelevant evidence in the context of trial pursuant to any limitations of the Idaho Rules of\nEvidence.\u201d Id. at 241, 220 P.3d at 1060 (emphasis added).\n                                                7\n\fthe district court\u2019s denial of Conner\u2019s motion to admit certain statements. Accordingly, Conner\u2019s\njudgment and conviction for second degree murder and destruction, alteration, or concealment of\nevidence is affirmed.\n       Chief Judge MELANSON and Judge HUSKEY CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f",
