INTRODUCTION\n\n      Appellant Aaron Rene Glasspoole represented himself at trial with the\n\nassistance of standby counsel and was convicted by a jury of aggravated\n\nrobbery.   See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.03(a)(2) (West 2011).        The jury\n\nassessed his punishment at life imprisonment, and the trial court sentenced him\n\n      1\n      See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\faccordingly.2 In his sole issue, Glasspoole argues that he did not knowingly,\n\nintelligently, and voluntarily waive his right to assistance of counsel. We will\n\naffirm.\n\n                                   II. BACKGROUND\n\n      Glasspoole was charged with aggravated robbery after a convenience\n\nstore clerk identified him as the individual who entered the store, displayed and\n\ncocked a gun, and stole two tubes from the store\u2019s safe that each contained $50\n\nin small bills. On the Wednesday before his trial was to begin the next Monday,\n\nGlasspoole filed a motion for a Faretta3 hearing in which he asserted his right to\n\nrepresent himself at trial. On the Friday before his trial, the trial court held a\n\nFaretta hearing.\n\n      During that hearing, Glasspoole told the trial court that he wanted to\n\nrepresent himself at trial.      The trial court then inquired into Glasspoole\u2019s\n\nbackground, eliciting that Glasspoole was thirty-seven years old, had obtained\n\nhis GED, and had represented himself twice previously.           The trial court told\n\nGlasspoole that it thought he was making a mistake in attempting to represent\n\nhimself and that he would receive no special consideration simply because he\n\nwas untrained in the law. The trial court warned Glasspoole that his lack of\n\nknowledge of evidentiary rules could be detrimental to his case and that he would\n\n      2\n       Glasspoole\u2019s punishment range was enhanced because he had two prior\nfelony convictions. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.42(d) (West Supp. 2015).\n      3\n          See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct. 2525 (1975).\n\n\n                                           2\n\fnot be able to claim ineffective assistance of counsel if he represented himself.\n\nThe trial court then stated that it would allow Glasspoole to represent himself, but\n\nthe trial court also appointed the assistant public defender\u2014who was\n\nrepresenting Glasspoole during the Faretta hearing\u2014as standby counsel.\n\n      On the day of his trial, just before the prospective jury members were\n\nbrought in for voir dire, Glasspoole again told the trial court that he wished to\n\nrepresent himself at trial. Glasspoole was allowed to represent himself, although\n\nhis standby counsel was present during all three days of his trial. Glasspoole\n\nconferred with his standby counsel on several occasions during voir dire, and his\n\nstandby counsel and the standby counsel\u2019s assistant answered several questions\n\nposed by the trial court during both the guilt/innocence phase and punishment\n\nphase of trial regarding Glasspoole\u2019s attempt to secure the attendance of\n\nwitnesses. Ultimately, the jury convicted Glasspoole of aggravated robbery and\n\nassessed his punishment at life imprisonment.\n\n                        III. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL\n\n                                   A. The Law\n\n      The United States Constitution gives criminal defendants the right to\n\nassistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions in which the defendant may be\n\npunished by imprisonment. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; see also Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.051 (West Supp. 2015). In lieu of being represented by\n\ncounsel, however, a criminal defendant also has a Sixth Amendment right to self-\n\nrepresentation. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 819\u201320, 95 S. Ct. at 2533. Before the trial\n\n\n                                         3\n\fcourt may allow a defendant to represent himself, the defendant must knowingly,\n\nintelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional right to assistance of counsel.\n\nId. at 835, 95 S. Ct. at 2541; Williams v. State, 252 S.W.3d 353, 356 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2008). In order for a waiver to be effective, the trial court must make the\n\ndefendant \u201caware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so\n\nthat the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is\n\nmade with eyes open.\u2019\u201d Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S. Ct. at 2541 (quoting\n\nAdams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S. Ct. 236, 242\n\n(1942)). The defendant should be made aware that there are technical rules of\n\nevidence and procedure and that he will not be granted any special consideration\n\nsolely because he asserted his pro se rights. Williams, 252 S.W.3d at 356. The\n\ntrial court, however, is not required to follow formulaic questioning or a particular\n\nscript in assuring that a defendant who has asserted his right to self-\n\nrepresentation does so with eyes open. Burgess v. State, 816 S.W.2d 424, 428\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1991); Fletcher v. State, 474 S.W.3d 389, 396 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2015, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\n      Courts draw a distinction between defendants who solely represent\n\nthemselves at trial and those who have the assistance of counsel. \u201cThe term\n\n\u2018standby counsel\u2019 usually describes situations when, in response to a defendant\u2019s\n\nrequest for self-representation, the trial court instead allows the defendant\u2019s\n\nattorney to remain as counsel and be available to advise the defendant and\n\nparticipate in the case, or not, as requested by the defendant.\u201d Dolph v. State,\n\n\n                                          4\n\f440 S.W.3d 898, 907 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2013, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Walker v.\n\nState, 962 S.W.2d 124, 126 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. ref\u2019d)). \u201cIn\n\nsuch a case, if the defendant thereafter invokes the participation of standby\n\ncounsel, the representation becomes hybrid, which has been described as\n\n\u2018partially pro se and partially by counsel.\u2019\u201d Dolph, 440 S.W.3d at 907 (citing\n\nLanders v. State, 550 S.W.2d 272, 280 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977)).\n\n      Texas courts have held that Faretta admonishments are not required for\n\ndefendants engaged in hybrid representation. See, e.g., Alexander v. State, No.\n\n02-15-00033-CR, 2016 WL 2586602, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth May 5, 2016,\n\npet. filed) (mem. op., not designated for publication); Dolph, 440 S.W.3d at 907;\n\nWalker, 962 S.W.2d at 126. Some courts, including this one, go even further,\n\nholding that Faretta admonishments are not required for defendants with standby\n\ncounsel. See, e.g., Bradford v. State, No. 05-14-01610-CR, 2016 WL 326631, at\n\n*2 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Jan. 27, 2016, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for\n\npublication); Anderson v. State, No. 2-02-00060-CR, 2003 WL 21101519, at *2\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth May 15, 2003, pet. ref\u2019d) (not designated for publication);\n\nWalker, 962 S.W.2d at 127; Robertson v. State, 934 S.W.2d 861, 866 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no pet.). But see Grant v. State, 255 S.W.3d\n\n642, 647 (Tex. App.\u2014Beaumont 2007, no pet.) (\u201c[I]n our view Faretta\n\nadmonishments should be given regardless of the appointment of standby\n\ncounsel.\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\f      The rationale for not requiring Faretta admonishments when a defendant\n\nhas hybrid representation or standby counsel is that \u201csince counsel remains to\n\nassist the accused [there is] no need to admonish the accused of the dangers\n\nand disadvantages of self-representation.\u201d Robinson v. State, No. 05-04-00235-\n\nCR, 2005 WL 1670626, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas July 19, 2005, no pet.) (not\n\ndesignated for publication). Indeed, Texas courts have repeatedly held that \u201cno\n\nquestion of waiver of counsel is involved\u201d in cases of hybrid representation or\n\ncases when a defendant has access to standby counsel. See, e.g., Maddox v.\n\nState, 613 S.W.2d 275, 286 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (op. on reh\u2019g) (holding no\n\nquestion of waiver when defendant engaged in hybrid representation); Phillips v.\n\nState, 604 S.W.2d 904, 908 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979) (same); Dolph, 440 S.W.3d\n\nat 907 (same); Jones v. State, No. 14-04-00950-CR, 2005 WL 2787306, at *1\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] Oct. 27, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op., not\n\ndesignated for publication) (holding no question of waiver when standby counsel\n\nis appointed); Robinson, 2005 WL 1670626, at *2 (same); Rainwater v. State,\n\n634 S.W.2d 67, 68 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1982, no pet.) (holding no question of\n\nwaiver when counsel relegated to an accessory role).\n\n                    B. Application of the Law to the Facts\n\n      Glasspoole argues that his waiver of his right to assistance of counsel was\n\nnot knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, pointing to the fact that he\n\nanswered many of the trial court\u2019s questions at the Faretta hearing with non\n\nsequiturs, that the trial court had to ask him multiple times whether he wished to\n\n\n                                        6\n\frepresent himself at trial before he responded, and that he performed poorly at\n\ntrial.4 But the record indicates that Glasspoole had standby counsel during his\n\nentire trial. The record also indicates that Glasspoole conferred with his standby\n\ncounsel during trial, and that his standby counsel answered several questions\n\nposed by the trial court regarding his attempt to secure the attendance of\n\nwitnesses. Because Glasspoole had standby counsel during his trial\u2014counsel\n\nthat participated, although to a limited degree, in the trial\u2014\u201cno question of waiver\n\nof counsel is involved.\u201d Maddox, 613 S.W.2d at 286; Phillips, 604 S.W.2d at 908;\n\nDolph, 440 S.W.3d at 907; Jones, 2005 WL 2787306, at *1; Robinson, 2005 WL\n\n1670626, at *2; Rainwater, 634 S.W.2d at 68. We thus overrule Glasspoole\u2019s\n\nsole issue.\n\n                                 IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      Having overruled Glasspoole\u2019s sole issue, we affirm the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgment.\n\n                                                   /s/ Sue Walker\n                                                   SUE WALKER\n                                                   JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: LIVINGSTON, C.J.; DAUPHINOT and WALKER, JJ.\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\nTex.
