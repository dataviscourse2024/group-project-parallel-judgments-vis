Dexter appeals the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief. We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                            ISSUES\n\n          Dexter raises three issues, which we restate as follows:\n\n          I.     Whether the post-conviction court erred in determining that Dexter\n                 voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel at his guilty plea\n                 hearing.\n\n          II.    Whether the post-conviction court erred in determining that laches\n                 precluded relief.\n\n          III.   Whether Dexter received ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel.\n\n                           FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          In early 2000, the State charged Dexter with twenty-seven counts of theft in\n\nrelation to a series of bad checks he wrote at Wal-Mart, Meijer, and Payless stores in\n\nTippecanoe County. On April 3, 2000, Dexter had an initial hearing. The trial court\n\nadvised him that he had the right to a public defender if he could not afford his own\n\nattorney. However, the court informed Dexter that if he was an able-bodied person and\n\ncould work, then the court would \u201crequire [Dexter to] go out there to make a good faith\n\neffort to hire your own attorney first before [asking] the taxpayers to use their money to\n\nhire your lawyer for you.\u201d Tr. Ex. Vol., Defendant\u2019s Ex. B. Dexter, who was free on\n\nbond pending trial, told the court that he worked thirty-four hours a week and paid child\n\nsupport and rent. The court told Dexter to \u201cgo out there and get another job and earn\n\nsome money to pay your way.\u201d Id.\n\n\n                                                2\n\f      Dexter next appeared before the trial court on May 5, 2000, and the court asked\n\nDexter what efforts he had made to hire an attorney. Dexter admitted he had \u201cmade no\n\nefforts,\u201d asserting that he spent his off-work time caring for his fianc\u00e9e, who was\n\nexperiencing complications in her pregnancy. Id. The court asked Dexter if he had\n\nenough money to \u201ctake care of all your necessities,\u201d and Dexter said, \u201cYeah.\u201d Id. The\n\ncourt concluded, \u201cWell, okay then you have enough money to go hire a lawyer. That\u2019s a\n\nnecessity right now.\u201d Id. The trial court further advised Dexter to \u201ccome back here with\n\na lawyer on the nineteenth.\u201d Id.\n\n      Dexter did not hire a lawyer. Instead, he entered into a plea agreement with the\n\nState. Dexter agreed to plead guilty to two counts of theft, both as Class D felonies, in\n\nconnection with two acts of exerting unauthorized control over a Meijer store\u2019s property\n\nwith intent to deprive Meijer of the property\u2019s value. In exchange, the State agreed to\n\ndismiss the other charges.\n\n      On May 31, 2000, Dexter appeared before the trial court, along with other\n\ndefendants, for a guilty plea hearing. Before the hearing, Dexter signed a form advising\n\nhim of his rights. The form provided, among other advisements,\n\n      You have the right to be represented by an attorney now and at every stage\n      of the court proceedings. If you are charged with a felony or misdemeanor\n      and you want an attorney but cannot afford to hire your own attorney, tell\n      the judge. The judge will ask you questions under oath to see if you qualify\n      to have an attorney represent you at public expense. If the judge appoints\n      an attorney, you may be ordered to pay back all or part of the cost of the\n      attorney\u2019s services to you. If you first decide you are going to hire your\n      own attorney but later are unable to do so, you can come back to court and\n      ask the judge to appoint an attorney for you.\n\nAppellant\u2019s App. p. 44.\n\n                                           3\n\f      Toward the bottom of the form, a paragraph captioned \u201cACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nOF RIGHTS\u201d provided:\n\n      I read, write, and understand the English language. I have read Your Rights\n      in Court. I understand my rights explained in this paper and by the judge. I\n      freely, knowingly, and voluntarily waive my rights and want to plead\n      guilty. My guilty plea is my own free and voluntary act. I am not under\n      the influence of alcohol, medication or controlled substances at this time.\n      No promises, threats or guarantees, other than any plea agreement, were\n      made to get me to plead guilty in this case. I understand the charge(s) to\n      which I am pleading guilty and the consequences of my plea of guilty. I\n      admit as true the essential facts of the charge(s) to which I am pleading\n      guilty. I agree to waive any defenses I may have raised at trial . . . . I have\n      been given enough time to think about what I am doing. I am 22 years old.\n      I completed the 12[th] grade in school.\n\nId. at 45. Dexter signed his name and stated the date under this paragraph. He also\n\nsigned his name and stated the date under the last paragraph on the form, captioned\n\n\u201cWAIVER OF ATTORNEY:\u201d\n\n      I understand my right to be represented by an attorney. I know I can ask to\n      continue this case to give me time to talk to an attorney. I know the court\n      could appoint an attorney for me if I cannot afford to hire my own attorney.\n      But I want to represent myself and freely, knowingly, and voluntarily waive\n      my rights to an attorney in this case. I understand the consequences of this\n      waiver.\n\nId.\n\n      At the guilty plea hearing, the trial court asked Dexter and other defendants the\n\nfollowing questions, to which Dexter responded:\n\n      [Court]:      Has everybody carefully read the written advice of rights\n                    form or had it read to you? Has everybody read through or\n                    had read to [sic] the possible penalties section, and did you\n                    each sign your own written advice of rights form where it\n                    says acknowledgement of rights? And for those of you who\n                    are without counsel today, have you also read carefully the\n                    paragraph called waiver of attorney? And if so, does your\n\n                                            4\n\f                     signature mean that you read, write and understand English\n                     well enough that you understand the right [sic] and penalties\n                     explained in this form and that you understand that a plea of\n                     guilty is a waiver and a giving up of those rights? Would that\n                     be an accurate statement of your understanding?\n\n      [Dexter]:      Yes.\n\nTr. Ex. Vol., Defendant\u2019s Ex. B. The trial court further asked Dexter and the other\n\ndefendants the following question:\n\n      [Court]:       A plea of guilty is your admission from your own words that\n                     you are guilty of this crime and that you acknowledge as truth\n                     all the essential elements of the crime. Do you understand\n                     that?\n\n      [Dexter]:      Yes.\n\nId.\n\n      Next, the court advised Dexter of the rights he waived by pleading guilty and the\n\npossible consequences of pleading guilty. The court also asked Dexter if he had any\n\nquestions about the charges to which he was pleading guilty, and Dexter did not indicate\n\nthat he had any. At that point, the court placed Dexter under oath and the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n      [Court]:       Mr. Dexter you are pleading guilty in DF-48 to counts one\n                     and two, theft, both class D felonies. We have twenty-seven\n                     counts here, you\u2019ll have some restitution due; count one says\n                     on or about August three, ninety-nine, Tippecanoe County,\n                     State of Indiana, Thomas A. Dexter did knowingly or\n                     intentionally exert unauthorized control over the property of\n                     that of Meijer\u2019s merchandise which was sixty-nine dollars\n                     and seventy cents with the intent to deprive the other person\n                     of the value or use of that property. Are you guilty or not\n                     guilty of count one?\n\n      [Dexter]:      Guilty.\n\n                                            5\n\f       [Court]:      Okay, count two information of theft; on or about August 3,\n                     nine-nine, Tippecanoe County, State of Indiana, Thomas A.\n                     Dexter did knowingly or intentionally exert unauthorized\n                     control over the property of another person, Meijer\n                     merchandise for sixty-five dollars and seventy-one cents with\n                     the intent to deprive the other person of the value or use of\n                     that property. Guilty or not guilty?\n\n       [Dexter]:     Guilty.\n\nId. Next, the prosecutor questioned Dexter under oath to further establish the factual\n\nbasis for the crimes. The court accepted Dexter\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to a term\n\nof four years, all suspended to probation. The court further directed Dexter to serve one\n\nyear of house arrest and to make restitution for the bad checks. When asked by the court,\n\nDexter agreed that he was capable of working and could pay the amount of restitution.\n\nHe did not appeal. Dexter later paid the required amount of restitution.\n\n       Dexter has served his sentence, but he is incarcerated on other convictions. One of\n\nDexter\u2019s theft convictions was subsequently used to support a determination that he is a\n\nhabitual offender.\n\n       In March 2012, Dexter, by counsel, filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The\n\npost-conviction court denied Dexter\u2019s petition after a hearing, determining: (1) laches\n\nbarred Dexter\u2019s petition; and (2) Dexter\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was knowing and\n\nvoluntary. Dexter obtained new post-conviction counsel, and this appeal followed.\n\n                               DISCUSSION AND DECISION\n\n       A post-conviction proceeding is not a substitute for an appeal and does not provide\n\na petitioner with a \u201csuper-appeal.\u201d Reed v. State, 856 N.E.2d 1189, 1194 (Ind. 2006).\n\n\n                                            6\n\fThe post-conviction rules contemplate a narrow remedy for subsequent collateral\n\nchallenges to convictions. Id. When appealing the denial of post-conviction relief, the\n\npetitioner stands in the position of one appealing from a negative judgment. Mauricio v.\n\nState, 941 N.E.2d 497, 498 (Ind. 2011). To prevail on appeal, the petitioner must show\n\nthat the evidence as a whole leads unerringly and unmistakably to a conclusion opposite\n\nto that reached by the post-conviction court. Id.\n\n                               I. WAIVER OF COUNSEL\n\n       Dexter claims his waiver of his right to counsel at the guilty plea hearing was\n\ninvalid because he believes the trial court had previously wrongfully denied his request\n\nfor a public defender. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article\n\n1, section 13 of the Indiana Constitution both guarantee a criminal defendant the right to\n\ncounsel. See Jewell v. State, 957 N.E.2d 625, 628, 633 (Ind. 2011). A defendant\u2019s right\n\nto counsel arises at any point during a criminal case in which the absence of counsel\n\nwould erode the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Hopper v. State, 957 N.E.2d 613, 616\n\n(Ind. 2011). The entry of a guilty plea is a critical stage, and a voluntary and intelligent\n\nwaiver of counsel is required for a defendant proceeding pro se. Id. Whether a waiver is\n\nvoluntary and intelligent will depend upon an array of case-specific factors. Id. at 619.\n\nThese factors include: (1) the extent of the court\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s decision,\n\n(2) other evidence in the record that establishes whether the defendant understood the\n\ndangers and disadvantages of self-representation, (3) the background and experience of\n\nthe defendant, and (4) the context of the defendant\u2019s decision to proceed pro se. Id. at\n\n618.\n\n                                             7\n\f          On the day of Dexter\u2019s guilty plea hearing, he read and signed an advisement that\n\nthoroughly described his rights and the consequences of his guilty plea, as set forth\n\nabove. The advisement specifically explained Dexter\u2019s right to counsel and established\n\nthat the signer was waiving the right to counsel with an understanding of the\n\nconsequences of waiver and proceeding pro se. At the guilty plea hearing, the trial court\n\nquestioned Dexter as to whether he had understood the advisement of rights and waiver\n\nof the right to counsel, and Dexter agreed that he had. The trial court further questioned\n\nDexter to establish that he understood the array of rights he was waiving by pleading\n\nguilty.     Dexter was twenty-two years of age when he pleaded guilty, and he had\n\ncompleted high school. His mother asserted at the post-conviction hearing that Dexter\n\nhas attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorders, but there is no evidence that those\n\nconditions prevented him from understanding his rights and the consequences of his\n\nwaiver of the right to counsel. This was Dexter\u2019s first criminal case, but he negotiated a\n\nplea agreement with the State that resulted in the dismissal of twenty-five other charges.\n\n          Dexter does not contend that the advisements he reviewed and signed were\n\ninadequate or that the trial court failed to adequately inquire into his decision to plead\n\nguilty. Instead, he says his waiver was invalid because the trial court had, in his opinion,\n\nwrongfully denied his request for counsel at two previous hearings, and he saw little\n\npoint in making a third request at his guilty plea hearing.\n\n          We conclude the trial court did not deny Dexter\u2019s requests for counsel. At the\n\ninitial hearing, the trial court indicated Dexter should make a good-faith effort to hire\n\nprivate counsel before asking for publicly-appointed counsel.        At the May 5, 2000\n\n                                              8\n\fhearing, Dexter conceded he had made no effort to hire a private attorney, so the trial\n\ncourt again directed him to seek private counsel before requesting a public defender. The\n\ncourt\u2019s requirement was reasonable under the circumstances because Dexter was\n\nemployed. Indeed, Dexter did not dispute that he could have sought a higher-paying job\n\nor a second job, stating at the post-conviction hearing, \u201cSince I did have a job I didn\u2019t\n\nthink I needed two jobs to have an attorney or a public defender.\u201d PCR Tr. p. 32. Thus,\n\nhe merely disagreed with the trial court\u2019s request to raise funds through other avenues\n\nbefore seeking a public defender. Finally, the advisements Dexter read and signed at the\n\nguilty plea hearing provided that he was still entitled to the assistance of counsel at public\n\nexpense if he could prove a need for a public defender.\n\n       Dexter\u2019s claim that he saw no point in asking for a public defender on the basis of\n\nthe trial court\u2019s past requirements to seek private counsel is a request to reweigh the\n\nevidence, which we may not do.         There is sufficient evidence to sustain the post-\n\nconviction court\u2019s determination that Dexter validly waived his right to counsel. See\n\nHopper, 957 N.E.2d at 621 (determining, based upon the terms of Hopper\u2019s plea\n\nagreement and his colloquy with the trial court at the guilty plea hearing, that Hopper\u2019s\n\nwaiver of counsel was voluntary and intelligent).\n\n                                        II. LACHES\n\n       Dexter argues the post-conviction court erred in determining that his petition was\n\nbarred by the doctrine of laches. The post-conviction court determined, and we have\n\naffirmed, that Dexter\u2019s challenge to the validity of his waiver of the right to counsel must\n\nfail. Consequently, the question of laches is moot. See Douglas v. State, 510 N.E.2d\n\n                                              9\n\f682, 683 (Ind. 1987) (determining that laches was \u201cof no legal consequence\u201d because\n\nDouglas\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief was without merit in any event).\n\n        III. EFFECTIVENESS OF POST-CONVICTION HEARING COUNSEL\n\n       Dexter contends his post-conviction hearing counsel was ineffective because\n\ncounsel should have presented another claim instead of, or in addition to, the claim\n\ncounsel presented at the hearing.\n\n       There is no constitutional right to counsel in post-conviction proceedings under\n\neither the federal or state constitutions. Hill v. State, 960 N.E.2d 141, 145 (Ind. 2012).\n\nAccordingly, when considering the performance of post-conviction counsel, our Supreme\n\nCourt has explicitly declined to apply the well-known test (known as the Strickland\n\nstandard) for judging the performance of trial and direct appeal counsel. Id. Instead,\n\ncourts judge post-conviction counsel by a lesser standard based on principles of due\n\nprocess of law. Baum v. State, 533 N.E.2d 1200, 1201 (Ind. 1989). Specifically, we\n\nmust determine whether post-conviction counsel appeared and represented the petitioner\n\nin a procedurally fair setting which resulted in a judgment of the court. Matheney v.\n\nState, 834 N.E.2d 658, 663 (Ind. 2005).\n\n       In this case, an attorney (not Dexter\u2019s current post-conviction counsel) filed\n\nDexter\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief and requested that Dexter be transported to the\n\npost-conviction hearing. That attorney also appeared at the post-conviction hearing and\n\npresented evidence and argument in support of Dexter\u2019s claim that his waiver of counsel\n\nwas not knowing and intelligent.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       Dexter asserts his post-conviction hearing counsel should have also argued that the\n\nState failed to establish a factual basis for the counts of theft at his guilty plea hearing,\n\nand counsel\u2019s failure to do so amounted to \u201cabandonment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. p. 1.\n\nIf we were discussing an allegation that an attorney had failed to raise a claim on direct\n\nappeal, we would apply the well-established standard requiring a claimant \u201cto show from\n\nthe information available in the trial record or otherwise known to appellate counsel that\n\nappellate counsel failed to present a significant and obvious issue and that this failure\n\ncannot be explained by any reasonable strategy.\u201d Carter v. State, 929 N.E.2d 1276, 1278\n\n(Ind. 2010). However, post-conviction counsel is not evaluated under such a standard.\n\nAn attorney\u2019s presentation of some claims instead of others at a post-conviction hearing\n\ndoes not amount to abandonment of the petitioner and does not deprive a petitioner of a\n\nprocedurally fair hearing. See Graves v. State, 823 N.E.2d 1193, 1197 (Ind. 2005)\n\n(determining that post-conviction counsel did not abandon Graves because he appeared at\n\nthe post-conviction hearing and presented evidence in support of Graves\u2019s claim); cf.\n\nTaylor v. State, 882 N.E.2d 777, 784 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008) (determining that Taylor was\n\neffectively abandoned by post-conviction counsel because counsel appeared at the post-\n\nconviction hearing but presented no evidence in support of Taylor\u2019s claims).\n\n       Furthermore, our review of the record reveals that a factual basis for Dexter\u2019s\n\ncrimes was established at the guilty plea hearing. At the time of Dexter\u2019s crime, theft\n\nwas defined as the act of knowingly or intentionally exerting unauthorized control over\n\nproperty of another person, with intent to deprive the other person of any part of its value\n\nor use. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-43-4-2 (1985). Furthermore, pursuant to Indiana Code section\n\n                                             11\n\f35-43-4-4(e) (1985), a person who has insufficient funds in an account and who draws a\n\ncheck on the account to pay for property may be inferred to have intended to deprive the\n\nowner of any property acquired by making, drawing, or uttering the check for payment of\n\na part of the value of that property. Finally, in a prosecution for theft arising from a\n\ndefendant\u2019s payment by check from an account with insufficient funds, it is a defense if\n\nthe person pays the amount due, with protest fees, within ten days of receiving notice that\n\nthe check has not been paid. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-43-4-5(b) (1985).\n\n       In this case, Dexter points out that at the guilty plea hearing he denied knowing\n\nthat the checks would not clear the bank when he wrote them at Meijer, concluding that\n\nthe State therefore failed to establish a factual basis as to all elements of the offenses.\n\nHowever, Dexter also pleaded guilty under oath to both charges after the trial court\n\nadvised him that pleading guilty was an acknowledgement of the truth of each element of\n\nthe crimes and read to him each element of the charges against him. Furthermore, Dexter\n\nadmitted that he later found out that his checks did not clear the bank, but he did not pay\n\nback the amounts within ten days. This is sufficient information to establish a factual\n\nbasis for both charges, and post-conviction hearing counsel cannot be faulted for\n\npursuing a different claim.\n\n       Dexter argues this Court should grant him relief on his claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of post-conviction counsel because, if we determine that the claim is without\n\nmerit, he will simply file another petition for post-conviction relief raising the same\n\nclaim. He cites Popplewell v. State, 495 N.E.2d 189 (Ind. 1986), in support of his claim\n\nthat he may file multiple petitions for post-conviction relief. In that case, Popplewell\n\n                                            12\n\ffiled a second petition for post-conviction relief after the first petition was denied. On\n\nappeal from the denial of the second petition, our Supreme Court determined that further\n\nproceedings were necessary. Id. at 192. However, after our Supreme Court issued\n\nPopplewell, it amended the Indiana Post-Conviction Rules to establish a new procedure\n\nfor successive petitions. See Ind. Post-Conviction Rule 1(12). Once a petition for post-\n\nconviction relief has been litigated and the process is at an end, if a petitioner wants to\n\nfile another petition, he or she must seek permission from the appropriate appellate court.\n\nSee Bellamy v. State, 765 N.E.2d 520, 522 (Ind. 2002) (stating successive petitions for\n\npost-conviction relief must follow the process established by rule).\n\n       Dexter\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel must fail.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\nBAILEY, J., and BRADFORD, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f",
