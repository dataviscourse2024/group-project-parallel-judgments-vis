None of her contentions have merit. We\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n         1   Further statutory citations are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n\n                                                               1\n\f                              BACKGROUND\n      The facts of D.M.\u2019s offense are from the probation report. On May 4,\n2019, 17-year-old D.M. was \u201chome alone feeling \u2018bored\u2019 and wanted to go to a\nfriend\u2019s house. She thought her father had left his car keys at home for her to\nuse but when she looked for them, she could not find them. She texted with\nher father about getting the keys to the car. When she realized her father\nwas not leaving the funeral he was attending to bring her the keys, she\nbecame frustrated and texted stating she was going to \u2018hotwire\u2019 his \u2018fucking\ntruck.\u2019 The minor followed through with attempting to hotwire her father\u2019s\ntruck, causing damage.\u201d D.M.\u2019s father estimated the damage to the ignition\nwould cost approximately $1,000 to repair.\n      On May 16, 2019, a detective updated D.M.\u2019s mother on a case in which\nD.M. was identified as a victim of human trafficking. D.M.\u2019s mother said her\ndaughter had been missing for several days. The detective discovered that\nD.M. had posted an ad on a Web site called \u201cmegapersonals.com\u201d and, posing\nas a prospective john, arranged to meet her for a \u201cdate\u201d at a hotel in San\nFrancisco. D.M. was detained at the hotel that evening and booked into the\nNapa County Juvenile Justice Center. She smelled of marijuana and\nadmitted using marijuana daily.\n      D.M.\u2019s mother told the probation officer that D.M. had been trafficking\nherself since November 2018. \u201cAs a result, the minor has failed to come\nhome.\u201d The mother tried to get D.M. into counseling, but D.M. left after 10\nminutes \u201cbecause it made her feel bad about herself.\u201d Both parents wanted\nD.M. detained for her own safety \u201cas she is beyond their control.\u201d D.M.\u2019s\nmother expressed concern that D.M. was a flight risk. \u201c[S]he will take her\nmoney and fake identification and leave.\u201d The mother was \u201cdesperate for\nintervention and services\u201d for her daughter.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f      During her initial days of detention D.M. argued with staff and was\ndisruptive \u201cas she does not believe she belongs in Juvenile Hall.\u201d\n      The Napa County District Attorney filed a petition under section 602\nalleging one count of vandalism over $400 and one count of attempted auto\ntheft, both felonies. At the May 21, 2019 detention hearing, D.M. asked for\nrelease on home detention subject to GPS monitoring. The prosecutor\nopposed release. \u201cWe think that\u2019s in the best interests of the minor and the\npublic. In this case she was in the process of stealing her parents\u2019 car to go to\nSan Francisco. She was involved in human trafficking. The parents are\npresent and they indicate they cannot control her. They have concerns over\nher safety. . . . She is unruly and while in the hall she\u2019s having problems.\u201d\n      D.M.\u2019s father confirmed the prosecutor\u2019s statements. \u201cThe human\ntraffic side of it, she\u2019s going to end up dead, raped, beat up. And we can\u2019t\ncontrol her. We think she needs a major, major time out. We love her with\nall our heart. She has all the support of us, her aunts, uncles, and her\nbrother. . . . [\u00b6] At this point we can\u2019t control her. We love her. I would love\nfor her to be at home with us today, but I don\u2019t want her to die.\u201d\n      The court found D.M.\u2019s placement in her parents\u2019 home would be\ncontrary to her welfare and that reasonable efforts were made to eliminate\nthe need for removal. A readiness conference and contested jurisdictional\nhearing were set for June 5 and 6, and, \u201cto check in,\u201d an uncontested hearing\nwas set for May 29.\n      On May 29, 2019, D.M., her parents, the probation officer and all\ncounsel were in court for the uncontested hearing. The court, counsel and the\nprobation officer had an unreported chambers discussion. When they\nreturned, the court granted the prosecutor\u2019s request to \u201cadvise the parents\nwhat we talked about\u201d and a discussion was held off the record without\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fobjection. The court then informed the prosecutor and defense counsel \u201cthat I\nsigned a search warrant related to this matter yesterday just so when you see\nmy name on it with respect to a telephone.\u201d Defense counsel responded,\n\u201cOkay.\u201d The court said, \u201cOkay. No reason why I can\u2019t be fair and impartial.\u201d\n      D.M.\u2019s attorney advised the court that the parties had reached an\nagreement for D.M. to admit the vandalism charge (count 1) in exchange for\ndismissal of auto theft (count 2). Following advisements, D.M. admitted to\nfelony vandalism. The court dismissed count 2, found that D.M. came within\nsection 602, and set a disposition hearing for June 12.\n      On June 10, 2019, the probation officer filed a disposition and a section\n790 report.2 D.M. had been involved in human trafficking for approximately\none year. She said she sought opportunities to traffic herself because she was\nattracted to the \u201cfast money\u201d and did not view what she was doing as\nprostitution. She was upset when she was booked into juvenile hall because\nshe felt her independence was being taken away \u201cas she has been successful\nup to this point in living two separate lives.\u201d She would anger quickly when\nshe did not get her way, \u201cand will demonstrate that anger by yelling\nprofanities and refusing to cooperate with whatever is being asked of her.\u201d\nHowever, her attitude and participation in programming and groups had\nimproved.\n      The probation department reported that D.M. was at a high risk of\nreoffense and ineligible for probation under section 654.2 or 725,\nsubdivision (a), because her offense was a felony. Her high-risk behavior\nmade her unsuitable for deferred entry of judgment under section 790\nbecause she could not be detained for probation violations on the program,\n\n\n      2  The report is titled \u201cWIC 654.2 Evaluation Report,\u201d but the probation\nofficer explained at the hearing that \u201cit was a dispo and 790 report.\u201d\n\n\n                                       4\n\f\u201cwhich is necessary in supporting her physical safety should she continue to\nbe placed, or place herself, in these dangerous situations.\u201d Probation\nrecommended formal supervision with GPS monitoring, electronic search and\nother conditions.\n      The disposition hearing was held on June 12, 2019. D.M. asked the\ncourt to reduce the vandalism offense from a felony to a misdemeanor and\ngrant deferred entry of judgment. The prosecutor argued there were no\nmitigating factors to support the request to reduce the offense and suggested\nD.M. could earn the reduction through good behavior in the coming months.\nThe probation officer advised against deferred entry of judgment because only\nwith formal probation could the court impose the intensive probation\nsupervision D.M. required.\n      The court summarized a \u201cbrief conversation in chambers prior to this\nhearing at which [the probation officer] disclosed to the Court and counsel\nthat there was an incident at Juvenile Hall\u201d that involved D.M. passing a\nnote that led to a fight. The incident did not change the probation\ndepartment\u2019s recommendation.\n      The court denied D.M.\u2019s request to reduce the felony to a misdemeanor,\nagreed to revisit the issue in six months, and denied the request for non-\nwardship probation. \u201cBased upon not just the allegations of the damage to\nthe car but the other circumstances that are set forth in the report . . . , I\nthink it\u2019s very important for Probation to have all the tools at its disposal to\nhelp [D.M.]. The Court is concerned with 725 Diversion, if it were to reduce\nthe felony to a misdemeanor now, because I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a long enough\ntime. As you know, the purpose of the juvenile program is to keep minors\nsafe and to rehabilitate them, and I think we really need the time to do that\nagain, and all the tools.\u201d The court also denied the request for delayed entry\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fof judgment. D.M. was declared a ward of the court and placed on formal\njuvenile probation.\n      This appeal is timely.3\n                                     DISCUSSION\nI.    D.M. forfeited her claim the case should have proceeded under\n      section 601.\n      D.M. contends the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by filing a petition\nunder section 602 rather than section 601, and that the juvenile court erred\nby permitting the matter to proceed as a delinquency case under section 602.\nThese contentions are unavailing.\n      In re W.B. (2012) 55 Cal.4th 30, 42, explains the relevant difference\nbetween delinquency petitions based upon section 601 and section 602: \u201cIn\nCalifornia, the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over a minor can be invoked . . . by\na delinquency petition, which accuses the child of either disobedience or\ntruancy (\u00a7 601) or the violation of a law that defines a crime (\u00a7 602). . . .\n[\u00b6] Allegations that a minor refuses to obey orders of a parent or guardian, is\nbeyond parental control, violates age-based curfew ordinances, or is truant or\ndisobedient in school, must be brought in a petition filed under section 601.\n[Citation.] These allegations . . . are commonly called \u2018status offenses\u2019\nbecause they address conduct that is not criminal but is nevertheless subject\nto punishment because of the offender\u2019s status as a person under age 18.\n[Citations.] Strictly speaking, \u2018[a]n adjudication under section 601 neither\nrequires nor implies a finding of \u201cdelinquency.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n      3 On April 10, 2020, this court denied D.M.\u2019s motion to consolidate this\nappeal with a second appeal arising from the same proceedings, No. A159362.\nHer accompanying request that the court addressing the second appeal take\njudicial notice of the entire record in the first appeal will be decided in case\nNo. A159362.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f       On the other hand, \u201c[s]ection 602 confers broad juvenile court\njurisdiction over allegations that the minor\u2019s conduct \u2018violates any law.\u2019 \u201d It\nextends to offenses that, like purchasing tobacco products or underage\ndrinking, can only be committed by a minor, as well as acts that would be\ncriminal if committed by an adult. (In re W.B., supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 42\u2013\n43.) \u201cHowever, in juvenile court, a minor is not designated as a \u2018defendant,\u2019\nnor accused of a \u2018crime,\u2019 even though the allegation would describe a crime in\nadult court. [Citation.] The determination whether a minor has violated a\ncriminal provision is made solely in order to establish that the juvenile court\nhas jurisdiction. Once this determination is made, the juvenile court can\ndeclare the minor a ward of the court and order a disposition that will\naddress the minor\u2019s behavior.\u201d (Id. at p. 43.)\n       D.M. argues, in essence, that \u201cthe juvenile court sat passively by\u201d while\nthe prosecutor improperly colluded with her parents to charge her under\nsection 602 with two \u201cpretextual\u201d felonies \u201cin order to justify incarceration\nintended as a substitute for effective parental control.\u201d The claim is not\nproperly before us because D.M. failed to raise it before the juvenile court.\n\u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that arguments not raised in the trial court are forfeited on\nappeal.\u2019 \u201d (Sander v. Superior Court (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 651, 670.)\nContrary to D.M.\u2019s suggestion, her request for deferred entry of judgment\nduring the disposition phase of the proceedings is no substitute for a timely\nobjection or demurrer addressed to the decision to charge her under section\n602.\n       In any event, the claim is meritless. The section 602 petition was\nauthorized because D.M. was charged with two felonies, one of which she\nadmitted. Nothing in our review of the record substantiates her claim that\nthe prosecutor, with or without her parents\u2019 collusion, filed the felony charges\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\fas a pretext to punish her for trafficking herself in order to end-run around\nthe Legislature\u2019s exclusion of juveniles from our statutes criminalizing\nprostitution. Nor does the record back up her claim that the prosecutor\n\u201cused\u201d her parents or misled them to believe he was their personal attorney.\nFinally, D.M.\u2019s assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard\nfails with her claim of error. She can show neither that competent counsel\nwould have objected to proceeding under section 602 nor that such an\nobjection would have prevailed. (See Strickland v. Washington (1984) 466\nU.S. 668, 687\u2013688.)\nII.   Denial of Requests for Non-wardship Probation and Deferred\n      Entry of Judgment\n      D.M. next contends the juvenile court erred when it denied her\nrequests to impose non-wardship probation under section 725 or deferred\nentry of judgment under section 790. These contentions also lack merit.\n      With specified exceptions, section 725, subdivision (a) allows the court\nto place a truant or delinquent minor on informal probation for up to six\nmonths without adjudging him or her a ward of the court.4 Section 654.3 lists\nthe circumstances of ineligibility for non-wardship supervision, including\n\u201c[t]he minor is alleged to have committed a felony offense when the minor\nwas at least 14 years of age.\u201d (\u00a7 654.3, subd. (h); see \u00a7 725, subd. (a).) D.M.\nacknowledged that she committed a felony, and her request to reduce it to a\n\n      4 It provides: \u201cIf the court has found that the minor is a person\ndescribed by Section 601 or 602, by reason of the commission of an offense\nother than any of the offenses set forth in Section 654.3, it may, without\nadjudging the minor a ward of the court, place the minor on probation, under\nthe supervision of the probation officer, for a period not to exceed six months.\nThe minor\u2019s probation shall include the conditions required in Section 729.2\nexcept in any case in which the court makes a finding and states on the\nrecord its reasons that any of those conditions would be inappropriate.\u201d\n(\u00a7 725, subd. (a).)\n\n\n                                        8\n\fmisdemeanor was denied, a ruling D.M. does not challenge on appeal. She\nwas therefore ineligible for non-wardship probation under section 725,\nsubdivision (a).\n      D.M.\u2019s assertion the court erred when it denied her request for deferred\nentry of judgment is also meritless. \u201cThe DEJ provisions of section 790\net seq. . . . provide that in lieu of jurisdictional and dispositional hearings, a\nminor may admit the allegations contained in a section 602 petition and\nwaive time for the pronouncement of judgment. Entry of judgment is\ndeferred. After the successful completion of a term of probation, on the\nmotion of the prosecution and with a positive recommendation from the\nprobation department, the court is required to dismiss the charges. The\narrest upon which judgment was deferred is deemed never to have occurred,\nand any records of the juvenile court proceeding are sealed.\u201d (Martha C. v.\nSuperior Court (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 556, 558 (Martha C.).)\n      Here, it is undisputed that D.M. was eligible under the statutory\nrequirements for deferred entry of judgment. But eligibility does not\ndetermine suitability. Once eligibility is established, the court must make an\nindependent determination of the minor\u2019s suitability after consideration of\nthe factors specified in section 791, subdivision (b), \u201cwith the exercise of\ndiscretion based upon the standard of whether the minor will derive benefit\nfrom \u2018education, treatment, and rehabilitation\u2019 rather than a more restrictive\ncommitment.\u201d (In re Sergio R. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 597, 607; Martha C.,\nsupra, 108 Cal.App.4th at p. 562.) Suitability factors include the minor\u2019s age,\nmaturity, educational background, family relationships, motivation, any\ntreatment history, and any other factors relevant to the determination of\nwhether the minor is a person who would be benefited by education,\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\ftreatment, or rehabilitation. (\u00a7 791, subd. (b); In re Sergio R., at p. 607.) We\nreview the denial of deferred entry of judgment for abuse of discretion. (Ibid.)\n      There was no abuse of discretion here. D.M. was a victim of human\ntrafficking \u201cand appears to be deeply imbedded in that lifestyle.\u201d Probation\nreported she was \u201centrenched in trafficking behavior and substance use\nwithout concern for her own safety placing her at significant risk.\u201d She was\nattracted to the \u201cfast money,\u201d which she used for drugs and rent in San\nFrancisco; felt she had control over her situation; and did not plan to stop her\ndangerous behaviors.\n      Further, \u201cthe underlying issues surrounding [D.M.\u2019s] admitted anger,\ndefiance and substance use is [sic] alarming. Information revealed within\nthis investigation indicate [sic] the minor has demonstrated an increase in\ndefiant and disrespectful behavior at home. Her parents\u2019 attempts to redirect\nand establish boundaries have had little effect in motivating behavior change\nfor the minor. Despite her parents\u2019 intervention, the minor has increased her\nuse of marijuana and the unsafe behavior of leaving her parents\u2019 home\nwithout their permission for days at a time. In addition, her defiance and\nrunaway behavior led her mother to conclude she had another place to live\nand ultimately found out the minor was renting and staying at an apartment\nin San Francisco when she left the family home.\u201d\n      D.M.\u2019s behaviors, attitude and drug use placed her at high risk of\nreoffense, but on deferred entry of judgment the probation department would\nbe powerless to detain her if she violated probation and \u201ccontinue[d] to be\nplaced, or place herself, in those dangerous situations.\u201d The probation officer\ntherefore advised against deferred entry of judgment.\n      In sum, all indications were that without the structure afforded by\nprobation following entry of judgment, it was highly likely that D.M. would\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\fcontinue to defy her parents and return to the trafficking and drug use that\nthreatened to derail any chance she had for rehabilitation. It was well within\nthe court\u2019s discretion on this record to find she was unamenable to education,\ntreatment, or rehabilitation without the full coercive authority available\nunder formal wardship. (See Martha C., supra, 108 Cal.App.4th at p. 562.)\nTo the extent D.M. asserts the court failed to appropriately consider the\nsuitability factors or make express findings on them at the hearing (see \u00a7 791,\nsubd. (b)), she is mistaken. The suitability factors were addressed in the\nprobation report; nothing in the record suggests the court disregarded them;\nand neither the statute nor case law requires the juvenile court to make\nexpress findings on a minor\u2019s unsuitability for deferred entry of judgment.\nIII.   Chambers Conferences and Ex Parte Warrant Application\n       Finally, D.M. argues reversal is required because there was no court\nreporter present for the two chambers conferences or the ex parte search\nwarrant application the court disclosed to counsel and, although D.M.\u2019s\nattorney was present at the chambers conferences, she and her parents were\nnot. In her view, as a matter of constitutional law \u201c[e]ach record of a juvenile\ndelinquency case should . . . be complete, gavel to gavel.\u201d\n       These claims are also forfeited by D.M.\u2019s failure to assert them before\nthe juvenile court. \u201cA constitutional right, or a right of any other sort, may be\nforfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely\nassertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.\u201d\n(People v. Trujillo (2015) 60 Cal.4th 850, 856.) D.M. failed to object to the\njuvenile court procedures she now asserts violated her rights, and the record\nreveals no compelling reason for this court to address them despite the\nresulting forfeiture.\n                                  DISPOSITION\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                       11\n\f                                 _________________________\n                                 Siggins, P.
