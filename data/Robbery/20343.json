After pleading true\r\nto the enhancement paragraph, he was sentenced to 15 years confinement.  Presenting\r\na sole issue, appellant asserts the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress\r\nevidence based on lack of probable cause to search the locked gas compartment of his\r\nvehicle.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\tThe testimony presented at the motion to suppress hearing established the following\r\nfacts.  While on patrol one evening, Officer Jeffrey Coffey stopped appellant because his\r\ncar displayed blue turn signals in violation of the Transportation Code.  See Tex. Transp.\r\nCode Ann. \u00a7 547.324(d) (Vernon 1999).  Appellant was accompanied by an adult\r\npassenger in the front seat and a young child in the back seat.  Coffey approached the\r\ndriver's side and asked appellant for his driver's license and insurance card; he had\r\nneither.  A check revealed no outstanding warrants and that appellant possessed a Texas\r\nidentification card, but no Texas driver's license.  While in the process of issuing a citation\r\nto appellant, Officer Coffey approached the passenger's side of the car to determine if the\r\npassenger could take custody of the vehicle once the stop was completed.     \r\n\r\n\tInitially, the passenger gave a false name.  He quickly admitted doing so and was\r\narrested for failure to identify himself and placed in the back of the patrol car.  Appellant\r\nand the child in the back seat were asked to exit the car to conduct a search incident to the\r\npassenger's arrest.  Coffey began with a search of the driver's side and, as he proceeded\r\naround the rear of the vehicle to the passenger's side, observed a \"tiny bit\" of a plastic\r\nbaggie in the crease around the gas cap compartment located on the rear driver's side.\r\n\r\n\tBelieving he had probable cause, Coffey entered the car and pulled the release\r\nlever to disengage the gas cap cover without appellant's consent.  He observed but did not\r\nremove at that time the plastic baggie containing what appeared to be a white powder\r\nlocated inside the gas compartment.  The record at the suppression hearing does not\r\ndemonstrate when, or under what circumstances, the baggie was seized.\r\n\r\n\tPresenting a sole issue, appellant challenges the denial of his motion to suppress\r\nasserting a lack of probable cause to search the locked gas compartment.  He maintains\r\nthe search was constitutionally invalid as either a search incident to the passenger's arrest\r\nor a search pursuant to the automobile exception.  The State contends the seizure of the\r\nnarcotics was legitimate under both the automobile exception and the plain view doctrine. \r\nThe discrete question presented for our review is whether the officer had probable cause\r\nto open the locked gas cap compartment without consent or a search warrant. \r\n\r\n\tA trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress is reviewed for abuse of discretion. \r\nBalentine v. State, 71 S.W.3d 763, 768 (Tex.Cr.App. 2002).  In reviewing a trial court's\r\nruling on a motion to suppress, we afford almost total deference to the court's\r\ndetermination of historical facts when supported by the record. Guzman v. State, 955\r\nS.W.2d 85, 89 (Tex.Cr.App. 1997).  However, for mixed questions of law and fact, which\r\ndo not fall within this category, an appellate court may conduct a de novo review of the trial\r\ncourt's ruling.  Hernandez v. State, 957 S.W.2d 851, 852 (Tex.Cr.App. 1998) (citing\r\nGuzman, 955 S.W.2d at 89).  In other words de novo review applies when the facts are\r\nundisputed.  State v. Jennings, 958 S.W.2d 930, 932 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 1997, no pet.).\r\n\r\n\tWhen, as here, the trial court failed to file findings of fact, we view the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the trial court's ruling and assume the trial court made implicit\r\nfindings of fact that support its ruling as long as those findings are supported by the record. \r\nSee Carmouche v. State, 10 S.W.3d 323, 328 (Tex.Cr.App. 2000).  At a suppression\r\nhearing, the trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be\r\ngiven their testimony. State v. Ross, 32 S.W.3d 853, 855-56 (Tex.Cr.App. 2000). \r\nAdditionally, questions involving reasonable suspicion and probable cause are reviewed\r\nde novo.  See Loesch v. State, 958 S.W.2d 830, 832 (Tex.Cr.App. 1997).  Finally, if the\r\ntrial court's decision is correct on any theory of law applicable to the case, it will be\r\nsustained.  Ross, 32 S.W.3d at 855-56. \t\r\n\r\n\tA warrantless search is per se unreasonable subject only to a few specifically\r\nestablished and well-delineated exceptions.  Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 133, n.4,\r\n110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).  A search compromises the\r\nindividual interest in privacy; a seizure deprives the individual of dominion over his person\r\nor property.  Id., (citing United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80\r\nL. Ed. 2d 85 (1984)). \r\n\r\nSearch Incident to Arrest\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA search incident to arrest is limited to an arrestee's person and the area in his\r\nimmediate control to prevent him from obtaining possession of a weapon or concealing or\r\ndestroying evidence.  Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762-63, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23\r\nL. Ed. 2d 685 (1969).  In New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 459-60, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69\r\nL. Ed. 2d 768 (1981), to establish a workable rule regarding the definition of the area within\r\nan arrestee's immediate control, the Court held that when an officer makes a lawful\r\ncustodial arrest of the occupant of a vehicle, he may, contemporaneously incident to that\r\narrest, search the passenger compartment of the vehicle.  See also\u00a0State v. Ballard, 987\r\nS.W.2d 889, 892 (Tex.Cr.App. 1999).  A lawful search also includes the contents of\r\ncontainers found within the passenger compartment of the vehicle.  Belton, 453 U.S. at\r\n460-61.\r\n\r\n\tAccording to Coffey's testimony on direct examination, after the passenger was\r\narrested and placed in the patrol car, he began his search of the interior of the car on the\r\ndriver's side.  During cross-examination, Coffey indicated an intent to search the\r\npassenger's immediate wingspan.  No incriminating evidence was discovered in the interior\r\nof the car.  It was after this search that Coffey noticed the plastic baggie in the crease of\r\nthe gas cap compartment and investigated further to discover the cocaine.  Coffey testified\r\nthe gas cap compartment was located outside the vehicle on the rear driver's side. \r\nConcluding that Chimel and Belton do not validate the search of the gas cap compartment,\r\nwe next consider the automobile exception to warrantless searches.\r\n\r\nAutomobile exception\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn 1925, the Supreme Court established the automobile exception to the Fourth\r\nAmendment's warrant requirement in Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280,\r\n69 L. Ed. 543 (1925).  It held that a warrantless search of a vehicle stopped by officers with\r\nprobable cause to believe the vehicle contained contraband did not run afoul of the Fourth\r\nAmendment.  Carroll distinguished a search of dwellings or structures with a search of\r\nmovable vessels and rationalized that mobility justified a warrantless search.  Id. at 151; \r\nsee also Powell v. State, 898 S.W.2d 821, 827 (Tex.Cr.App. 1994).  The Court then\r\naddressed under what circumstances a warrantless search was reasonable and concluded\r\nprobable cause was necessary.  Carroll, 267 U.S. at 156.  \r\n\r\n\tThen, in Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970),\r\nthe Court found no distinction, given probable cause, between carrying out an immediate\r\nsearch of a vehicle without a warrant or seizing and holding the vehicle and conducting a\r\ndelayed search.  Id. at 52.  In Chambers, witnesses to an armed robbery described the\r\nvehicle, its four occupants, and some of their clothing to officers.  Id. at 44.  Shortly after\r\ndetails were broadcast over the police radio, officers stopped a vehicle answering the\r\ndescription.  The occupants were arrested and the vehicle was driven to the police station\r\nand thoroughly searched.  Id.  Evidence material to the robbery was discovered and\r\nintroduced at trial.  Id. at 45.  \r\n\r\n\tThe Supreme Court reasoned that probable cause is determined at the time of the\r\nstop and if an immediate search is valid, so too is a later search.  Id. at 51-52.  The\r\njustification to conduct a warrantless search does not vanish once the vehicle is\r\nimmobilized.  See\u00a0Michigan v. Thomas, 458 U.S. 259, 102 S. Ct. 3079, 73 L. Ed. 2d 750\r\n(1982).   \r\n\r\n\tIn 1982, the Supreme Court clarified the scope of a Carroll automobile search and\r\nheld that officers may conduct a search of a vehicle that is as thorough as a magistrate\r\ncould authorize in a warrant describing the place to be searched.  See United States v.\r\nRoss, 456 U.S. 798, 800, 102 S. Ct. 2157, 72 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1982).  Ross was stopped by\r\nofficers based on a reliable informant's tip that he was selling narcotics stored in the trunk\r\nof his car.  Id. at 801.  A warrantless search of the interior of the car revealed a bullet in the\r\nfront seat and a pistol in the glove compartment.  Ross was arrested and handcuffed. \r\nThereafter, a detective took his keys and opened the trunk of the car to reveal a closed\r\nbrown paper bag which the detective opened to discover a number of bags containing\r\nwhite powder, later determined to be heroin.  He replaced the bag, closed the trunk, and\r\ndrove the car to the police station.  In addition to the brown paper bag, a thorough search\r\nrevealed a red zippered leather pouch which contained $3,200 in cash.  Id. \r\n\r\n\tThe Court explained that the scope of a warrantless search of a vehicle is defined\r\nby the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe it\r\nmay be found.  Id. at 824.  It held that if probable cause exists to believe contraband is\r\nconcealed in a lawfully stopped vehicle, officers are justified in conducting a probing search\r\nof compartments and containers within the vehicle whose contents are not in plain view\r\nand which may conceal the object of the search.  Id. at 825. \r\n\r\n\tA different line of cases developed regarding luggage, bags, and other closed\r\ncontainers under United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, 97 S. Ct. 2476, 53 L. Ed. 2d 538\r\n(1977).  In Chadwick, federal agents had probable cause to believe that marihuana was\r\ncontained in a 200 pound padlocked footlocker being transported by train.  The locker was\r\ncarried through the train station to a waiting car.  As the defendants lifted the locker into\r\nthe trunk of the car, they were arrested.  The locker was seized, removed to a secure\r\nplace, and searched without a warrant.  Id. at 4.  The Court recognized that a person's\r\nexpectation of privacy in luggage is substantially greater than in a vehicle.  Id. at 13.  It\r\nrejected the argument that the search of the footlocker was analogous to a warrantless\r\nsearch of an automobile because it also had mobile characteristics and instead, reaffirmed\r\nthe principle that closed containers and packages may not be searched without a warrant. \r\nId.  \r\n\r\n\tThe Chadwick rule was extended to a suitcase being transported in the trunk of a\r\ncar in Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U.S. 753, 99 S. Ct. 2586, 61 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1979).  Officers\r\nreceived a tip that the defendant would be arriving at the airport with a suitcase containing\r\nmarihuana.  They observed the defendant place his suitcase in the trunk of a taxi, enter\r\nthe taxi, and drive away.  Id. at 755.  Officers pursued and stopped the taxi and seized and\r\nsearched the suitcase without a warrant.  Id.  The Court was presented with the task of\r\ndetermining whether the search of the suitcase fell under the Chadwick or\r\nChambers/Carroll rules.  Id. at 757. (1)  The Court found no justification for applying the\r\nautomobile exception and, instead, emphasized the heightened expectation of privacy in\r\npersonal luggage and concluded its presence in a car did not diminish the owner's\r\nexpectation.  Id. at 764-65.  It held the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment\r\napplied to personal luggage taken from an automobile.  Id. at 766.\r\n\r\n\tThe dichotomy presented over the years was that if probable cause existed to\r\nsearch a car, then the entire car, including any closed containers could be searched, but\r\nif probable cause existed only as to a container in a car, the container could be held but\r\nnot searched without a warrant.  Presented with the discrepancy between the Chadwick\r\nand Ross rules and the confusion for law enforcement, in California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S.\r\n565, 576, 111 S. Ct. 1982, 114 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1991), the Court revisited the different lines\r\nof cases and held the Fourth Amendment does not compel separate treatment for an\r\nautomobile search that extends only to a container within the car. \r\n\r\n\tThe Court re-examined the privacy protections of the Chadwick-Sanders line of\r\ncases and concluded any protection was minimal because more than likely a warrant\r\nwould be forthcoming to search the container that had been seized.  Id. at 575.  It\r\ninterpreted Carroll as providing one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and\r\neliminated the warrant requirement for closed containers.  Id. at 580.  That rule is that,\r\ngiven probable cause to believe the presence of contraband or evidence, officers may\r\nsearch an automobile and the containers within it without a warrant.  Id. \r\n\r\n\tThe foundation for a warrantless search of an automobile is probable cause. \r\nProbable cause has been defined as the sum total of layers of information, and not merely\r\nindividual layers and considerations, that a reasonable and prudent man acts upon.  See\r\nEstrada v. State, 154 S.W.3d 604, 609 (Tex.Cr.App. 2005).  It exists when facts and\r\ncircumstances within the officer's knowledge or about which he has reasonably trustworthy\r\ninformation are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an\r\noffense was or is being committed.  (Emphasis added).  See Torres v. State, No. PD-1322-04, 2005 WL 3310462, at *2 (Tex.Cr.App. Dec. 7, 2005). (2)  Additionally, probable cause is\r\ndetermined by the totality of the circumstances.  Amores v. State, 816 S.W.2d 407, 413\r\n(Tex.Cr.App. 1991).    \r\n\r\n\tAccording to the testimony at the suppression hearing, appellant had purchased the\r\ncar just two weeks earlier from a neighbor and had been in possession of it for one week. \r\nOfficer Coffey testified he was working with the Violent Crime Reduction Task Force and\r\nthat in his knowledge and experience, appellant was stopped in a high crime area for\r\nnarcotics. (3)  Regarding the \"tiny bit\" of a plastic baggie in the crease of the gas cap\r\ncompartment, Coffey testified his suspicion was aroused because there was no reason for\r\na baggie to be in that location.  Based on his training and experience, he knew the gas cap\r\ncompartment was an area used for concealing narcotics.  \r\n\r\n\tOn cross-examination, Coffey testified his search of the interior of the car revealed\r\nno incriminating evidence.  Additionally, he testified that neither appellant nor the\r\npassenger appeared to be under the influence.  The record establishes that no furtive\r\ngestures were made, and there was no attempt to conceal anything at the time of the stop. \r\nCoffey admitted he had nothing articulable to suspect narcotics.\r\n\r\n\tBased on Coffey's testimony that appellant was stopped in a high crime area for\r\nnarcotics and that in his experience a car's gas cap compartment is an area for concealing\r\nthem, he had probable cause to believe an offense was being committed.  We conclude\r\nthe trial court's implied findings are supported by the record and find no abuse of discretion\r\nin the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress.\r\n\r\n\tPlain View Doctrine-Gas Cap Compartment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMoreover, based on the following analysis, under the plain view doctrine, the officer\r\nhad probable cause that the plastic baggie presented  incriminating evidence.  A thorough\r\nsearch revealed only one unpublished case involving the warrantless search of a car's gas\r\ncap compartment.  See Parker v. State, No. 01-03-00365-CR, 2004 WL 909193, *2-3\r\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] Apr. 29, 2004, no pet.) (not designated for publication). (4)\r\n\r\n\tIt is well established that under certain circumstances officers may seize evidence\r\nin plain view without a warrant.  Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 465, 91 S. Ct.\r\n2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971).  Plain view alone, however, is never enough to justify the\r\nwarrantless seizure of evidence.  Id. at 468.  Two requirements must be satisfied.  They\r\nare: (1) the officer must have a prior justification or otherwise properly be in a position from\r\nwhich he can view the area, and (2) it must be immediately apparent to the officer that the\r\nitem may be evidence of a crime, contraband, or otherwise subject to seizure.  Id. at 465-70. (5)\r\n\r\n\tThe plain view doctrine involves no invasion of privacy and, thus, cannot be\r\nconsidered an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.  See Texas v.\r\nBrown, 460 U.S. 730, 738-39, 103 S. Ct. 1535, 75 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1983); Walter v. State, 28\r\nS.W.3d 538, 541 (Tex.Cr.App 2000).  If an item is in plain view, neither its observation nor\r\nits seizure involves any invasion of privacy.  Walter, 28 S.W.3d at 541.  \r\n\r\n\tIn Brown, the Court was confronted with the \"immediately apparent\" requirement\r\nand noted the phrase \"was very likely an unhappy choice of words, since it can be taken\r\nto imply that an unduly high degree of certainty as to the incriminatory character of\r\nevidence is necessary for an application of the 'plain view' doctrine.\"  460 U.S. at 741. \r\nBrown was stopped as part of a routine driver's license checkpoint.  Id. at 730.  As the\r\nofficer shined his flashlight into the car, he noticed Brown take his hand out of his right\r\npants pocket.  Between his two middle fingers he was holding an opaque, green party\r\nballoon, knotted about one-half inch from the top.  He let the balloon fall to the seat beside\r\nhis leg and reached across to open the glove compartment to look for his license.  Id.  The\r\nofficer noticed small plastic vials containing loose white powder and an open bag of party\r\nballoons in the glove compartment.  After Brown was asked to exit the vehicle, the officer\r\npicked up the green party balloon and noticed a powdery substance within the tied-off\r\nportion.  After Brown was arrested, the officers discovered other contraband.  Id.\r\n\r\n\tThe Court of Criminal Appeals concluded the officer had to know that \"incriminating\r\nevidence was before him when he seized the balloon.\"  See Brown v. State, 617 S.W.2d\r\n196, 200 (Tex.Cr.App. 1981), rev'd, 460 U.S. 730 (1983).  The Supreme Court, however,\r\nconcluded the opaque texture of the balloon was irrelevant and its distinctive character\r\nspoke volumes as to its contents, especially to the trained eye of the officer.  Brown, 460\r\nU.S. at 743.  Also, the officer testified he had knowledge that balloons tied in the manner\r\nof the one possessed by Brown were used to package narcotics.  Other evidence from\r\nBrown's car suggested he was involved in possession of contraband.  Id. at 743-44. \r\nWithout resolving whether probable cause was required to invoke the plain view doctrine,\r\nthe Court decided that what was required to satisfy the immediately apparent prong was\r\na \"practical, nontechnical\" probability that incriminating evidence was involved.  Id. at 742.\r\n\r\n\tFour years later, the Court held that probable cause is required to invoke the plain\r\nview doctrine.  See Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 326-27, 107 S. Ct. 1149, 94 L. Ed. 2d\r\n347 (1987); Joseph v. State, 807 S.W.2d 303, 308 (Tex.Cr.App. 1991).  In Hicks, a bullet\r\nwas fired through the floor of an apartment injuring a person in the apartment below. \r\nOfficers entered Hicks's apartment to search for evidence of the shooting.  One officer\r\nnoticed two sets of expensive stereo equipment that seemed out of place.  Suspecting they\r\nwere stolen, he moved some of the equipment to record the serial numbers.  He reported\r\nthe numbers to the station and was advised that a turntable had been taken in an armed\r\nrobbery.  He seized it without a warrant.  It was later determined that other serial numbers\r\nmatched stolen items and a warrant was obtained for the remaining items.\r\n\r\n\tThe trial court granted the defendant's motion to suppress and the appellate court\r\naffirmed on the basis that obtaining the serial numbers constituted an additional search\r\nunrelated to the shooting.  After the Arizona Supreme Court denied review, the State\r\npetitioned for certiorari.  The Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court's decision.  Id.\r\nat 329.  It concluded that the mere recording of the serial numbers did not constitute a\r\nseizure because it did not meaningfully interfere with Hicks's possessory interest; however,\r\nthe moving of the equipment to record the numbers did constitute a search separate and\r\napart from the search for evidence in the shooting.  Id. at 324-25.  Taking action by moving\r\nthe equipment which exposed to view concealed portions of the apartment or its contents\r\nproduced a new invasion of privacy unrelated to the prior justification that validated the\r\nentry.  Id. at 325.  The Court noted that the distinction between looking at a suspicious\r\nobject and moving it even a few inches is \"much more than trivial for purposes of the\r\nFourth Amendment.\"  Id.  \"A search is a search\" even if it uncovers something as\r\ninsignificant as serial numbers.  Id.\r\n\r\n\tAfter concluding a search occurred, the Court examined whether it was reasonable\r\nunder the plain view doctrine.  Id. at 326.  Although the State conceded the officer only had\r\nreasonable suspicion to believe the stereo equipment was stolen, the Court noted that the\r\nhigher standard of probable cause would have sustained a seizure of the equipment under\r\nthe plain view doctrine.   The Court explained:\r\n\r\n\t[d]ispensing with the need for a warrant is worlds apart from permitting a\r\nlesser standard of cause for the seizure than a warrant would require, i.e.,\r\nthe standard of probable cause.  No reason is apparent why an object should\r\nroutinely be seizable on lesser grounds, during an unrelated search and\r\nseizure, than would have been needed to obtain a warrant for that same\r\nobject if it had been known to be on the premises.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 327.  The fact that an item comes lawfully within an officer's plain view cannot, alone,\r\nsupplant the requirement of probable cause.  Id.\r\n\r\n\tHere, Officer Coffey was lawfully in a position from which to view the tiny bit of the\r\nplastic baggie.  His prior justifications for the search were a valid traffic stop and a search\r\nincident to the passenger's arrest.  He was in the process of issuing a citation to appellant\r\nwhen he noticed the baggie conspicuously located in the crease of the gas cap\r\ncompartment.  The immediately apparent prong does not require actual knowledge by the\r\nofficer of incriminating evidence.  See Brown, 460 U.S. at 741-42.  It is not essential that\r\nthe officer's belief be correct or more likely true than false.  Id. at 742.\r\n\r\n\t  The Court of Criminal Appeals has recognized that certain objects not inherently\r\nsuspicious can become so under certain circumstances.  See generally Gonzales v. State,\r\n648 S.W.2d 684, 686 (Tex.Cr.App. 1983) (balloons containing heroin); Sullivan v. State,\r\n626 S.W.2d 58, 59 (Tex.Cr.App. 1981) (a partially unzipped pouch exposing a dark brown\r\nbottle and a clear plastic bag containing a white powder); DeLao v. State, 550 S.W.2d 289,\r\n291 (Tex.Cr.App. 1977) (a red balloon containing heroin); Duncan v. State, 549 S.W.2d\r\n730, 732 (Tex.Cr.App. 1977) (recognizing the popularity of plastic bags as containers for\r\nnarcotics, but declining to hold that the bag itself, without more, is contraband). (6) \r\nAccordingly, a plastic baggie, under suspicious circumstances, can provide probable cause\r\nto invoke the plain view doctrine. \r\n\r\n\tAs previously noted, the evidence established that appellant was stopped in a high\r\ncrime area for narcotics.  Officer Coffey, in his experience, could conceive of no other\r\nreason for a plastic baggie to be visible in the crease of the gas cap compartment other\r\nthan to conceal narcotics.  Given the facts and circumstances within his knowledge, Coffey\r\nhad probable cause to believe the plastic baggie presented evidence of a crime sufficient\r\nto satisfy the immediately apparent prong.  See\u00a0Torres, 2005 WL 3310462, at *2. \r\n\r\n\tThe act of opening the locked gas cap compartment on his own volition because he\r\nknew it was a common hiding area for narcotics is analogous to the officer in Brown\r\nknowing that balloons are frequently used to carry narcotics.  The tip of the baggie exposed\r\nin the crease of the gas cap compartment was in plain view just as the knotted balloon was\r\nin Brown.  Neither the baggie nor the balloon showed any contraband until further\r\ninvestigation based on probable cause.  We conclude that under the plain view doctrine,\r\nthe search of the gas cap compartment was constitutionally valid.  The trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to suppress.  Appellant's sole issue is\r\noverruled. \r\n\r\n\tAccordingly, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDon H. Reavis\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Justice\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nQuinn, C.J., concurs in result.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nPublish.\t\t\r\n1. Chadwick and Sanders pre-date Ross and its holding that presented with probable\r\ncause, officers may search all compartments and containers of an automobile.\r\n2. Overruling Castillo v. State, 818 S.W.2d 803 (Tex.Cr.App. 1991), to the extent it\r\nrequired both personal knowledge and reasonably trustworthy information.  (Emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n3. The record does not disclose Coffey's training nor his years of experience as a\r\npolice officer.\r\n4. The State relies on Parker, and appellant, in his reply brief, questions the reliance\r\non it and other unpublished cases.  Unpublished cases have no precedential value but may\r\nbe cited as not designated for publication.  Tex. R. App. P. 47.7.\r\n5. Under Coolidge, the plain view doctrine also required that discovery of incriminating\r\nevidence be inadvertent.  That requirement was abandoned in Horton, 496 U.S. at 139-40.\r\n6. These cases were decided before the Supreme Court's 1983 decision in Brown,\r\nwhich scaled down the \"immediately apparent\" requirement.  460 U.S. at 741-42.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
