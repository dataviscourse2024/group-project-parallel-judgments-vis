No. J12-01384)\n\n\n         Appellant Ronald F. appeals\tafter\tadmitting one count of grand theft in\ta\tjuvenile\t\nwardship\tproceeding.\t\tOn appeal, appellant contends that the court\u2019s award of\n$1,138.95 in victim restitution was unlawful because the recipient of the restitution was\nContra Costa County Risk Management, which was not a direct victim of his offense. He\nfurther contends that, even assuming the recipient was the direct victim, the court abused\nits discretion because the victim did not incur any actual losses. We shall affirm the\njuvenile court\u2019s restitution order.\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n         On October 18, 2013, a juvenile wardship petition was filed, pursuant to Welfare\nand Institutions Code section 602, subdivision (a),1 alleging that appellant, then age 16,\n\n\n         1\n        All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fhad committed robbery pursuant to Penal Code section 211. On October 23, 2013,\nappellant admitted an allegation of grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. (c)), and the\njuvenile court adjudged him a ward of the court and set a maximum term of confinement\nof three years. At the November 21, 2013 dispositional hearing, the court committed\nappellant to the Orin Allen Youth Rehabilitation Facility (OAYRF) for six months, with\nan additional 90-day conditional release/parole period. The court also imposed\nconditions of probation to be followed upon his release from commitment.\n       On December 4, 2013, the Contra Costa County Probation Department filed a\nnotice of probation violation, pursuant to section 777, for appellant\u2019s involvement in a\n\u201cphysical altercation\u201d at OAYRF. According to the probation report, the altercation\ninvolved a fight between appellant and several other minors. When OAYRF employee\nStephen Craft intervened, he fell and sustained an injury to the back of his head.\n       On December 12, 2013, appellant admitted the probation violation and, on\nDecember 27, the court extended appellant\u2019s placement at OAYRF to 12 months. The\ncourt deferred determination of the amount of restitution to \u201cvictim Stephen Craft.\u201d\n       On May 20, 2014, at the conclusion of a restitution hearing, the court found\nappellant and six other minors liable for $1,389.95 in restitution \u201cfor Victim Stephen\nCraft, reimbursable to Contra Costa County Risk Management.\u201d\n       On May 22, 2014, appellant filed a notice of appeal from the restitution order.\n                                         DISCUSSION\n       Appellant contends (1) the juvenile court\u2019s order of $1,138.95 in victim restitution\nwas unlawful because it awarded restitution to Contra Costa County Risk Management,\nwhich was not a direct victim of appellant\u2019s offense, and (2) even assuming the court did\naward the restitution directly to victim Stephen Craft, it abused its discretion because\nCraft did not incur any actual losses.\n                                I. Trial Court Background\n       In an April 15, 2014 \u201cRestitution Supplemental Report,\u201d the probation officer\nreported that the probation department had identified Stephen Craft as a victim because\nhe was injured during the incident at OAYRF. He was treated for a head injury and,\n\n\n                                             2\n\fbecause he sustained the injury while working as a probation counselor for the Contra\nCosta County Probation Department, the matter had been referred to the Contra Costa\nCounty Risk Management Department (Risk Management) for a workers\u2019 compensation\nclaim. The probation officer had contacted a claims adjuster from Risk Management,\nwho reported that the total medical bills and fees associated with Craft\u2019s injury came to\n$1,138.95\n       The probation officer further reported that he had spoken with Craft, who said that\nhe was not seeking any financial restitution for the injury. The probation department\nrecommended that restitution be set at $1,138.95, with appellant jointly and severally\nliable with five other co-responsible minors, \u201cpayable to Contra Costa County Risk\nManagement.\u201d\n       At the May 20, 2014 restitution hearing, defense counsel stated that he did not\ncontest the reasonableness of the amount of the proposed restitution order, but did not\nbelieve appellant should be required to pay the restitution because, inter alia, Risk\nManagement, which he described as \u201csort of the Worker\u2019s Compensation/insurance for\nthe County,\u201d was not the direct victim of the offense, and Craft did not suffer any\nfinancial loss. The court found \u201cthe fact that there was insurance coverage is irrelevant,\u201d\nand explained that it was \u201cordering that the victim is Mr. Craft, but the money is\nreimbursable through him to Risk Management.\u201d It then ordered restitution in the\namount of $1,138.95 \u201cfor victim Stephen Craft, reimbursable to Contra Costa County\nRisk Management.\u201d2\n                                    II. Legal Analysis\n       \u201cEnacted in 1982, Proposition 8, the \u2018Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u2019 amended the\nCalifornia Constitution to provide that \u2018all persons who suffer losses\u2019 resulting from\ncrime are entitled to \u2018restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes causing the\nlosses.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b)(13)(A).) In 1983, the Legislature enacted\n\n       2\n         The written restitution order originally listed the victim as Risk Management but,\nbefore signing the order, the court added the words, \u201cStephen Craft, reimbursable to,\u201d\nabove the Risk Management notation.\n\n\n                                              3\n\fPenal Code section 1202.4, which requires a full victim restitution order in criminal cases\nfor every determined economic loss unless there are compelling and extraordinary\nreasons not to do so. [Citation.] In 1994, the Legislature enacted section 730.6 to\nprovide \u2018parallel restitutionary requirements for juvenile offenders.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Luis\nM. v. Superior Court (2014) 59 Cal. 4th 300, 304.)\n         Section 730.6, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part: \u201cIt is the intent of the\nLegislature that a victim of conduct for which a minor is found to be a person described\nin Section 602 who incurs any economic loss as a result of the minor\u2019s conduct shall\nreceive restitution directly from that minor.\u201d (\u00a7 730.6, subd. (a)(1).) Subdivision (h) of\nsection 730.6 provides in relevant part: \u201cRestitution . . . shall be imposed in the amount\nof the losses, as determined. . . . The court shall order full restitution unless it finds\ncompelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and states them on the record. . . .\nA restitution order . . . shall be of a dollar amount sufficient to fully reimburse the victim\nor victims for all determined economic losses incurred as the result of the minor\u2019s\nconduct for which the minor was found to be a person described in Section 602, including\nall of the following: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (B) Medical expenses.\u201d (\u00a7 730.6, subd. (h)(1).)\n         \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn keeping with the [voters\u2019] \u2018unequivocal intention\u2019 that victim restitution be\nmade, statutory provisions implementing the constitutional directive have been broadly\nand liberally construed.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (In re Luis M., supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 305.) \u201cAn\norder of direct victim restitution acts to make the victim whole, rehabilitate the minor,\nand deter future delinquent behavior. [Citation.]\u201d (Ibid.; accord, In re Anthony S. (2014)\n227 Cal. App. 4th 1352, 1357.)\n         Restitution awards are generally vested in the trial court\u2019s discretion, although we\nreview an issue of law independently. (In re K.F. (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 655, 661.)\n                                               A.\n         Appellant first contends the victim restitution order was unlawful because the\njuvenile court improperly awarded restitution to a governmental entity and/or an\ninsurance company, i.e., Risk Management, rather than to the direct victim, Stephen\nCraft.\n\n\n                                                4\n\f       Appellant relies on People v. Birkett (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 226, 228-229 (Birkett), in\nwhich the California Supreme Court addressed whether the 1994 version of the adult\nrestitution statute, Penal Code section 1203.4 (now Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4), gave insurers a\nright to restitution of any amount they had paid to reimburse their policy-holders for\ncrime-related losses. The court concluded, based on the statutory language, that\nrestitution \u201cshould go entirely to the individual or entity the offender had directly\nwronged, regardless of the victim\u2019s reimbursement from other sources.\u201d (Birkett, at\np. 246.)\n       This case, however, does not involve a situation in which the juvenile court\nawarded restitution to someone other than the direct victim. Both the record and the\nrestitution order itself make clear that, following the discussion at the restitution hearing,\nthe court added Craft to the order as the direct victim and recipient of restitution, with the\ncaveat that the restitution received was reimbursable to Risk Management, which had\nalready paid Craft\u2019s medical bills. (See pt. I., ante.) Although perhaps inartfully worded\ndue to the court\u2019s stated concern that Risk Management be reimbursed for its medical\npayments on behalf of Craft, the restitution award was made to the direct victim of\nappellant\u2019s conduct\u2014Stephen Craft\u2014and not to a governmental entity or insurance\ncompany. (Compare Birkett, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 246; People v. Franco (1993) 19\nCal. App. 4th 175, 185 [defendant convicted of assaulting police officer could not be\nordered to pay restitution to city for workers\u2019 compensation benefits it had paid to injured\nofficer].)\n       The restitution order in this case is not contrary to law. (See In re K.F., supra, 173\nCal.App.4th at p. 661.)\n                                              B.\n       Appellant further contends the juvenile court abused its discretion when it\nawarded restitution to Craft because Craft did not incur any actual losses.\n       As previously discussed in part II., A., ante, our Supreme Court concluded, after\nanalyzing the language of former Penal Code section 1203.4, \u201cthat the Legislature\nintended to require a probationary offender, for rehabilitative and deterrent purposes, to\n\n\n                                              5\n\fmake full restitution for all losses his crime had caused, and that such reparation should\ngo entirely to the individual or entity the offender had directly wronged, regardless of that\nvictim\u2019s reimbursement from other sources.\u201d (Birkett, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 246.)\nSubsequently, in In re Brittany L. (2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 1381, 1389, the appellate court\nfound that the principles announced in Birkett were applicable \u201cto the virtually identical\nprovisions of section 730.6 regarding restitution orders imposed against minors.\u201d The\ncourt therefore concluded that the victims \u201cwere entitled to a restitution order in an\namount sufficient to \u2018fully reimburse\u2019 them for losses incurred as a result of appellant\u2019s\ncriminal conduct\u2014without regard to potential reimbursement from their homeowners\u2019\ninsurance carrier. A proper order thus would have included all proven losses they\nsustained, whether or not first submitted to their insurance carrier, and whether or not\nalready reimbursed by their insurer.\u201d (In re Brittany L., at p. 1389; accord, People v.\nVasquez (2010) 190 Cal. App. 4th 1126, 1133-1134 [\u201cPayments received by a crime\nvictim from his or her insurance company or from an independent third party for\neconomic losses suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct cannot reduce\nthe amount of restitution the defendant owes\u201d].)\n       The court in In re Brittany L. discussed the policy reasons for not excusing a\njuvenile offender from paying restitution where the victim has been reimbursed by an\ninsurance company: \u201cThe purpose behind requiring a minor to pay victim restitution is\nfor its deterrent as well as rehabilitative effect. \u2018Requiring the [minor] to make complete\nreparation to her victims for the harm done to them is more likely to make an impression\non the [minor] than simply imposing a statutory fine. [Citation.]\u2019 These purposes would\nbe thwarted if a minor was relieved from responsibility for making her victims whole\nsimply because the victims had been farsighted enough to purchase insurance for this\ntype of damage . . . . Moreover, the principles announced by our Supreme Court in\nPeople v. Birkett make clear, trial courts are not to consider whether the victim has been,\nor will be, reimbursed from third parties in ordering victim restitution.\u201d (In re Brittany\nL., supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1387-1388, fns. omitted; accord, e.g., In re Anthony S.,\nsupra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1360 [fortuity that victim was indigent and hospital had\n\n\n                                             6\n\fwritten off charges for his medical care as an unpaid debt did not shield minor from\nobligation of paying restitution]; In re Eric S. (2010 ) 183 Cal. App. 4th 1560, 1565 [even\nassuming victim who was a Kaiser member was not obligated to pay Kaiser any amount\nabove his membership fee, \u201ccharges were nonetheless incurred on his behalf as a result of\nappellant\u2019s criminal conduct\u201d].)\n       Likewise, in the present case, Craft is entitled to restitution despite the fact that\nRisk Management has already paid his medical expenses. Under section 730.6, appellant\nis required to \u201cfully reimburse\u201d Craft \u201cfor all determined economic losses incurred as the\nresult of [appellant\u2019s] conduct\u201d (\u00a7 730.6, subd. (h)(1)), regardless of his \u201creimbursement\nfrom other sources.\u201d (Birkett, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 246.) That Craft himself did not\nrequest restitution is immaterial since a victim cannot free a defendant from his or her\nvictim restitution obligation. (Cf. In re Tommy A. (2005) 131 Cal. App. 4th 1580, 1590-\n1591 [\u201c \u2018[a] restitution order [under section 730.6, subd. (a)(1)] pursuant to a [juvenile\noffender\u2019s admission] is an agreement between [the juvenile offender] and the state,\u2019 and\nthus a release of liability by the victim, who is not a party to the agreement, \u2018cannot act to\nrelease [the juvenile] from his financial debt to the state\u2019 as a matter of law\u201d].)\n       Appellant nonetheless argues that an award of restitution was unwarranted in this\ncase because there is no evidence that Risk Management has sought or will seek\nreimbursement from Craft. He cites In re K.F., supra, 173 Cal. App. 4th 655, 663, in\nwhich the appellate court discussed what it means for a victim to have \u201cincurred\u201d an\neconomic loss for purposes of section 730.6: \u201cTo \u2018incur\u2019 is \u2018to become liable or subject\nto: bring down upon oneself.\u2019 (Meriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1999)\np. 590.) To constitute evidence of a \u2018loss incurred,\u2019 there must be some basis to conclude\nthat the victim is \u2018liable or subject to\u2019 a charge. Where collection of the charge is barred\nby law, the victim is not liable or subject to it, and the charge is not \u2018incurred.\u2019 \u201d The\ncourt found that no such legal bar to recovery appeared in that case, although it did\nconclude that the juvenile court should not have ordered restitution for ambulance service\nrendered by the Kaiser health maintenance organization because the evidence in the\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\frecord reflected that Kaiser had not billed the victim for that expense. (In re K.F., at\npp. 663-664.)\n        Here, appellant points to no evidence in the record showing that Craft will not be\nrequired to reimburse Risk Management for the medical payments it made on his behalf\npursuant to his workers\u2019 compensation coverage, either because reimbursement is \u201cbarred\nby law\u201d or because Risk Management has made clear that it will not seek reimbursement\nfor such payments. Affirmative evidence that Risk Management intends to obtain\nreimbursement from Craft is not required for us to uphold the restitution order. (See,\nBirkett, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 246; accord, People v. Duong (2010) 180 Cal. App. 4th\n1533, 1537-1538 [\u201cthird party may pursue its civil remedies against either the perpetrator\nor the victim; the possibility that the victim may receive a windfall because the third\nparty fails to exercise its civil remedies does not diminish the victim\u2019s right to receive\nrestitution of the full amount of economic loss caused by the perpetrator\u2019s offense\u201d];\nPeople v. Hove (1999) 76 Cal. App. 4th 1266, 1272-1273 [finding restitution order proper\ndespite fact that \u201cthe victim had no direct economic losses, and even though the victim\ncould conceivably profit from recovering restitution if defendant complies with the\nrestitution order and if Medicare and/or Medic-Cal does not pursue reimbursement\u201d].)\n        There was no abuse of discretion.
