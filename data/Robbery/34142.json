The record, however, fails to establish whether the order directing exami*903nation of defendant pursuant to CPL article 730 was followed. It is not clear whether any psychiatric examinations were completed and no psychiatric evaluations were filed with the court (see, CPL 730.20 [1], [5]; People v Graham, 127. AD2d 443, 445). As the result of those substantial deviations from the statutory requirements, defendant was deprived of his right \u201cto a full and impartial determination of his mental capacity\u201d to stand trial (People v Armlin, supra, at 172; see, People v Lowe, supra, at 304). \u201cWhere a meaningful reconstruction hearing can be held, it is the proper remedy for violation of article 730\u201d (People v Bey, 144 AJD2d 972, 973). We are unable to determine from this record whether a meaningful reconstruction hearing can be held (see, People v Arnold, 113 AD2d 101, 107-108). We therefore hold the case, reserve decision and remit the matter to Monroe County Court for a hearing before a different Judge to determine whether sufficient evidence may be developed to reconstruct defendant\u2019s mental capacity at the time of trial and, if so, to determine whether defendant was competent to stand trial (see, People v Arnold, supra, at 108). (Appeal from Judgment of Monroe County Court, Maloy, J.\u2014 Burglary, 2nd Degree.) Present \u2014 Pigott, Jr., P. J., Green, Pine, Hayes and Hurlbutt, JJ.\n",
