Because Harris\u2019s underlying offense conduct led to someone\u2019s death,\nthe district court imposed a 92-month sentence\u2014well above the Sentencing\nGuidelines range of 33\u201341 months\u2014to reflect the seriousness of his actions.\nHarris argues that the district court did not adequately explain its deviation from\nthe Guidelines. Additionally, he says that in light of his exemplary post-offense\nbehavior, his lengthy sentence was greater than necessary to comply with the\n\nsentencing purposes identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). We disagree. Though\nthe district court could have chosen to impose a sentence in keeping with the\nGuidelines, the court\u2019s imposition of a higher penalty was not outside its\nsignificant discretion.\n                                          I.\n      Early one evening, for reasons unknown, Harris had a confrontation with\nTerius Gillum in the Smiley Court neighborhood of Montgomery, Alabama.\nHarris pulled out a .357 magnum revolver, which he had purchased on the street a\nfew days before, and fired at Gillum\u2019s feet. Gillum returned fire as he retreated in\nthe direction of a gang called the CBM Young-ins. Harris continued shooting\nwhile he ran in the opposite direction.\n      Predictably, the gunfight drew the attention of the nearby gang members,\nwho were standing across the street from the Money Team gang. The rival gangs\nbegan shooting and, in the ensuing gunfire, four people (including Harris) were\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f               Case: 18-15055     Date Filed: 07/01/2020   Page: 3 of 6\n\n\n\ninjured and one, Rodriquez Lamar Smith, was killed. There is no reliable evidence\nthat one of Harris\u2019s bullets killed Smith.\n\n      The United States charged Harris with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Just\na few weeks later, Harris signed a plea agreement. He and the government both\nagreed that the offense conduct was most analogous to the Guidelines offense of\naggravated assault, resulting in a sentencing range of 33\u201341 months. The\nprobation officer had a different view, and found that the appropriate cross-\nreference offense was not aggravated assault, but voluntary manslaughter. Based\n\non the offense conduct, Harris\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, and his criminal\nhistory\u2014which included adult convictions for recklessly evading arrest, theft, and\nburglary\u2014the probation officer calculated that Harris\u2019s offense level was 26 and\ncriminal-history category was IV. That equates to a Guidelines range of 92\u2013115\nmonths.\n      While indicating some disapproval of the agreement between Harris and the\ngovernment, the sentencing court ultimately went along with it. Based on that\nagreement, the court calculated an offense level of 16 with a Guidelines range of\n33\u201341 months. The government then asked for a sentence within the middle of the\nGuidelines range. Even so, expressing a belief that \u201cthe sentence is way under\nprovided for by the [G]uidelines calculation,\u201d the court imposed a 92-month\nsentence, noting that the sentence imposed was still below the statutory maximum\nof 120 months. Harris now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                 Case: 18-15055       Date Filed: 07/01/2020       Page: 4 of 6\n\n\n\n                                                II.\n         We review the reasonableness of sentencing decisions for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See United States v. Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1188 (11th Cir. 2010) (en\nbanc).\n                                               III.\n                                                A.\n         A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court commits a\nsignificant procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d or\n\n\u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d1 Gall v. United States, 552\nU.S. 38, 51 (2007). If a court imposes an above-Guidelines sentence, it should\n\u201censure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the\nvariance.\u201d Id. at 50. Major departures will require more explanation than minor\nones. See id. Still, a sentencing court is not required to \u201cstate on the record that it\nhas explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the\n\n\u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d United States v. Docampo, 573 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.\n2009) (citation omitted). And in all cases, the appealing party bears the burden of\nshowing that the district court\u2019s sentence is \u201cunreasonable in light of the record and\n\n1\n  Section 3553(a) directs the court to consider: (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\nand the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; (2) \u201cthe need for the sentence\u201d to \u201creflect\nthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d \u201cprovide just punishment for the\noffense,\u201d \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d \u201cprotect the public from further\ncrimes of the defendant,\u201d and \u201cprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational\ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner\u201d; (3) \u201cthe\nkinds of sentences available\u201d; (4) \u201cthe kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established\u201d\nfor \u201cthe applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set\nforth in the guidelines\u201d; (5) \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d; (6) \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted\nsentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\nsimilar conduct\u201d; and (7) \u201cthe need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\u201d\n\n\n                                                4\n\f               Case: 18-15055     Date Filed: 07/01/2020    Page: 5 of 6\n\n\n\nthe \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.\n2010).\n\n      The district court adequately explained its chosen sentence. First, the court\ntook into account Harris\u2019s \u201cextensive record,\u201d which included multiple convictions\nfor violent crimes. The court also emphasized that Harris started a violent\nconfrontation that led to a death: \u201che was the one who pulled out the firearm.\u201d\nFinally, the court acknowledged that it had considered Harris\u2019s salutary post-\noffense conduct. No more was needed.\n\n      Given the court\u2019s adequate explanation, we have no need to probe further.\nThe fact that Harris\u2019s 92-month sentence is at the bottom of the Guidelines range\nthat the probation officer would have applied\u2014under a sentencing scenario the\ncourt rejected\u2014does not change this calculus. And neither the sentencing court\u2019s\nverbalized skepticism of the plea agreement, nor an above-Guidelines sentence,\ninvite us to conclude that the court implicitly rejected the plea agreement that it\nexplicitly accepted.\n                                          B.\n      To find a district court\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable, we must be\n\u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear\nerror of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that\nlies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d\nIrey, 612 F.3d at 1190 (citation omitted). The defendant \u201cbears the burden of\ndemonstrating that his total sentence is unreasonable.\u201d United States v. Covington,\n565 F.3d 1336, 1346\u201347 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\n\n                                           5\n\f               Case: 18-15055     Date Filed: 07/01/2020    Page: 6 of 6\n\n\n\n      Harris argues that the court impermissibly relied on his criminal history and\nthe seriousness of the offense conduct while \u201coverlook[ing] numerous mitigating\n\ncircumstances\u201d that bear on the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. For instance, Harris says\nthat the court should have considered his marriage, four children, long-term\nemployment, and law-abiding conduct since the 2015 shooting. The first problem\nwith Harris\u2019s argument is that the district court specifically said that it considered\nthe recent turnaround in Harris\u2019s behavior. But even if we were giving his good\npost-indictment choices fresh consideration, it would not give us a \u201cdefinite and\n\nfirm conviction\u201d that Harris\u2019s sentence was more than necessary to achieve the\nsentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). The weight given to each factor is committed to the\nsentencing court\u2019s sound discretion. United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293,\n1309 (11th Cir. 2016). We cannot see how it was an abuse of discretion to give\ngreat weight to Harris\u2019s criminal history and the seriousness of the offense conduct\nwhile giving relatively less weight to his post-offense conduct.\n                                          IV.\n      We have no reason to question the evidence offered about Harris\u2019s new\napproach to life. But we also have no reason to think that the district court failed\nto apply the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, failed to adequately explain its chosen sentence, or\nfailed to choose a sentence inside the bounds of reasonableness. That means\nHarris has not shown that his sentence is procedurally or substantively\nunreasonable, so we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f",
