The panel held that,\neven assuming that petitioner\u2019s counsel should have\nrequested a plenary competency hearing, petitioner was not\nprejudiced because there was no reasonable probability that\nhe would have been found incompetent to plead guilty, given\nreports by two mental health examiners, counsel\u2019s own\nobservations of petitioner based on extensive interaction with\nhim, the observations of the prosecutor and judge, and\npetitioner\u2019s rational reasons for wanting to plead guilty.\n\n    The panel affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of\npetitioner\u2019s request for discovery and a hearing on the subject\nof the trial judge\u2019s mental competency at the re-sentencing\nhearing (after the state supreme court remanded for a new\npenalty phase hearing due to counsel\u2019s failure to present\nmitigating evidence).

Fletcher dissented. He would hold that the\ndistrict court should have granted an evidentiary hearing on\nwhether the trial judge was mentally competent when he re-\nsentenced petitioner to death. He would also hold that the\ndistrict court should have granted an evidentiary hearing on\nwhether the counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge the\ntrial judge\u2019s competence during re-sentencing.

Jacobson (argued), Deputy Attorney General for the\nState of California, San Diego, California, for Respondent-\nAppellant.\n\nMichael Satris (argued), Bolinas, California; and Diana\nSamuelson, San Francisco, California, for Petitioner-\nAppellee.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nSILVERMAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Ronald Deere threatened to kill everyone in Cindy\nGleason\u2019s family if she were ever to break up with him. On\n\f4                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nMarch 4, 1982, Deere made good on his threat. Upset that\nCindy had left him, Deere shot and killed Cindy\u2019s brother-in-\nlaw, Don Davis, and Davis\u2019s two young daughters, ages 7\nand 2.\n\n    Deere was arrested a few days later. After having been\nappointed a lawyer, he expressed his desire to withdraw his\nplea of not guilty and to plead guilty, even though he knew he\ncould face the death penalty. Before the plea was entered,\nDeere\u2019s lawyer arranged for him to be examined by two\nmental health professionals \u2013 a physician with experience in\npsychiatry, and a psychologist. Both examiners came to\nremarkably similar conclusions. Both reported that Deere\nwas oriented as to time, place and person. Neither examiner\nfound Deere to suffer from a thought disorder.\n\n    Deere told the psychologist, William Jones, Ph.D., that he\nwould prefer a death sentence to life imprisonment. He also\nsaid that the death penalty would make him feel better and\nhelp the people he hurt. He said that pleading guilty would\nprotect others who would be spared the ordeal of a trial and\nthat by pleading guilty he would protect his family from\nfurther publicity.\n\n   The physician, Tommy Bolger, M.D., a former staff\npsychiatrist in the California prison system and elsewhere,\nopined that Deere did not suffer from mental illness.\nHowever, like Dr. Jones, Dr. Bolger diagnosed Deere with\nsevere personality and substance abuse disorders. Bolger\nconcluded that Deere understood the charges against him and\nwas capable of cooperating with counsel if he wanted to.\n\n    Deere\u2019s lawyer spent countless hours with his client\nleading up to the change of plea. The lawyer attested that\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                        5\n\nDeere was fully aware of the ramifications of his decision and\nwas legally competent to plead guilty. Following a change-\nof-plea colloquy in which Deere indisputably was lucid,\nengaged, and evidenced knowledge of his situation, the trial\njudge accepted Deere\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n    In Deere\u2019s present habeas case, he argues that his lawyer\nwas ineffective in 1982 for failing to request a full-blown\ncompetency hearing. We hold today that even assuming for\nthe sake of argument that his lawyer should have requested a\nplenary competency hearing \u2013 despite the reports of the two\nmental health examiners, despite counsel\u2019s own observations\nof Deere based on his extensive interaction with him, despite\nthe observations of the prosecutor and the judge, despite\nDeere\u2019s rational reasons for wanting to plead guilty \u2013 Deere\nnevertheless suffered no prejudice from the lack of a\ncompetency hearing because there was no reasonable\nprobability that he would have been found incompetent to\nplead guilty. As we said in Dennis v. Budge, 378 F.3d 880,\n890 (9th Cir. 2004), \u201cThe question . . . is not whether mental\nillness substantially affects a decision, but whether a mental\ndisease, disorder or defect substantially affects the prisoner\u2019s\ncapacity to appreciate his options and make a rational\nchoice.\u201d Id. (Emphasis in the original) There is literally no\ncontemporaneous evidence that Deere lacked the capacity to\nunderstand his options and to make a rational decision to\naccept responsibility for what he did. All of the evidence\nsupports the trial court\u2019s findings that Deere\u2019s guilty plea was\nknowing, intelligent and competent. Those findings are\npresumed correct and have not been rebutted by clear and\nconvincing evidence. See Evans v. Raines, 800 F.2d 884, 887\n(9th Cir. 1986).\n\f6                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n    In 1986, after Deere\u2019s case had been remanded by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court for the presentation of mitigating\nevidence and re-sentencing, Deere once again appeared\nbefore Superior Court Judge Fred Metheny. At that time,\nneither Deere\u2019s own lawyer, nor the lawyer specially\nappointed as a friend-of-the-court to present mitigation on\nDeere\u2019s behalf, nor the prosecutor, nor any reviewing court\nexpressed any concern whatsoever about Judge Metheny\u2019s\nmental competence. Five years later, in reviewing the\ntranscript of Judge Metheny\u2019s statements at the 1986 re-\nsentencing, the California Supreme Court said this about\nJudge Metheny: \u201c[T]he record indicates that the trial court\nremained scrupulously fair and objective throughout the\nproceedings. It carefully weighed and considered both the\naggravating and mitigating evidence after they were\npresented.\u201d People v. Deere, 808 P.2d 1181, 1195 (Cal.\n1991) (in bank). The California Supreme Court affirmed\nevery one of Judge Metheny\u2019s rulings. Despite this, Deere\nnow seeks discovery and an evidentiary hearing on his claim\nthat his lawyer was ineffective in 1986 for failing to move to\ndisqualify Judge Metheny due to the judge\u2019s supposed\nsenility.\n\n    We hold today that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying Deere\u2019s request for discovery and a\nhearing on the issue. First, Deere came forward with no\nadmissible evidence that the judge was mentally impaired in\n1986. The most Deere offered were anecdotes recounted by\na grand total of three lawyers, anecdotes that are either\nhearsay, or that do not shed light on Judge Metheny\u2019s mental\nstatus in 1986, or that reveal no more than eccentricity as\ndistinguished from dementia. Tellingly, although Deere\u2019s\nhabeas counsel had access to a stable of mental health\nprofessionals, counsel furnished nothing \u2013 zero \u2013 from any\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                        7\n\nmental health professional opining that any of the stories\nabout Judge Metheny might be indicative of mental\nimpairment or even that they warrant further investigation.\nSecond, there is absolutely nothing to show that any of the\nsupposed incidents involving other lawyers were ever\ncommunicated to Deere\u2019s lawyer. Deere\u2019s lawyer can hardly\nbe faulted for failing to act upon gossip that was never passed\nalong to him. Third, the California Supreme Court reviewed\nJudge Metheny\u2019s handling of the 1986 proceeding, affirmed\nhim in toto, and found that he was scrupulously fair and\nobjective throughout the proceeding, and that he carefully\nweighed and considered the evidence. This appellate ruling\ndemonstrates two things: First, that Judge Metheny was not\nimpaired in 1986; and second, if the state supreme court had\nno cause to question Judge Metheny\u2019s mental status, neither\ndid Deere\u2019s counsel.\n\nI. Background\n\n   Cindy Gleason was Deere\u2019s former girlfriend and the\nmother of his baby daughter. Don Davis was married to\nCindy\u2019s sister Kathy. Kathy and Don had two daughters,\nMichelle and Melissa.\n\n    Cindy broke up with Deere around February 26, 1982.\nSome time on or after March 1, Deere took a .22 caliber\nsingle-action Ithaca rifle from the home of an acquaintance,\nMarc Nelson.\n\n    On March 2, 1982, Deere told Kathy that he was mad at\nDon for implying that Kathy was involved with Deere. Deere\nalso told Kathy that he was going to do something that would\ncause her to hate him. But Deere wouldn\u2019t be around for her\nto hate. Bruce Norton, a friend of Kathy\u2019s, was present\n\f8                     DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nduring the conversation. After Kathy left, Deere told Norton,\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna leave town, but I\u2019ve got something to do first.\u201d\nDeere added that he only thought he\u2019d get a couple of years\nin prison if he killed a couple of people. Norton testified that\nDeere did not appear to be intoxicated at the time.\n\n    Two days later, on March 4, 1982, Deere was seen around\ntown either drunk or in a daze. Deere telephoned Cindy\naround 3:20 p.m. and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be responsible\nfor what I do today.\u201d Deere then walked to the Davis trailer,\nbroke in and waited for Davis to return. Davis called Cindy\naround 4:00 p.m. to say that someone had been in his trailer.\nCindy asked Davis to call her back and let her know if\nanything was missing. Davis never called back. Later that\nevening Cindy and Kathy found the bodies of Davis and the\ntwo children in the Davis trailer. They had been shot with a\n.22 caliber rifle.\n\n    On March 9, 1982, five days after the murders, police\nfound Deere camping in the desert near Blythe, and arrested\nhim. Deere told the officers, \u201cI was going to call out to you\nbut I was afraid I would be shot.\u201d At Deere\u2019s campsite,\npolice found Nelson\u2019s .22 caliber rifle (later confirmed as the\nmurder weapon), .22 caliber bullets, a glass and some pictures\nof Cindy taken from the Davis trailer and letters written by\nDeere to his family. Davis\u2019s pickup truck was found in a\nditch adjacent to where Deere was found.\n\n    Riverside Police officers immediately requested that\nTommy Bolger, M.D., the consulting psychiatrist for\nRiverside County, interview Deere at the jail. Dr. Bolger had\nobtained a Doctor of Osteopathy degree in 1957. However,\nhe was allowed to use the \u201cM.D.\u201d designation pursuant to the\nCalifornia Reunification Act of 1962. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code\n\f                          DEERE V . CULLEN                                 9\n\n\u00a7 2396 (1962); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 2275 (2012). Dr.\nBolger had worked as a surgeon and medical doctor and\ntrained in psychiatry at Patton State Hospital from 1965\nthrough 1970. In 1975, he was hired as Chief Medical\nOfficer at San Quentin. In September of the same year, he\ntransferred to Soledad State Prison, where he served as a staff\npsychiatrist from 1977 through 1979. When he resigned from\nSoledad, Dr. Bolger moved to Blythe, opened a\nmedical/psychiatric practice and consulted as a psychiatrist\nfor Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Dr. Bolger died\nin 1987.1\n\n    On March 9, 1982, the day Deere was arrested, Dr. Bolger\ninterviewed Deere at the police station for a little over an\nhour. The next day, Dr. Bolger wrote that Deere was\ncooperative and competent. Deere had acknowledged that he\nwas aware that anything he told Dr. Bolger could be used\nagainst him in court.\n\n    Dr. Bolger obtained a complete history from Deere during\nthe interview. Deere told Dr. Bolger that he was being held\nfor three counts of murder. He said he had threatened to kill\n\n\n  1\n     In 1986, Bolger testified in this case that he was board-certified in\npsychiatry and internal medicine. In 1987, he testified in a different case\nthat he was not board-certified in any speciality. It is possible, of course,\nthat Bolger intentionally lied in 1986. It is also possible that there was a\ntranscription error or some other explanation for a statement that is so\neasily refuted. W hat is puzzling about this is the absence of any evidence\nin the record that Bolger, in a career that spanned 30 years, ever\nmisrepresented his credentials in a job application, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, or testimony\non any other occasion. In March, 2007, 20 years after Bolger died, the\nparties stipulated that Bolger was never board-certified, but the\nexplanation for his 1986 statement \u2013 a deliberate falsehood or something\nelse \u2013 remains a mystery.\n\f10                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nCindy, his common-law-wife, if she left him. Deere and\nCindy had a six-month-old child. Cindy had another daughter\nfrom a previous relationship. Deere stated that he knew Don,\nKathy, Michelle and Melissa \u201cwell\u201d because Deere, Cindy,\ntheir daughter and Cindy\u2019s other daughter had lived with the\nDavis family until Cindy left Deere. Kathy was divorcing\nDon. Deere claimed that he loved Melissa and Michelle. The\ngirls were \u201creal sweeties\u201d who had played with his children.\nDeere stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did this. I hope that if I am\nconvicted that I will get the gas chamber.\u201d\n\n    Deere also told Dr. Bolger he had been in special\neducation classes, did poorly in school and had a history of\nself-mutilation and alcohol and drug abuse. Deere stated that\nhe cut himself or broke things when he got \u201cenraged.\u201d\n\n    Dr. Bolger opined that Deere \u201canswers appropriately.\u201d\nHe is \u201coriented as to place, time and date,\u201d and is not\ndelusional. Dr. Bolger wrote that Deere is not mentally ill,\nbut has \u201ca severe personality problem.\u201d He \u201cdoes understand\nthe nature and the charges against him\u201d and \u201cwas certainly\ncapable of forming the intent and then carrying out the\naction.\u201d Finally, Dr. Bolger opined that Deere \u201cis capable of\ncooperating with counsel in his defense, if he feels it is to his\nadvantage.\u201d\n\n   Dr. Bolger diagnosed a \u201cDependent personality type, with\nexplosive features, Alcohol and drugs as factor\u201d and an\n\u201cAntisocial personality type, with borderline features, not\npsychotic.\u201d\n\n   On the same day Dr. Bolger provided his report to police,\nGlenn S. Jones was appointed to defend Deere. Mr. Jones, a\nRiverside County Public Defender, had been admitted to the\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                       11\n\nbar in 1972. Before representing Deere, Mr. Jones had\npracticed for 10 years as a criminal defense trial attorney,\nwith eight years as an assistant public defender. Mr. Jones\nhad represented defendants in \u201ca couple of dozen\u201d murder\ncases, with one prior death penalty case.\n\n    Deere initially pled not guilty. Mr. Jones testified in 1998\nthat he had repeatedly discussed the case with Deere \u201cdozens\nof times\u201d for hours at a time. From 1982 through 1986,\nDeere consistently told Mr. Jones that he intended to plead\nguilty, waive a jury trial and request the death penalty. Mr.\nJones said that Deere consistently gave three reasons for\nwanting to plead guilty, even if it meant the death penalty.\nFirst, Deere was \u201cconcerned about his family and friends, his\nrelationships.\u201d Deere \u201cdid not want anything done what\nwould in any way bring sadness or pain to\u201d his family. He\n\u201chad done enough, and he wasn\u2019t going to do anymore.\u201d\nSecond, he wanted to show that he had dignity and morality.\nThird, Deere wanted to take responsibility for his actions\nbecause he had committed the crimes and believed in capital\npunishment.\n\n    Mr. Jones would later testify that at the outset of the\nrepresentation he would not consent to Deere pleading guilty.\nBut \u201cover time,\u201d Mr. Jones concluded that, although Deere\nwas not well-educated, he was \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and \u201cvery\narticulate.\u201d As a result of their numerous conversations, Mr.\nJones had \u201cabsolutely no doubt that Deere was competent.\u201d\nMr. Jones stated:\n\n       [Deere\u2019s] discussions with me were always\n       vivid and intelligent, no indication that he did\n       not know what we were doing, with the\n       consequences of what we were doing. He\n\f12                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n       knew exactly what he was charged with and\n       what the proceedings were all about. There\n       were just no hallmarks of incompetency there\n       at all.\n\nMr. Jones also testified in 1998 that there \u201cwas never a\nquestion in [his] mind\u201d that Deere was able to assist with his\ndefense:\n\n       He had the ability. It was a very reasoned\n       decision he made as to what he wanted to do,\n       which was the reason why he acted the way\n       he did or said what he said or did what he did.\n       Not because he was acting under any delusion\n       or hallucination or fantasy or any kind of\n       psychiatric or psychological, you know,\n       reason for his behavior.\n\nMr. Jones added that Deere cooperated with his defense by\nlistening to and discussing Mr. Jones\u2019s suggestions, signing\nreleases, never refusing to talk to Mr. Jones, and not\ninterrupting discussions or walking out.\n\n    Mr. Jones also stated that he \u201cfound no indication that\n[Deere\u2019s] desire to plead guilty and obtain the death penalty\nhad anything to do with a death wish or that there was any\nsuicidal impulse behind [Deere\u2019s] desire to plead guilty.\u201d\nRather, Deere pled guilty \u201cout of a strong sense of justice he\nhad that he deserved the death penalty; it was a moral\nstatement of principle that I accepted.\u201d \u201cIt was clear\u201d to Mr.\nJones that Deere \u201cunderstood every aspect of the\nproceeding.\u201d Mr. Jones added, \u201cI have dealt with hundreds,\nthousands of defendants, and [Deere] did not in any way,\nshape, or form impress me as being incompetent.\u201d\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      13\n\n    Deere eventually persuaded Mr. Jones that he wanted to\nplead guilty, was competent to plead guilty and was prepared\nto take responsibility for his actions.\n\n    Mr. Jones testified in 1998 that he wanted to pursue\ninsanity and diminished capacity mental health defenses in\n1982. He obtained funding for mental health experts,\nintended to hire at least one psychologist and psychiatrist and\nhe hired a psychologist, William Jones, Ph.D. (no relation to\nMr. Jones), to evaluate Deere for mental health defenses. Mr.\nJones requested Dr. Jones to perform a general mental\nexamination of Deere, but not to assess him for competency.\nHis reason for this was two-fold: first, he did not doubt\nDeere\u2019s competency; and second, it was his practice to use\nseparate experts for competency questions and mental health\ndefenses.\n\n    Mr. Jones and Deere had several discussions about\npossible mental health defenses. But, Deere consistently\nrefused to \u201cdo anything inconsistent with his ultimate\nchoice,\u201d to accept responsibility for what he had done. Deere\nconvinced Mr. Jones that \u201che would have no part in any kind\nof mental defense.\u201d\n\n    On June 18, 1982, Deere moved to change his pleas to\nguilty. Judge Fred Metheny presided over Deere\u2019s case.\nBecause the Information did not specify the degrees of\nmurder, the parties agreed that the judge would decide the\ndegrees of murder and special circumstances if the guilty plea\nwere accepted. Judge Metheny advised Deere that he could\nbe facing the death penalty if he pled guilty. Deere assured\nthe judge that he had discussed his case with Mr. Jones. The\nprosecutor then suggested that before the court entertain a\nchange of plea, it should appoint a psychiatrist to examine\n\f14                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nDeere for competence just to make sure that the plea was\n\u201cproper and just.\u201d The prosecutor recommended Dr. Bolger,\nwho had \u201cpreviously examined\u201d Deere. Mr. Jones agreed to\nDr. Bolger\u2019s appointment. Judge Metheny then appointed Dr.\nBolger to examine Deere.\n\n    Dr. Bolger interviewed and tested Deere for an additional\nhour and a half and provided his second written report dated\nJune 21, 1982. Dr. Bolger found Deere \u201cextremely\ncooperative and alert.\u201d Deere\u2019s mood was \u201cstable . . . neither\nbeing depressed nor unduly elated.\u201d Deere denied delusions\nand hallucinations. Dr. Bolger found \u201cno evidence of\norganicity.\u201d Dr. Bolger also opined that Deere showed no\nevidence of psychosis or abnormal thinking and was not\nmentally ill.\n\n    Dr. Bolger further opined that Deere was \u201cable to carry\nhis ideas to goal.\u201d He was \u201cwell aware of the charges\u201d and\n\u201cimplications of pleading guilty.\u201d Deere had been \u201cwell\nadvised\u201d and was \u201caware of and able to understand the\nmeaning of the waiver of the rights to a jury trial.\u201d He was\n\u201cable to adequately assist his attorney in the preparation and\nthe presentation of his case.\u201d Finally, Deere was aware of a\nprobability of a death sentence. But, he also knew that a\ncourt would decide the sentence. Deere was motivated to\nhaving \u201cas short a trial as possible . . . since he indicate[d]\nthat either pleading guilty or not guilty would in all\nprobability result in the same decision.\u201d\n\n   At the same time Dr. Bolger was examining Deere, Mr.\nJones was pursuing a separate mental health defense\nexamination by Dr. Jones because, even if a guilty plea were\naccepted, there would still be a trial to determine the degree\nof murder. Mr. Jones testified in 1998 that, after hours of\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      15\n\ndiscussion with Deere, Deere agreed to meet with Dr. Jones.\nOn June 23, 1982, Dr. Jones examined and tested Deere for\none and a half hours.\n\n    Two days later, on June 25, 1982, Deere advised the court\nthat he intended to plead guilty to the three counts of murder.\nJudge Metheny found that Deere\u2019s appearance, actions,\ncomments and conduct in court had established that Deere\nunderstood the charges and was \u201cready, willing and able to\ncooperate\u201d with defense counsel. Dr. Bolger\u2019s report, Judge\nMetheny stated, had confirmed the judge\u2019s observations that\nDeere was competent. Mr. Jones agreed that Deere was\ncompetent, stating:\n\n       I have seen no evidence in Mr. Deere that\n       would suggest that he\u2019s in any way\n       incompetent. I\u2019ve reviewed with him the\n       report of Dr. Bolger, and I\u2019d be willing to\n       stipulate at this time the Court may accept the\n       report and base its rulings on the report.\n\nThe prosecutor \u201cconcur[ed] with Mr. Jones\u2019 evaluation of Mr.\nDeere\u2019s mental state\u201d and also stipulated that the court could\nconsider Dr. Bolger\u2019s report that Deere was aware of the\ncharges, understood his waiver and was competent.\n\n    The change of plea transcript establishes that Deere was\nlucid, clearly understood the proceedings and consulted with\ncounsel when he wanted to. Judge Metheny extensively\nquestioned Deere about the rights Deere was waiving, and\nDeere responded appropriately. When asked to explain his\nunderstanding of the right to a jury trial, Deere said, \u201ctwelve\npeople, you know, find out if you\u2019re guilty or not, on the\nevidence they have.\u201d When asked what the charges were,\n\f16                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nDeere responded, \u201c[t]hree counts of murder.\u201d Judge Metheny\nthen asked Deere, \u201cwhat is your understanding of the nature\nof that charge?\u201d Deere conferred with Mr. Jones and\nresponded, \u201c[i]ntentional killings with malice.\u201d In response\nto Judge Metheny\u2019s question of what Deere had done to be\ncharged with murder, Deere stated:\n\n       On March 4th, 1982, at about 4:00 p.m. I shot,\n       with intent to kill and did kill Don Davis,\n       Melissa, \u2013 I mean Michelle Davis, Melissa\n       Davis. I used a .22 caliber rifle, and the\n       shootings took place at the Davis\u2019 home near\n       Blythe, Riverside County, California. At the\n       time of the shootings, none of the three\n       victims did anything to provoke me in any\n       way.\n\nWhen asked what sentence he was facing, Deere responded,\n\u201cdeath or life in prison.\u201d In response to the question\nregarding what sentence he faced for using the rifle, Deere\nconferred with counsel and responded, \u201canything less than\nlife, you know, would add two years to any other sentence.\u201d\nFinally, Judge Metheny asked Deere, \u201cwho do you believe\nwill decide what your sentence will be?\u201d Deere responded,\n\u201c[t]he judge or the jury.\u201d\n\n    When the judge asked Mr. Jones about the possibility of\nan insanity defense or mental states defense, Mr. Jones\nresponded:\n\n       Your honor, I have spent a great deal of effort\n       and time investigating the possibility of\n       insanity defense or some other mentally\n       related defense. It is my firm conclusion that\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      17\n\n       there is no such defense; and even if there\n       were, Mr. Deere has advised me that he, under\n       no circumstances, will enter a plea of guilty\n       by reason of insanity.\n\n           I find no evidence to support any defense\n       that would reduce these charges to\n       manslaughter.\n\n    Mr. Jones then concurred in the plea and reaffirmed his\nbelief that Deere was competent to enter the plea:\n\n       As to this particular case, Mr. Deere and I\n       have spent literally hours discussing the case,\n       debating the case, literally arguing about what\n       is appropriate. I think it\u2019s rather obvious that\n       a man\u2019s pleading guilty in a capital case is\n       rare. And when I began this case, I didn\u2019t\n       even consider \u2013 it didn\u2019t even enter my mind\n       that I would consent to such a plea. And Mr.\n       Deere has slowly but surely persuaded me that\n       this is what he wishes to do, that he\u2019s\n       competent to do it, and he\u2019s prepared to take\n       the full responsibility for his actions. And I\n       can find absolutely no basis, in my\n       experience, training or the investigation of\n       this case, which would suggest he should not\n       be permitted to do exactly what he wants to\n       do, knowing the consequences of his act.\n\nMr. Jones advised the court that Deere had given Mr. Jones\nthree reasons for pleading guilty. First, Deere wanted to take\nresponsibility for his actions and \u201cmaintain[] a small amount\nof dignity as a human being.\u201d Mr. Jones explained, \u201c[h]e\n\f18                       DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nknows that doesn\u2019t change what happened. He knows it\ndoesn\u2019t change the agony and the hurt that he\u2019s caused the\nsurvivors, but it\u2019s the one thing he can do to show that he can\ntake responsibility.\u201d Second, Deere wanted to protect his\nfamily and the victims\u2019 family from a \u201chighly publicized\u201d\ntrial and \u201cmore agony.\u201d Third, Deere knew he would be\nfound guilty, favored capital punishment and was willing to\nface justice. Mr. Jones explained:\n\n         Mr. Deere and I have debated the theory of\n         capital punishment quite a bit. He is in favor\n         of capital punishment, and I am not. He\n         thinks that this case is an appropriate case for\n         capital punishment, and he simply feels that\n         justice should be done in this case, and he\n         feels that pleading guilty and taking what\n         results has justice; whatever happens, happens\n         . . . He knows the result of a jury trial. He\n         knows what would happen if the case went to\n         jury trial, and he feels that the expense of a\n         circus or charade of a trial is not right for him\n         or for the community.\n\n    Deere then pled guilty to three open counts of murder2\nand admitted to using the gun. Judge Metheny found that the\nguilty pleas were knowing, voluntary and supported by a\nfactual basis.\n\n   Five days after the change of plea hearing, Deere again\nmet with Dr. Jones for the continuation of the examination\nMr. Jones requested in aid of proceedings yet to come to\n\n 2\n   The degrees of murder were left for the judge to decide in a subsequent\nproceeding.\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      19\n\ndetermine the degree of murder and the penalty. Dr. Jones\nmet with and tested Deere for about the same length of time\nthat Dr. Bolger had met with and tested Deere. Dr. Jones\u2019s\n1982 findings, conclusions and diagnoses were amazingly\nsimilar to Dr. Bolger\u2019s. Dr. Jones opined in 1982 that \u201cDeere\nwas oriented as to time, place, and person\u201d and \u201caware of the\ncharges against him.\u201d He was \u201cgenerally cooperative.\u201d\nDeere had \u201cno obvious thought disorders in his\ncommunication.\u201d His memory was \u201cgenerally adequate.\u201d He\ndenied hallucinations and delusions. Deere\u2019s tests were\n\u201cwithin normal limits\u201d and did not indicate visual motor or\nneurological dysfunction. Dr. Jones also opined that Deere\ncut himself to discharge anger, get attention and sympathy\nand to manipulate others. Dr. Jones concluded that the self-\nmutilation was \u201ca very powerful attention-getting device.\u201d\n\n    Deere told Dr. Jones that he cooperated because defense\ncounsel \u201ctold him that lack of cooperation in a psychological\nevaluation might jeopardize his conviction.\u201d Deere \u201cwished\nto be found guilty and to accept whatever punishment the\ncourt would impose.\u201d Deere also told Dr. Jones that he was\n\u201cwilling to accept\u201d the death penalty and \u201cindeed would\nprefer it to life imprisonment.\u201d Deere stated that a death\nsentence would make him feel better, \u201chelp the people he has\nhurt,\u201d protect others from participating in trial, protect his\nfamily and keep the matter out of the newspapers. Pleading\nguilty, Dr. Jones opined, was \u201ca further extension of\n[Deere\u2019s] very strong masochistic tendencies.\u201d\n\n   Dr. Jones diagnosed Deere with adjustment disorder with\ndepressed mood; mixed substance abuse disorder, including\nabuse of alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, amphetamines; and\nborderline personality disorder with anti-social aspects. In\nother words, Dr. Jones and Dr. Bolger basically came to the\n\f20                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nsame conclusions. Mr. Jones would later testify that none of\nthe reports, including the reports from Dr. Bolger, Dr. Jones\nand the two private investigators that Mr. Jones hired, gave\nMr. Jones any information that would have caused him to\nquestion Deere\u2019s competence.\n\n    On July 23, 1982, the parties returned to court for Judge\nMetheny to determine the degrees of the three murders. Mr.\nJones testified in 1998 that he and Deere had vigorously\ndiscussed the issue. Mr. Jones wanted to go for a second\ndegree murder finding. Like all their conversations, it was\n\u201cgive and take:\u201d\n\n       He always knew what he wanted, and he was\n       going to get what he wanted to get. And we\n       dealt with each other very civilly on all the\n       vigorous points, so it wasn\u2019t simply him being\n       absolutely uncooperative with me at some\n       point or not. There were always discussions,\n       and eventually when we would do something\n       his way, it was because: \u201cOkay, Ronnie,\n       we\u2019ve discussed this, and its obviously what\n       you want to do, and I can\u2019t see a reason at this\n       point in doing something different.\u201d\n\nMr. Jones testified that, even though Deere didn\u2019t like his\nposition regarding second degree murder, Deere agreed to let\nMr. Jones argue that the crimes were second, not first, degree\nmurder.\n\n    The parties stipulated that Judge Metheny could consider\nthe preliminary hearing testimony to determine the degrees of\nmurder. Again, Deere was alert and engaged. At the\nprosecutor\u2019s request, Judge Metheny again advised Deere that\n\f                        DEERE V . CULLEN                            21\n\na first degree murder finding would require a penalty phase\nand could result in a death sentence. Deere responded\nappropriately to the judge\u2019s questions and waived his rights.\n\n     When Judge Metheny expressed concern that the\npreliminary hearing testimony might not establish Deere\u2019s\nstate of mind at the time of the crimes, Mr. Jones responded\nthat Deere had given specific instructions not to offer\nevidence regarding the degrees of murder and asked to\ncontinue the discussion in chambers. In chambers, Judge\nMetheny unsuccessfully tried to convince Deere to allow\nmental health expert testimony. Judge Metheny explained to\nDeere that state of mind evidence would help establish first\nor second degree murder. He suggested that Deere allow Dr.\nBolger to testify. Deere responded that he didn\u2019t \u201cagree upon\nall the doctors.\u201d The judge advised Deere that he would not\nhave to testify, but asked Deere to agree to let the doctors\ntestify.\n\n    However, at the next hearing, Mr. Jones advised the court\nthat he would not be offering Dr. Bolger\u2019s testimony because\nDeere objected to having private family matters discussed in\ncourt. Deere confirmed that he agreed with defense counsel.3\n\n\n 3\n       MR JONES: Your Honor, at this time we will not offer\n       any evidence on the issue of degree. I\u2019ve discussed the\n       matter with Mr. Deere, and it is his specific instructions\n       that we not call Dr. Bolger. His reasons are personal.\n       He knows that Dr. Bolger would be revealing\n       conversations he\u2019s had with him, which he feels are\n       private. And Dr. Bolger will be discussing family\n       matters, Ronnie\u2019s childhood and his brothers and sisters\n       and that sort of thing, and he\u2019s instructed me we are not\n       to call Dr. Bolger as a witness; and so at this time we\n       would not offer any evidence.\n\f22                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nThe prosecutor declined to present additional evidence and\nreaffirmed that he believed that Deere was competent,\nmaking rational decisions and acting appropriately. Judge\nMetheny agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s assessment, and again\nfound that Deere was competent and rational.\n\n    The prosecutor argued for first degree murder because the\nevidence showed that Deere planned the murder for days and\nthen carried out his plan. Deere shot the girls, he argued,\nbecause they were witnesses. Mr. Jones argued for second\ndegree murder, citing evidence that Deere was suffering\nemotional turmoil and intoxicated. In addition, Mr. Jones\nargued that the children did not live at the trailer, and there\nwas no way Deere could know the girls would be with their\nfather that afternoon. Thus, premeditation as to them was\nlacking.\n\n    Judge Metheny then found that the killing of the two\nchildren was second degree murder, but that the killing of\nDon Davis was first degree murder. In a nuanced ruling, the\njudge reasoned that Deere clearly planned and intended to kill\nthe father, but had not anticipated that the children would be\npresent. Because the evidence regarding the children could\nbe reasonably interpreted as either first or second degree\nmurder, Judge Metheny found Deere guilty of the second\ndegree murder of the children.\n\n    Judge Metheny also found that the multiple murder\nallegation was true: Deere committed multiple first and\n\n\n       THE COURT: I take it that\u2019s what you want to do, Mr.\n       Deere; is that right?\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      23\n\nsecond degree murders. This finding made Deere eligible for\nthe death penalty.\n\n    At the penalty phase hearing, Deere attempted to waive\nhis right to a jury trial. But the prosecutor refused to waive\nthe state\u2019s right. Deere indicated his intention to absent\nhimself. Mr. Jones explained to the court:\n\n       You know, he wants a death verdict. He said\n       that over and over again. And any procedure\n       that may impede that he just doesn\u2019t want to\n       have any part of, and he sees a jury trial on the\n       penalty phase as possibly resulting in a verdict\n       other than a death penalty. So that\u2019s his line\n       of thinking. It\u2019s very rational, and I don\u2019t see\n       any possible basis for concluding that he\u2019s not\n       competent. His lack of cooperation doesn\u2019t\n       stem from any mental disability. It stems\n       from his very logical decision about what he\n       wants as a result.\n\nUltimately, the parties agreed to waive a penalty jury. The\njudge again found Deere competent:\n\n       I think you\u2019re competent to make that\n       decision. I\u2019ve listened to that decision for a\n       number of times now, and I haven\u2019t the\n       slightest doubt that you have the ability and\n       the right to make that decision.\n\n   At the continued penalty hearing, Deere reaffirmed that\nhe wanted to waive his right to a jury trial at the penalty\nphase and understood the rights he was waiving. After Mr.\n\f24                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nJones and the prosecutor concurred in the waiver, Judge\nMetheny found Deere\u2019s waiver to be knowing and voluntary.\n\n    At Deere\u2019s request, Mr. Jones did not present mitigation\nevidence. Instead, the parties stipulated that Judge Metheny\ncould consider the evidence already admitted at the degree of\nmurder hearing. Judge Metheny made sure that Deere\nconcurred and understood that he was waiving his right to\nconfront witnesses and found Deere\u2019s waiver to be knowing\nand voluntary.\n\n     Deere expressed remorse for the crimes and said that he\ndeserved to die. Mr. Jones then commented that Deere\u2019s\nactions were \u201cunprecedented.\u201d               But, Deere had\ncommunicated his feelings \u201csteadfastly since practically the\nfirst day.\u201d Deere had \u201cslowly but surely swayed\u201d Mr. Jones\nto permit him to plead guilty, admit the special\ncircumstances, waive jury trials for the guilt and penalty\nphases and decline to present mitigating evidence. Mr. Jones\nand Deere had \u201cargued quite vociferously about what to do in\nthis case.\u201d But Deere stated that he didn\u2019t want to cheapen\nhis relationships. He did not deserve mercy and would lose\nhis \u201clast vestige of dignity\u201d if he begged for mercy. The only\nthing Deere could do to show the victims\u2019 family that he was\nsorry was to accept full responsibility for his actions.\n\n    Mr. Jones advised the court that each decision was made\n\u201cin close consultation with\u201d Deere, who knew \u201cthe\nconsequences of every decision he\u2019s made, as well as the\nconsequences of his criminal acts.\u201d Mr. Jones added that\nDeere\u2019s \u201cdecisions are not suicidal, crazy decisions. They are\nrational, intelligent decisions by a man who realizes what he\nhas done and says, \u2018This is the only position I can take to\nshow you that I am still a man and not an animal.\u2019\u201d\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      25\n\n     Judge Metheny then sentenced Deere to 15 years to life\nfor the murder of each of the children and to death for the\nfirst degree murder of their father.\n\n    On December 31, 1985, the California Supreme Court\naffirmed the convictions and special circumstance finding,\nbut reversed the death sentence. People v. Deere, 710 P.2d\n925, 926 (Cal. 1985).\n\n     Different counsel appointed for Deere by the state\nsupreme court for the automatic direct appeal argued that the\ntrial court should have conducted a sua sponte competency\nhearing because preliminary hearing testimony showed that\n\u201cshortly before the murders\u201d Deere asked Kathy Davis to kill\nhim, had exhibited suicidal tendencies and had cut himself\nwith a razor blade in the past and \u201cwas frequently\nintoxicated.\u201d Deere claimed that his guilty plea and waiver\nof a jury trial amounted to a suicide attempt. Id. at 927. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court rejected the claim, holding that the\nrecord did not show \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of mental\nincompetence. Id. at 928. Rather, the trial court and defense\ncounsel believed Deere to be competent. The trial court had\nappointed the mental health expert, Dr. Bolger, \u201c\u2018to be\ncertain\u2019 of defendant\u2019s ability to stand trial and cooperate\nwith counsel,\u201d even though there was no evidence of\nincompetence before the court. Id. at 927\u201328. The mental\nhealth expert found Deere mentally competent to plead guilty.\nThe expert opined that Deere \u201cdisplayed no evidence of\npsychosis, abnormal thinking or mental illness\u201d and was\naware of the charges and the consequences of waiving a jury\ntrial. Id. at 927.\n\n   The California Supreme Court also held that neither the\ndecision to plead guilty nor the waiver of a jury trial\n\f26                     DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nestablished incompetence, reasoning that Deere gave rational\nreasons for pleading guilty and avoiding a jury trial. Id. at\n927\u201328. He \u201cfelt great remorse for his offenses and was\nprepared to suffer the consequences of a judgment of death.\u201d\nId. at 927. He also didn\u2019t want a long drawn-out jury trial.\nHe didn\u2019t want \u201cto waste his time listening to trial counsel\n\u2018yak\u2019 about which prospective jurors were opposed to the\ndeath penalty and which were not.\u201d Id. at 928.\n\n    Although the California Supreme Court affirmed the\nconvictions and life sentences, it reversed the death sentence,\nholding that counsel\u2019s honest, but mistaken, belief that he\nshould not present mitigating evidence because of his client\u2019s\nwish to present no evidence nevertheless denied Deere\neffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 931\u201334. The case was\nremanded for a new penalty phase trial.\n\n   In 1986, Judge Metheny convened the penalty phase trial.\nAgain, Deere was lucid and understood the proceedings.\nDeere consistently reaffirmed his jury trial waiver and\nopposition to mitigating evidence.4\n\n 4\n       T H E CO U RT : I assum e, M r.

I read it all.\n\nTHE COURT: I don\u2019t really believe we\u2019re ready to go\nto trial today; do you, gentlemen?\n\nMR. JONES: No, that\u2019s correct, Your Honor. . . I\u2019ve\ndiscussed with Mr. Deere his desires, in terms of\nwhether he wants a jury trial or a court trial. He clearly\nadvised me he does not want a jury trial. His previous\nwaiver of jury is still his desire.\n\nTHE COURT: Of course, you understand you have the\nright to have a jury trial, if you wish to have it.\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n\n***\n\nTHE COURT: . . [The trial] will be limited to the\nmitigating and aggravating circumstances. You know\nwhat that means. I\u2019m sure of that.\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: And you have a right \u2013 and your\nattorney, Mr. Jones, will get this set up \u2013 you will have\na right to put on the individuals who will testify for you\nas to mitigating circumstances. I will be the judge and\nthe finder of fact on this particular question and issue as\nto whether the mitigating circumstances outweigh the\naggravating circumstances.\n\n    That puts us in a position where the court has the\nresponsibility to determine whether or not the sentence\nwould be life imprisonment or whether it would be the\ndeath penalty, or there\u2019s a possibility that there could be\nsome other conclusion.\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n\f28                  DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n\n\nJudge Metheny found Deere competent and the waiver\nknowing:\n\n           THE COURT: Very well. . . . The court\n       does find at this time that Mr. Deere \u2013 as he\n       did the last time \u2013 completely understands\n       what we\u2019ve discussed. I\u2019ve never had any\n       doubt about his intelligence and ability to\n       understand. I think he\u2019s made his decision\n       fairly based on the facts we\u2019ve discussed this\n       morning.\n\nAt the continued hearing, Mr. Jones added:\n\n       I have discussed in detail with Mr. Deere his\n       desires and he\u2019s made them very clear to me.\n       He does not change his position in any matter.\n       He previously waived jury trial and continues\n       to waive jury trial. He wants nothing to do\n       with the jury trial. And I believe he\u2019s\n       satisfied with the way I\u2019ve handled the case.\n       He\u2019s certainly indicated nothing to me that\n       he\u2019s dissatisfied in any way, shape, or form\n       with my performance.\n\n\n\n       THE COURT: Do you understand that?\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n\n       THE COURT: Do you have any questions?\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: No.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                       29\n\nJudge Metheny then directly addressed Deere to make sure\nthat Deere understood and continued to waive his right to a\njury trial:\n\n           THE COURT: You know originally we\n       went through this before in great detail that\n       you had a right to the jury and you had a right\n       to have the jury decide if you were found\n       guilty of first degree murder. Then the jury\n       would decide according to the aggravating\n       and mitigating circumstances. You did waive\n       that. The last time you were in here, just a\n       few weeks ago I asked you again. I don\u2019t\n       mean to be facetious about this. I just want to\n       have this done fairly. And I can assure you,\n       and I want the record to reflect this, that I\n       haven\u2019t made up my mind yet at all.\n\n           I\u2019m going to have to listen to the evidence.\n       I can assure you I\u2019m going to be fair. If I felt\n       otherwise, I would not go any further with this\n       case.\n\n          I\u2019m asking you right now, Mr. Deere, if\n       you want us to pick a jury and go back to the\n       aggravating and mitigating circumstances?\n\n          THE DEFENDANT: No. I\u2019m satisfied the\n       way it is right now. I don\u2019t want a jury.\n\n    The prosecution offered only the aggravation evidence\npresented in the first trial. Despite the fact that the case had\nbeen remanded due to ineffective assistance of counsel for\nMr. Jones\u2019s failure to set forth mitigating evidence, Mr. Jones\n\f30                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nagain refused to put on any mitigation. Mr. Jones said, \u201c[a]s\nI indicated during the first trial from day one Ronnie Deere\nhas told me exactly how he wants this case to be handled.\nHe\u2019s never changed once.\u201d Mr. Jones also re-affirmed that\nDeere was competent and rational:\n\n       He has convinced me that he knows what he\u2019s\n       doing. He\u2019s not crazy. He\u2019s not incompetent.\n       He\u2019s not insane. He knows exactly what he\u2019s\n       doing. He knows what he did to be convicted\n       of these crimes and he knows \u2013 or he believes\n       in his heart that justice should be done.\n\nMr. Jones repeated that Deere did not want a trial or\nevidence:\n\n       He does not want any evidence presented on\n       his behalf because in his heart that is his\n       private life and to bring that evidence into\n       court would violate his relationships with\n       everybody he holds dear and respects in the\n       world. And to him, those relationships are\n       more important than anything else, including\n       his life.\n\n    Although the judge threatened Mr. Jones with contempt\nif he didn\u2019t present mitigation, Mr. Jones reaffirmed that\ncontempt would not change his mind. Mr. Jones again\nexplained that Deere had \u201cslowly but surely convinced\u201d him\nnot to present evidence. He believed Deere had \u201cmade his\ndecisions consciously, temperately, and not in the heat of\npassion, but based on his true and sincere and honest beliefs\nabout what is right for him.\u201d After Mr. Jones again refused\nto admit mitigating evidence, Judge Metheny found the\n\f                         DEERE V . CULLEN                             31\n\nRiverside Public Defender\u2019s Office and Mr. Jones in\ncontempt and reinstated the death penalty.\n\n    Less than a month later, Judge Metheny stayed that order\nand appointed an attorney, Jonathan Landau, as a friend of the\ncourt, and an investigator, Richard Welby, to investigate and\npresent mitigating evidence to the court. In addition, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court struck the \u201cstayed\u201d death sentence\nas \u201chaving been entered through inadvertence.\u201d5 After the\nstate supreme court vacated the death penalty order, Judge\nMetheny vacated the contempt order.\n\n     At the continued hearing, now with Mr. Landau present\nas an amicus, Deere reaffirmed his jury waiver. Mr. Landau\ndiscussed the mitigation evidence from the preliminary\nhearing transcripts, and then presented six mitigation\nwitnesses, including Dr. Bolger. Dr. Bolger opined that\nDeere suffered from diminished capacity at the time of the\nmurders because he was under the influence of alcohol or\ndrugs, stressed and traumatized. Dr. Bolger testified that,\nalthough Deere had a hard time expressing his remorse, he\nwas \u201cextremely remorseful over the death of the two\nchildren\u201d and \u201cthe influence that this whole thing would have\nupon his daughter.\u201d Dr. Bolger also believed that Deere\n\n\n\n  5\n    A \u201cCommitment Judgment of Death\u201d was filed by the Clerk of Court\non April 22, 1986. On May 14, 1986, Judge Metheny stayed the sentence\nto obtain mitigating evidence and scheduled a penalty hearing for June 27,\n1986. In a May 19, 1986 minute order, Judge Metheny appointed Richard\nW elby, a licensed private investigator, to investigate for mitigating\nevidence. Citing the May 19 order, the California Supreme Court\nsubsequently concluded that the April 22 judgment was \u201cthrough\ninadvertence, prematurely filed.\u201d It ordered the judgment stricken and\nreturned the case to the trial court.\n\f32                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\ncould be of benefit to himself and society if spared the death\npenalty and imprisoned for life instead.\n\n    Investigator Welby testified about his investigation,\nadding that he had found that Deere cared about his mother\nand father and never forgot a birthday or holiday. A neighbor\ntestified that Deere had helped her with yard work. Deere\u2019s\nsister testified that Deere was upset at the time of the murders\nbecause of his deteriorating relationship with Cindy. Deere\nloved his daughter, had been a protective brother and had\nnever been violent. Deere\u2019s mother testified that she loved\nher son and wanted him to live. Finally, Mr. Landau\nintroduced a piece of Deere\u2019s art to show the work he could\naccomplish in prison.\n\n    After Mr. Landau argued that life in prison would be\nmore punishment than a death sentence, Deere asked to\nrespond. This is what he said:\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019d like to make a\n       statement due to his saying about my being in\n       prison for life.      That that would be\n       punishment, you know.\n\n       THE COURT: A punishment to you?\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: I understand what he\u2019s\n       saying. I don\u2019t think he really knows much\n       about prison life. He\u2019s going by hearsay. I\u2019m\n       going to state something that I\u2019m pretty sure\n       that if they want to check it out they can check\n       it out with the guards.\n\f              DEERE V . CULLEN                       33\n\n    Being in prison for all your life for the rest\nof your life \u2013 don\u2019t think I do without the\nluxuries on the streets. I drink every Friday\nnight, every Saturday night. I smoke my\nweed everyday. You tell me how being in\nprison the rest of my life is really a\npunishment. I see my old lady every week. If\nI get married then I get contact visits. So he\ndoesn\u2019t really know what punishment is. I go\nto the yard seven days a week. I sit there if I\ngot a hangover, then I\u2019ll go out.\n\n    How can he say \u2013 he\u2019s never been there.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\nHow does that benefit society? I committed a\ncrime punishable by death. I\u2019m not looking at\nas an eye for an eye. I didn\u2019t write the law.\nThe law stated I committed a crime\npunishable by death. Not sitting there for the\nrest of my life which costs taxpayers a lot of\nmoney.\n\n     I\u2019m sitting in there doing what I did out\nhere. I smoke weed everyday. You can ask\nany guards there. They will verify that.\nWhatever is out there is in here. I make\nmoney off my artwork. I make thousands of\ndollars off my artwork. It doesn\u2019t hurt me a\nbit to pay the money for drugs or drinking. I\nlive comfortable.\n\n    If they think that\u2019s punishment, then you\ngo ahead and make your decision from that. I\ncan live a life like that. The rest of my life.\n\f34                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n   When Judge Metheny responded that he had to \u201cmake a\ndecision based upon the evidence,\u201d Deere added:\n\n       I believe in justice. I believe Kathy has a\n       right to justice. I don\u2019t look at this as an eye\n       for an eye. I don\u2019t think two wrongs make a\n       right. I look at it as the law stated. I\n       committed a crime punishable by death. I\n       should have been punished a long time ago by\n       that law.\n\n   Mr. Jones then argued for a life sentence because of the\nabsence of aggravating circumstances and the stress Deere\nwas under at the time of the offenses. Judge Metheny\nweighed all of the mitigating and aggravating evidence and\nagain sentenced Deere to death.\n\n     On May 2, 1991, the California Supreme Court affirmed\nthe convictions and death sentence. Deere, 808 P.2d at 1195.\nDifferent appellate counsel, again appointed by the state\nsupreme court for the automatic direct appeal, argued that\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to investigate competence\nin light of the fact that Deere was despondent, had cut himself\nand was suicidal. Id. at 1186. The California Supreme Court\nrejected the ineffective assistance claim, reaffirming its prior\nholding that Deere\u2019s history of cutting of himself with razor\nblades when his girlfriend threatened to leave and asking\nKathy Davis to kill him two days before the murders did not\nestablish that he was incompetent to plead guilty or stand\ntrial. Id. The court said:\n\n       [N]othing at the penalty retrial suggested\n       that the state of defendant\u2019s mental\n       competence had changed for the worse.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      35\n\n       Indeed, the trial court inquired of defendant\n       directly on several occasions whether he\n       wished to waive his right to a jury trial. In\n       each instance, defendant responded clearly\n       and unequivocally that he did. The trial court\n       also observed for the record that defendant\n       appeared to be rational and intelligent.\n\nId.\n\n    The California Supreme Court also affirmed the death\nsentence, holding that Judge Metheny \u201cproceeded with a\ncareful and detailed analysis of the evidence relevant to the\npenalty determination, with specific reference to the statutory\nmitigating and aggravating factors.\u201d Id. at 1190. After listing\nall of the evidence considered by Judge Metheny, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that \u201cthe record leaves no\ndoubt that the court\u2019s sentencing decision was guided by clear\nand proper standards.\u201d Id.\n\n    Deere filed his first petition for writ of habeas corpus in\nfederal court on May 18, 1993, and amended the petition on\nJuly 11, 1994, claiming, among other things, that he was\nincompetent to plead guilty and that Mr. Jones rendered\nineffective assistance of counsel in failing to establish his\nincompetence. In support of these allegations, Deere\u2019s\nhabeas counsel furnished a new report from Dr. Jones and the\nreport of Frank Rosenthal, Ph.D., M.D., a psychiatrist. In a\nDecember 1, 1993 affidavit, signed 11 years after the\nconvictions, Dr. Jones opined that:\n\n       Mr. Deere was competent in the limited sense\n       of knowing what was going on around him, so\n       that he understood the nature of the criminal\n\f36                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n       proceedings; however, Mr. Deere\u2019s mental\n       disorders rendered him unable to assist\n       counsel in the conduct of a defense in a\n       rational manner. Mr. Deere\u2019s initial refusal to\n       cooperate with my evaluation of him and his\n       eventual failure to complete the testing were\n       themselves indicators of his inability to\n       rationally cooperate in the presentation of a\n       defense. Mr. Deere simply was not able to\n       make logical judgments about his defense,\n       rather, he had a compulsion to be punished\n       with the death penalty and did not want\n       anyone to interfere with that. Mr. Deere\u2019s\n       insistence on pleading guilty was part of that\n       compulsion and an outgrowth of his mental\n       disturbances, it was irrational. It did not\n       appear to me that Mr. Deere was capable of\n       making a knowing, voluntary, intelligent\n       decision to so plead.\n\n       ***\n\n       In sum, it appeared to me that Mr. Deere was\n       so bent on self-destruction that it disabled him\n       from cooperating in a meaningful way with\n       the presentation of a defense and caused him\n       to solicit the death penalty.\n\nDeere v. Woodford, 339 F.3d 1084, 1085 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(Deere I). Dr. Jones later testified at his deposition that\nDeere\u2019s desire to accept responsibility for his crimes \u201cwas\nprobably substantially based on the self-destructive aspect of\nhis personality.\u201d\n\f                         DEERE V . CULLEN                             37\n\n    Hired by habeas counsel, Dr. Rosenthal came on the\nscene in 1992 and examined and tested Deere 10 years after\nthe conviction. Dr. Rosenthal agreed with Dr. Jones that\nDeere could not \u201crationally\u201d assist in his defense in 1982\nbecause of his \u201ccompulsion to be punished with the death\npenalty\u201d and self-destructive personality.6\n\n    The district court (Judge Gary Taylor) denied Deere\u2019s\nhabeas petition, and did so without holding an evidentiary\nhearing. The court held that the state trial court\u2019s finding that\nDeere was competent was presumed correct and was\nsupported by the record. The court reasoned that the\nattorneys, mental health experts and trial judge all found\nDeere competent; Dr. Bolger\u2019s 1982 conclusions were\nconsistent with the 1982 report of Dr. Jones; the crimes did\nnot show incompetence; and Deere\u2019s behavior in 1982 and\n1986 did not provide any evidence of incompetence. Judge\nTaylor concluded that there was no evidence before the trial\ncourt to require a competence hearing.\n\n    The district court held that the newly-obtained mental\nhealth opinions, made 10 years after trial, could be\nconsidered, but that those opinions did not compel the\nrejection of the finding of Deere\u2019s competence. Both Drs.\nJones and Rosenthal based their opinions on what they\ndeemed to be Deere\u2019s unreasonable decision not to put on a\ndefense. However, they agreed that Deere was competent in\nthe sense that he understood the nature of the proceedings.\nThe fact that Deere desired an outcome that the doctors\n\n\n 6\n   Dr. Rosenthal did not testify about this 1993 report at the evidentiary\nhearing before Judge Snyder because he could not remember it. Dr.\nRosenthal also testified that he could not \u201canswer the question of whether\nMr. Deere was competent.\u201d\n\f38                        DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nbelieved to be irrational, Judge Taylor reasoned, did not make\nDeere incompetent to plead guilty.\n\n    In his habeas petition, Deere also claimed that he was\ndenied due process because, he said, Judge Metheny was\nhimself not mentally competent in 1986. Deere sought\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing on this point. The\ndistrict court denied this claim, reasoning that the record as a\nwhole did not show any evidence that Judge Metheny was\nincompetent, and none of the attorneys, not Mr. Jones, not\nMr. Landau, not the prosecutor, who were in the best position\nto assess competence, ever moved to recuse the judge.\nAlthough Judge Metheny may have made an initial misstep\nwhen confronted with Mr. Jones\u2019s refusal to present\nmitigation after the case had been remanded for exactly that\npurpose, any error was understandable given the novel nature\nof the circumstances.          This did not show mental\nincompetence.7\n\n\n  7\n    The district court also rejected a sufficiency of the evidence claim for\nthe first degree murder conviction and related ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim because Deere:\n\n         walked a great distance with the murder weapon, broke\n         into the house to wait for Donald Davis to return, had\n         considered the consequences for the homicide on a\n         prior occasion, had threatened to kill the whole family,\n         and had told others that he was going to do\n         something. . . .\n\n     Similarly, the district court held that counsel was not ineffective for\nnot presenting mental state evidence because Deere was competent,\nadamantly opposed the evidence, refused to consider a plea of guilty by\nreason of insanity or mental health defenses and insisted on pleading\nguilty and seeking the death penalty against defense counsel\u2019s advice. As\nMr. Jones advised the court, he had an ethical duty to follow Deere\u2019s\n\f                        DEERE V . CULLEN                      39\n\n    The district court denied the habeas petition in its entirety\nand Deere appealed. In 2003, the first time this case was\nbefore us, we remanded it for an evidentiary hearing on the\nquestion of Deere\u2019s competency to plead guilty and the\nclaims premised on that issue. We wrote that:\n\n          [W]e agree with Deere that he came forward\n          with sufficient evidence at least to trigger a\n          hearing on whether he was, in fact, competent\n          to have pleaded guilty. We do not quarrel with\n          the district court\u2019s statement that Dr.\n          Rosenthal\u2019s \u201cconclusions cannot be awarded\n          as much weight as that given to Dr. Jones\u2019\n          examination which occurred around the time\n          of the trial.\u201d Belated opinions of mental health\n          experts are of dubious probative value and\n          therefore, disfavored. See Williams, 306 F.3d\n          at 706. (\u201c[W]e disfavor retrospective\n          determinations of incompetence, and give\n          considerable weight to the lack of\n          contemporaneous evidence of a petitioner\u2019s\n          incompetence to stand trial.\u201d) (citation\n          omitted).\n\n              Dr. Jones\u2019s declaration, however, stands\n          on different footing. It is based on his two\n          examinations of Deere, which he performed in\n          1982, within several days of when Deere\n          pleaded guilty. It is, therefore, probative of\n          Deere\u2019s mental status at the critical time. Dr.\n          Jones also offered a reasonable explanation\n          for why he did not render an opinion on\n\n\nwishes.\n\f40                  DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n       Deere\u2019s competency right then and there: He\n       was told by Lawyer Jones not to. Viewed\n       together, the declarations of Drs. Jones and\n       Rosenthal \u201ccreate a real and substantial\n       doubt\u201d as to Deere\u2019s competency to plead\n       guilty, if they are taken at face value and\n       assumed to be true.\n\n           We express no opinion on how the district\n       court should weigh the evidence after hearing\n       it. We simply hold that a hearing was\n       required. We remand to the district court with\n       directions to hold a hearing on Deere's claim\n       that he was incompetent to plead guilty, and\n       to reconsider the petition for writ of habeas\n       corpus as to the claims premised on that\n       contention. This court will rule on the other\n       issues raised in petitioner\u2019s appeal if and\n       when the case is re-appealed.\n\nDeere, 339 F.3d at 1086\u201387.\n\n   Judge Snyder took over the case from Judge Taylor and\nconducted an evidentiary hearing in 2007. Deere v. Cullen,\n713 F. Supp. 2d 1011, 1015 (C.D. Cal. 2010).\n\n    At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Jones testified that he\nexamined and tested Deere for a total of two hours in 1982.\nHis 1982 diagnosis of borderline personality disorder was\nsupported by Deere\u2019s self-mutilation and suicidal behavior.\nThat same self-destructive behavior motivated Deere to seek\nthe death penalty and waive presentation of mitigating\nevidence. Dr. Jones opined that Deere \u201c[knew] what was\ngoing on around him so that he understood the nature of the\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      41\n\ncriminal proceedings\u201d in 1982. But, Dr. Jones opined, Deere\nwas \u201cunable to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a\nrational manner\u201d in 1982. In other words, Deere was\n\u201cstrongly motivated\u201d to seek the death penalty by his self-\ndestructive needs.\n\n    Dr. Jones testified he \u201chad reservations about\u201d Deere\u2019s\ncompetence in 1982 because of Deere\u2019s \u201cself-destructive\nbehavior.\u201d But, Dr. Jones did not \u201carrive at . . . an opinion\nwith respect to Deere\u2019s competency\u201d in 1982. Dr. Jones\ntestified that he advised Mr. Jones in 1982 that Deere\u2019s\ndecision to plead guilty was a continuation of his impulsive\nlifestyle. However, Dr. Jones stated in his deposition that he\ncould not remember if he advised Mr. Jones in 1982 that\nDeere might not be competent.\n\n    Armando Favazza, M.D., testified that habeas counsel\nhired him in 2004, 22 years after the guilty plea, to assess\nDeere based on the records. Dr. Favazza never met with or\ntested Deere, but nevertheless opined at the evidentiary\nhearing that he would not have diagnosed the borderline\npersonality disorder (the diagnosis made by both Dr. Bolger\nand Dr. Jones). Instead, he would have diagnosed mild to\nsevere depression. Alcohol abuse, he opined, makes it\ndifficult to diagnose personality disorders. According to Dr.\nFavazza, Deere had \u201ca pathological fixed idea that he must be\nkilled.\u201d     This \u201cfixed idea\u201d \u201cprevented [Deere] from\ncooperating with his counsel.\u201d Dr. Favazza admitted, though,\nthat the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV, commonly\nknown as the DSM IV, does not recognize a mental illness of\n\u201cfixed\u201d or \u201cpathological\u201d death wish.\n\n   Dr. Rosenthal testified that he had been hired to evaluate\nDr. Bolger\u2019s qualifications and procedures. Based on Dr.\n\f42                        DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nBolger\u2019s two reports, his 1986 testimony and a 1986\ndeposition, Dr. Rosenthal testified he didn\u2019t think Dr. Bolger\nhad formally trained or was otherwise well-trained in\npsychiatry. Dr. Rosenthal stated, \u201c[Dr. Bolger] did claim to\nbe board certified in one of his transcripts which I find very\ntroubling because the letter in the files that I was provided\nfrom the board, the American Board of Psychiatry indicating\nthat Dr. Bolger had never been certified by that board.\u201d8\nTherefore, he did not believe that Dr. Bolger\u2019s report could be\nreliable.\n\n    Dr. Pablo Stewart, a psychiatrist who had never met or\ntested Deere, was hired by habeas counsel in 2006, 24 years\nafter Deere pled guilty. He opined that Deere suffered from\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and possibly organic\nbrain syndrome. Dr. Stewart acknowledged that the same\nsymptoms used to diagnose PTSD can establish a borderline\npersonality disorder. It was unclear, Dr. Stewart testified,\nwhether Deere had a major depressive disorder. Dr. Stewart\nopined that Deere\u2019s plea was \u201ccolored by\u201d his \u201cpsychiatric\ncondition.\u201d In other words, Deere\u2019s mental health \u201cinhibited\u201d\nhis ability to think rationally.\n\n    The state\u2019s expert, Park Dietz, M.D., Ph.D., did not meet\nwith or examine Deere, but not because he didn\u2019t try. The\nparties stipulated, and Judge Snyder ordered, that Dr. Dietz\nwould examine Deere at the prison, but Deere refused to\ncooperate. Dr. Dietz has been a board-certified psychiatrist\nsince 1979. He specializes in forensic psychiatry. Dr. Dietz\nagreed with both Drs. Jones and Bolger that Deere had\nborderline and anti-social personality disorders. The\nborderline personality disorder diagnosis was supported by\n\n 8\n     See Note 1, supra.\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                     43\n\nDeere\u2019s history of cutting himself; pattern of unstable\npersonal relationship; marked impulsivity; frantic efforts to\navoid real or imagined abandonment; unstable self-image;\nsubstance abuse; self-mutilation; emotional instability and\ninappropriate, intense anger. The anti-social personality\ndisorder was similarly supported by the record. Anti-social\npersonality disorder, which previously would have labeled\nDeere a sociopath, is not a psychotic state.\n\n    Dr. Dietz concluded that the 1982 and 1986 observations\nof Dr. Jones, defense counsel and Dr. Bolger established that\nDeere was competent to plead guilty in 1982. Specifically,\nDr. Dietz opined:\n\n       [Deere\u2019s] decisions were not made once,\n       without thinking, in an impulsive manner.\n       They were repeatedly and consistently made\n       over a period of time where he heard\n       alternative view points, was educated about\n       his options, had someone making an effort to\n       persuade him to take a different course of\n       action, and during which Mr. Deere himself\n       articulated his reasons for acting as he was\n       wishing. And articulated his personal values\n       and beliefs that were the basis for his\n       decision. That\u2019s not impulsivity and that\u2019s\n       not even the way borderline personalities\n       make their decision when they\u2019re being\n       symptomatic.\n\n   Dr. Dietz stated that the \u201cidea of execution or death is\nundesirable\u201d to most people. But he added:\n\f44                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n       In Mr. Deere\u2019s case, he indicated that he had\n       other values and goals that in his eyes made it\n       self-serving for him to seek and even desire\n       that he be executed. And those included his\n       expressed desire to demonstrate his humanity,\n       his expressed sense of justice, his expressed\n       desire to spare further pain to his family and\n       to his victims\u2019 family. And his expressed\n       desire to accept responsibility for his crimes.\n\n           If we credit him with the ability to hold\n       those values and to espouse those goals and to\n       care more for living in those ways in the brief\n       span until execution, than for the value of life\n       itself, then we would have to say that in his\n       case he is asserting his goals in the service of\n       himself that to him outweigh the obvious self-\n       destructive function of permitting oneself to\n       be executed.\n\n    Dr. Dietz said that \u201cself-harm syndrome\u201d or life-long\ndeath wish diagnosis is not a diagnosis recognized by the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association or listed in the DSM IV.\nIn any case, Dr. Dietz said that the same symptoms support\nthe borderline personality disorder diagnosed by Drs. Jones\nand Bolger.\n\n    Dr. Dietz disagreed with Dr. Jones\u2019s 1993 opinion that\nDeere had an \u201cirrational compulsion\u201d to seek the death\npenalty. Dr. Dietz opined that even repeated suicide attempts\ndo not warrant a diagnosis of a \u201ccompulsion\u201d as the term is\nused in psychiatry. He said that the evidence in this case did\nnot rise to the level of a compulsion.\n\f                          DEERE V . CULLEN                             45\n\n   After the evidentiary hearing, the court found that there\nwas \u201cno conclusive understanding of the nature and degree of\n[Deere\u2019s] mental illness.\u201d It then offered Deere an\nopportunity to provide additional evidence to establish that a\nmental illness prevented him from assisting in his defense.\nAlthough the parties agreed that two experts, Drs. Stewart\nand Dietz, would jointly examine Deere, Deere again refused\nto cooperate. Therefore, the court ruled without the\nadditional evidence. Deere, 713 F. Supp. 2d at 1015\u201316.\n\n    The district court granted the habeas petition on the\ngrounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held\nthat Mr. Jones had performed below the objective standard of\nreasonableness in failing to request a full-blown competency\nhearing before Deere pled guilty. Id. at 1029\u201330. Further, it\nalso held that Deere was prejudiced by this failing because\nthere was a reasonable probability that he would have been\nfound incompetent had Mr. Jones adequately developed the\nissue at the time of Deere\u2019s guilty plea. Id. at 1041. Notably,\nhaving decided the case on this basis, the court specifically\ndeclined to \u201creach Deere\u2019s claim of actual incompetence.\u201d\nId.\n\n    In coming to this conclusion, the court rejected Dr.\nBolger\u2019s 1982 opinions, finding that \u201cDr. Bolger had no\nformal psychiatric training whatsoever,9 misrepresented to the\nCourt that he was board certified, and failed to disclose\u201d that\nhe \u201chad a prior relationship with Deere\u2019s father as his treating\nphysician and had previously interviewed Deere in that\n\n\n   9\n     This finding is dubious because it is based on Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s\nspeculation about Dr. Bolger\u2019s training. The record simply does not\ncontain details about the training beyond the fact that he trained and then\nwas officially designated a psychiatrist in the California prison system.\n\f46                        DEERE V . CULLEN\n\ncapacity.\u201d10 Id. at 1023, 1034. The court gave \u201csubstantial\nweight\u201d to Dr. Jones\u2019s 1992 opinion, but also considered the\nexpert opinions of Drs. Favazza, Stewart and Dietz. Id. at\n1036.\n\n    The district court vacated Deere\u2019s convictions and\nsentences, id. at 1043, but stayed the order pending appeal.\nThe state timely appealed.\n\nII. Jurisdiction and Standards of Review\n\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We\nreview the district court\u2019s grant or denial of the habeas\nclaims, the ineffective assistance of counsel claims and\ncompetence claims de novo. We review a district court\u2019s\nfindings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s refusal\nto hold an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.\nWilliams v. Woodford, 384 F.3d 567, 586, 608 (9th Cir.\n2004).\n\n    State court findings of fact, including findings made by\nappellate courts based on reviews of the record, are entitled\nto a presumption of correctness and are reviewed for clear\nerror. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8) (1996); Sumner v. Mata,\n449 U.S. 539, 545\u201347, 550 (1981); Jeffries v. Blodgett, 5 F.3d\n1180, 1187 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n\n 10\n    Specifically, Dr. Bolger had treated Deere\u2019s father for seizures at the\nBlythe hospital in 1981 and had taken a family history about the father\u2019s\nalcoholism from Deere. Dr. Bolger\u2019s prior experience with the Deeres is\nnot mentioned in his 1982 reports. In 1986, Bolger denied knowing Deere\npreviously, but is not clear why Dr. Bolger should have been expected to\nremember in 1986 that he had met Deere five years earlier, before the\nevents of this case, while treating his father.\n\f                        DEERE V . CULLEN                           47\n\n    The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act does\nnot apply to this habeas petition because the original petition\nwas filed in 1993. Williams, 384 F.3d at 586. Thus, we grant\nhabeas relief if Deere proves by a preponderance of the\nevidence that he \u201cis in custody in violation of the Constitution\nor laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a)\n(1996).\n\nIII.    Deere\u2019s competence to plea guilty and stand trial\n        and related ineffective assistance of counsel claim\n\n    Many of Deere\u2019s claims revolve around his competence\nduring the 1982 and 1986 proceedings. Deere was competent\nto plead guilty and stand trial if he had \u201csufficient present\nability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding\u201d and \u201ca rational as well as factual\nunderstanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Godinez v.\nMoran, 509 U.S. 389, 396\u201398 (1993); Drope v. Missouri,\n420 U.S. 162, 172 (1975); Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S.\n402, 402 (1960) (per curiam).11 Competence \u201chas a modest\naim: It seeks to ensure that [the defendant] has the capacity to\nunderstand the proceedings and to assist counsel.\u201d Godinez,\n509 at 402.\n\n    The state courts\u2019 repeated findings that Deere was\ncompetent to plead guilty and stand trial in 1982 and 1986 are\npresumed to be correct if they are fairly supported by the\nrecord. Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U.S. 731, 735 (1990);\nMaggio v. Fulford, 462 U.S. 111, 116\u201317 (1983) (per\ncuriam); Evans, 800 F.2d at 887. No formal evidentiary\n\n\n   11\n      W hen Deere pled guilty in 1982, California applied the same\ncompetence standard. Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1367 (1982); Deere, 710 P.2d at\n927; People v. Jablonski, 126 P.3d 938, 961 (Cal. 2006).\n\f48                        DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nhearing is required for the presumption to apply. Mata,\n449 U.S. at 545\u201346. Deere must come forward with clear and\nconvincing evidence to rebut the presumption. Id. at 550.\n\n    The question on this aspect of the case boils down to this:\nwhether Deere suffered any prejudice from the lack of a\ncompetency hearing, even assuming for the sake of argument\nthat Mr. Jones should have moved for one? Put another way,\nwas there a reasonable probability that he would have been\nfound incompetent to plead guilty? Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984); Stanley v. Cullen, 633 F.3d 852,\n862 (9th Cir. 2011). We review this question on a de novo\nbasis. Williams, 384 F.3d at 586. After carefully reviewing\nthe record, including the district court\u2019s factual findings that\nwe accept as true, we hold that there is no reasonable\nprobability that Deere would have been found incompetent to\nenter his plea.\n\n    Furthermore, the state court\u2019s finding that Deere was in\nfact competent is presumed correct and has not been rebutted\nby clear and convincing evidence. Evans, 800 F.2d at 887.\nFirst, all of the mental health experts, even the Johnny-come-\nlatelies, agree that Deere had the ability to understand and\nactually understood the nature and object of the proceedings\nagainst him.12 The reports of both mental health experts who\nexamined Deere in 1982 establish that Deere understood the\nproceedings and was able to cooperate with counsel. The\nreports of Drs. Bolger and Jones are remarkable for the\n\n\n  12\n      As the Supreme Court explained in Godinez, competence requires\nonly the ability to rationally understand. In contrast, the plea is knowing\nif the defendant actually understands the proceedings. Godinez, 509 U.S.\nat 401 n.12. Thus, the expert opinions that Deere understood the\nproceedings also demonstrate that Deere\u2019s plea was knowing.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      49\n\nsimilarity of their conclusions. Both doctors opined that\nDeere understood the proceedings, was oriented to time, place\nand person and was free of thought disorders. Both experts\ndiagnosed Deere with substance abuse and personality\ndisorders with antisocial aspects. Dr. Jones also diagnosed\nadjustment disorder. No mental health expert has ever found\nDeere to be delusional, paranoid or psychotic. Dr. Bolger\nalso opined that Deere was capable of working with counsel\nif it benefitted him to do so.\n\n    In 2010, Judge Snyder found that Dr. Bolger, who had\ndied 23 years earlier and was no longer around to defend\nhimself, was not a competent psychiatrist. Never mind that\nBolger trained in psychiatry at a state hospital for several\nyears, was the staff psychiatrist at a state prison for several\nyears more and had a private psychiatric practice after that.\nEven if the court\u2019s finding about Dr. Bolger is entitled to\ndeference, it is of little moment since Bolger\u2019s 1982 opinions\nwere in almost complete lockstep with Dr. Jones\u2019s 1982\nopinions and entirely consistent with the observations of the\njudge and counsel. And those observations come down to\nthis: Deere knew what he was doing and had rational reasons\nfor doing it.\n\n    Second, Judge Metheny personally interacted with Deere\non numerous occasions at every hearing and repeatedly found\nthat Deere understood the proceedings and could cooperate\nwith counsel in a defense. During these interactions, Deere\nwas lucid, appropriately answered open-ended questions, and\nestablished his understanding of the proceedings and his\nability to consult with counsel. To repeat, the state court\u2019s\nfinding that Deere was competent is not only strongly\nsupported by the evidence, but presumed correct because\n\u201ccompetency determinations necessarily involve assessments\n\f50                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nof credibility and demeanor\u201d by the trial judge, and\n\u201ccompetency may be examined in open court on a full\nrecord.\u201d Evans, 800 F.2d at 887. Judge Metheny repeatedly\nobserved and evaluated Deere\u2019s competence in 1982 and\n1986. His observation that Deere was competent is presumed\ncorrect and strongly supported by the record. Id.; Maggio,\n462 U.S. at 117\u201318. It certainly has not been rebutted by\nclear and convincing evidence.\n\n    Third, defense counsel, who spent a great deal of time\ndiscussing the issues with Deere, had no doubt that Deere was\nlegally competent, rational and could cooperate in his defense\nif he wanted to. Although\u2019s Deere\u2019s psychiatric diagnosis is\na medical question, his competence to plead guilty is a legal\none that judges and lawyers deal with all the time. Deere and\nMr. Jones conferred for countless hours before the plea was\nentered. It was apparent to Mr. Jones that Deere understood\nthe proceedings and his various options but wanted to plead\nguilty for the reasons already stated: he wanted to spare his\nfamily; he wanted to minimize the trauma to the survivors;\nand he thought a guilty plea and possible death sentence was\njust under the circumstances. These are not irrational\nconsiderations. Mr. Jones was uniquely positioned to assess\nDeere\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings and his legal\noptions. Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437, 450 (1992);\nWilliams, 384 F.3d at 606. Thus, Mr. Jones\u2019s opinion is\n\u201cespecially relevant\u201d and provides \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that\nDeere was competent. Williams, 384 F.3d at 608.\n\n    Fourth, the prosecutor believed that Deere was competent\nin 1982 and 1986.\n\n    Fifth, the facts of the crimes do not suggest legal\nincompetence or someone out of touch with reality. Deere\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      51\n\nrepeatedly threatened to kill Cindy\u2019s family. Then, after she\nleft him, he planned the murder for a few days, again warned\nCindy and then carried out that murder.\n\n    Sixth, the transcripts of the guilty plea proceedings\nestablish that Deere actually understood what was going on.\nDeere accurately answered open-ended questions from the\njudge, consulted with his counsel in court and demonstrated\nhis understanding of the proceedings, his waivers and the\npossible results of his actions. He was articulate, repentant\nand logical in the courtroom. Deere\u2019s \u201ccomprehension of the\nlegal significance\u201d of his actions, including the withdrawal of\nhis not guilty plea, \u201cindicated that he had the ability to\nconsult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational\nunderstanding.\u201d Williams, 384 F.3d at 605.\n\n    Finally, as noted already, Deere had rational reasons for\npleading guilty. As the California Supreme Court found,\nDeere \u201cfelt great remorse for his offenses and was prepared\nto suffer the consequences of a judgment of death.\u201d Deere,\n710 P.2d at 927.\n\n    Eleven years after Deere pled guilty, habeas counsel came\nforward with newly-obtained opinions to the effect that\nDeere\u2019s plea was motivated by an irrational desire to be put\nto death, rendering him incompetent and his plea invalid,\nwhether or not he understood his situation and the\nramifications of his decision. This evidence is of little\nconsequence for two reasons:\n\n    First, as we pointed out in Deere I, \u201c[b]elated opinions of\nmental health experts are of dubious probative value and\ntherefore disfavored.\u201d 339 F.3d at 1086.\n\f52                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n     Second, even if these belated opinions are credited, what\nmatters is not whether Deere had a mental illness that\naffected his decision, but whether he had a mental illness that\naffected his capacity to understand his situation and make\nrational choices. Dennis v. Budge, 378 F.3d 880 (9th Cir.\n2004), involves a case with strikingly similar facts. Dennis\npled guilty to capital murder and was sentenced to death. He\nsought and was granted leave to withdraw his state habeas\nappeal. Id. at 882\u201383. A \u201cnext friend\u201d federal habeas\npetition was filed arguing that Dennis was incompetent to\nhave made these decisions due to mental illness. Id. at\n886\u201387. A psychiatrist opined that Dennis \u201ckilled the victim\nand is seeking the death penalty as a convenient way out of\nlife, and a way of assuring himself that ultimately he will\ndie.\u201d Id. at 883. Nevertheless, the psychiatrist opined that\nDennis had sufficient understanding of the proceedings to\nconsult with counsel and had a rational and factual\nunderstanding of the proceedings. He was fully aware of the\ncharges, the implications of the sentence, and the legal\noptions available to him. Id. We held:\n\n       The question . . . is not whether mental illness\n       substantially affects a decision, but whether a\n       mental disease, disorder or defect\n       substantially affects the prisoner\u2019s capacity to\n       appreciate his options and make a rational\n       choice among them . . . A \u201crational choice\u201d\n       does not mean a sensible decision, or a\n       decision that the next friend regards as\n       reasonable.\n\nId. at 890 (emphasis in original).\n\f                          DEERE V . CULLEN                             53\n\n    Thus, because it is undisputed that Deere was fully aware\nof his situation and had rational reasons for his desire to plead\nguilty \u2013 in other words, that he had \u201cthe capacity to appreciate\nhis options and make a rational choice\u201d \u2013 it is not reasonably\nprobable that he would have been found incompetent to plead\nguilty under the proper legal standard, even if his new-found\nexperts had opined at a competency hearing in 1982 as they\ndo now. We reverse Judge Snyder\u2019s order granting a writ of\nhabeas corpus on this ground.13\n\n   We now turn to the order issued by Judge Taylor denying\nhabeas relief on the other grounds raised by Deere.\n\n\n\n\n  13\n      Deere\u2019s claim that the trial judge should have sua sponte held a\ncompetency hearing in 1982 fails because there was no evidence of his\nincompetence before the trial judge. Judge Metheny, the prosecutor and\nMr. Jones all believed that Deere was competent. Deere\u2019s actions in court\nestablished that he understood the charges, understood the possible\nsentences, had extensively discussed his case with counsel, could state a\nfactual basis for the plea, understood the rights he was waiving and could\nconsult with counsel. He also gave rational reasons for pleading guilty\nand waiving a jury trial and his constitutional rights. Finally, the court-\nappointed psychiatrist found Deere competent, and both counsel stipulated\nto that competence finding. The trial court was entitled to rely on the\ncompetency determination. Wallace v. Stewart, 184 F.3d 1112, 1118 (9th\nCir. 1999). The record before the trial judge simply did not raise a bona\nfide doubt about Deere\u2019s competence to warrant a sua sponte hearing.\n\n     Deere\u2019s claim that he was actually incompetent to plead guilty and\nstand trial fails because the state court\u2019s multiple, repeated competence\nfindings are well-supported by the record. The new evidence, which we\ndisfavor, simply does not provide the clear and convincing evidence\nnecessary to overcome all of the evidence establishing that Deere was\ncompetent in 1982 and 1986.\n\f54                     DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nIV.     Trial judge\u2019s mental competency in 1986\n\n    Deere argues that the district court abused its discretion\nby denying his request for discovery and an evidentiary\nhearing on his claim that counsel was ineffective for not\nchallenging Judge Metheny\u2019s competency to preside at the\n1986 penalty retrial. We review the district court\u2019s denial of\nan evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. Williams,\n384 F.3d at 586. The district court must conduct an\nevidentiary hearing if the facts are disputed, the facts alleged\nwould entitle the petitioner to habeas relief, if true, and if the\npetitioner did not receive a full and fair opportunity to\ndevelop the facts in state court. Id.\n\n    We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin finding that Deere did not come forward with sufficient\nevidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n\n    The essence of Deere\u2019s claim is that in 1986, Judge\nMetheny was senile and that Mr. Jones rendered ineffective\nassistance of counsel in failing to attempt to disqualify him.\nDeere\u2019s habeas counsel admit that they did not have enough\nproof to sustain this claim, but they argue they came forward\nwith enough to entitle them to discovery and an evidentiary\nhearing. They offered the following:\n\n    1. After the case was remanded by the California\nSupreme Court for the presentation of mitigating evidence,\nand after Mr. Jones still refused at Deere\u2019s insistence to offer\nmitigation, Judge Metheny held Mr. Jones in contempt and\nreimposed the death sentence. He then purported to \u201cstay\u201d\nthe sentence and appointed a private investigator to develop\nmitigation. Mr. Jones objected to this, and ultimately the\nCalifornia Supreme Court struck the order and returned the\n\f                          DEERE V .

Deere argues that Judge\nMetheny\u2019s ruling is evidence of not just legal error, but\nmental impairment.\n\n    2. Deere also points to certain statements Judge Metheny\nmade at the time of sentencing as indicative of mental\nimpairment. Deere argues that Judge Metheny \u201cemployed\nbizarre reasoning\u201d by comparing Deere\u2019s murders to mafia\nhits,15 soldiers shooting enemies during the war and\nindividuals shooting judges.16 The judge also compared Deere\n\n\n 14\n      Deere, 808 P.2d at 1187 n.4.\n\n 15\n      Judge Metheny stated:\n\n          You might say what was committed here certainly was\n          not an extensive crime. It had to do with an emotional\n          situation. It has to do with the murder of people\n          knowing one another. You can\u2019t compare it with\n          organized crime . . . where somebody was hired to go\n          out and shoot people. . .\n\n 16\n          THE COURT: . . .Can you think of anything sadder you\n          could do to a mother or father \u2013 a mother in this case.\n          Losing a husband and two kids?\n\n          THE DEFENDANT: No.\n\n          THE COURT: M e either. I\u2019ve thought about that. I\u2019ve\n          thought about it a lot. W hen you go out and shoot\n          somebody with a rifle \u2013 when you\u2019re in the service, it\n          doesn\u2019t hurt you too much because you\u2019re told that is\n          right. But stripping away the life of children and a\n          husband from somebody that wasn\u2019t directly connected\n\f56                      DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nto himself, noting that he was angry when he lost a girlfriend\nduring the war.\n\n    3. Deere also furnished declarations from four lawyers.\nTaylor Huff signed a declaration in 1993. He is a former\npublic defender in Indio. He furnished a copy of a ruling\nJudge Metheny made in 1985 on a motion to suppress that\nHuff offered as proof of the judge\u2019s mental impairment.\nHowever, there is no explanation of how the ruling evidenced\nmental impairment or even in what way it was wrong. Huff\nexpressed his opinion that Judge Metheny had difficulty\ngrasping the legal concepts involved in that case, but\nprovided no details. Huff also offered his opinion that Judge\nMetheny\u2019s faculties seemed to have deteriorated over the\nyears. Huff declared that he had appeared before Judge\nMetheny five to ten times, but never sought his\ndisqualification.\n\n    Michael Kennedy, a public defender in San Bernardino\nCounty, furnished a declaration in 1993 stating that he had\nheard \u201crumors\u201d as early as 1985 that the judge had\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease. Kenney states that in 1988 \u2013 two years\nafter Deere was resentenced \u2013 he saw Judge Metheny, a\nformer college football player, come down from the bench\nafter an evidentiary objection, assume a football stance and\nchallenge him. Kennedy speculates that Judge Metheny was\nhaving a flashback to his days as a college football player.\nAfter Kennedy moved for Judge Metheny\u2019s disqualification,\nMetheny \u201cappeared to snap back into the present\u201d and\n\n\n       to you, that puts that into the aggravating circumstances\n       to the extent that everything else I say is a bunch of\n       nonsense. If you shot the Judge, it might have been\n       different.\n\f                        DEERE V . CULLEN                          57\n\napologetically disqualified himself. Kennedy had never\nappeared before Judge Metheny prior to 1988.\n\n    Mark Sullivan declared in 1993 that in 1984 Judge\nMetheny made \u201cstrange rulings and off-hand remarks\u201d in a\ncivil case. In 1986, Judge Metheny was presiding over a\nsmall claims appeal that was only supposed to have taken a\ncouple of hours. When it dragged on for three days, Judge\nMetheny, apparently exasperated, came down from the bench,\nsaid that both sides were good Christian people, that they\nshould settle the dispute, and then he dismissed the case. The\nmatter was reinstated by the presiding judge. Sullivan stated\nthat in his opinion, Judge Metheny was not competent to\nhandle the responsibilities of a judge since 1983.\n\n    Finally, Diane Samuelson, one of Deere\u2019s current habeas\ncounsel, furnished a declaration stating that in 1993 \u2013 seven\nyears after Deere\u2019s sentencing \u2013 she unsuccessfully attempted\nto contact Judge Metheny. Ultimately, she received a phone\ncall from someone who identified herself as his wife who told\nSamuelson that the judge was ill, couldn\u2019t remember cases\nanyway, and had an Alzheimer\u2019s-type condition.\n\n    As noted above, the district court denied the request for\ndiscovery without prejudice,17 balancing this new evidence\nagainst the fact that neither Mr. Jones nor Mr. Landau ever\nmoved to recuse and the fact that the California Supreme\nCourt reviewed the record and found that the trial judge was\nfair, objective and carefully weighed mitigating and\n\n\n 17\n    Deere wanted to depose Judge M etheny, obtain his medical records\nand subpoena \u201cany relevant records of complaints lodged with the\nCommission on Judicial Performance between 1982 and 1988 against\u201d the\njudge.\n\f58                     DEERE V . CULLEN\n\naggravating factors at sentencing. Evidence obtained 11\nyears after the sentencing, the district court reasoned, would\nnot establish the judge\u2019s competency in 1986. Although the\nrequest for discovery was denied without prejudice, the\nrequest was never renewed.\n\n    The district court also denied the request for an\nevidentiary hearing because the evidence proffered, when\nviewed along with \u201cthe entire record,\u201d did not support\nDeere\u2019s allegation that the judge was incompetent. None of\nthe attorneys who actually appeared before Judge Metheny in\nthis case \u2013 Mr. Jones, Mr. Landau, the prosecutor and\nappellate defense counsel \u2013 ever questioned the trial judge\u2019s\nmental competence. These lawyers, the district court added,\nwere in the best position to observe the trial judge\u2019s behavior.\nIn addition, although Judge Metheny may have initially erred\nin his handling of Mr. Jones\u2019s refusal to put on mitigation, the\ndistrict court noted, \u201cthe fact that all the parties were breaking\nnew ground in this case. . . It is rare that a defendant pleads\nguilty in a death penalty case, and Petitioner created a novel\ndilemma when he declined to present any mitigating\nevidence.\u201d Neither the judge nor parties had experience with\nthe novel situation.\n\n    We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin denying an evidentiary hearing on the subject of Judge\nMetheny\u2019s mental competency in 1986. First, with respect to\nJudge Metheny\u2019s ruling when Mr. Jones refused to put on\nmitigation, a ruling later reversed, there is simply no evidence\n\u2013 none \u2013 that this ruling was other than legal error committed\nwhen the judge was confronted with a highly unusual\nsituation. Mr. Jones refused to present mitigation in a capital\ncase even after the case had been remanded by the California\nSupreme Court for that very purpose, even on pain of\n\f                          DEERE V . CULLEN                              59\n\ncontempt. Judge Metheny was sailing in unchartered waters.\nHis procedure of reimposing the death penalty, and then\nstaying it for further mitigation was error. After this error\nwas corrected on appeal, the case was remanded to Judge\nMetheny and it proceeded to conclusion without further ado\nand it was affirmed on appeal. Legal error, especially in the\ncontext of highly unusual circumstances, is not evidence of\nsenility.\n\n    The out-of-context excerpts of Judge Metheny\u2019s remarks\nat Deere\u2019s 1986 sentencing prove only that Judge Metheny\nwas not the most articulate of men. However, when Judge\nMetheny\u2019s remarks are read in context and not in isolated\nsnippets, it is apparent that he was trying to make the\nlegitimate point that he could empathize with Deere about the\npain of being jilted by a girlfriend. He was also explaining\nthat he had to consider the facts of the crimes to determine\nthe sentence. He was making the point that Deere committed\nan emotional crime, rather than a murder for hire. And that\neven though Deere was intoxicated and upset, he had\nnevertheless planned the murder; it was not an accident, like\ndrunk driving, nor was it a spur-of-the-moment killing.18\n\n\n\n\n  18\n     The dissent (but not Deere) argues that Judge Metheny exhibited\n\u201cmental incompetence\u201d at the penalty phase as evidenced by a discussion\nin which defense counsel requested that the judge rule that the aggravating\nevidence \u201coutweighed\u201d the mitigating evidence, all before any mitigating\nevidence was even presented. After Judge Metheny (and the prosecutor)\nexpressed confusion about this request and sought clarification of what\ndefense counsel was really seeking \u2013 basically, a ruling that the\naggravating evidence was insufficient as a matter of law \u2013 Judge Metheny\ndenied the request and required the presentation of mitigation, a ruling not\ndisturbed on appeal.\n\f60                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n   Although Deere\u2019s lawyers argue that Judge Metheny\u2019s\nremarks are evidence of mental impairment, conspicuously\nmissing from their submission is anything from any of their\ndoctors. Despite having access to a veritable stable of mental\nhealth professionals who could have reviewed the transcripts\n\u2013 Dr. Jones, Dr. Rosenthal, Dr. Favazza, Dr. Stewart \u2013 not\none has opined that Judge Metheny\u2019s statements are evidence\nof a disordered mind, or even that they warrant further\ninquiry.\n\n    The declarations of the lawyers recounting anecdotes also\ndo not provide a basis for a hearing. Taylor Huff\u2019s\ndeclaration boils down to his personal opinion that Judge\nMetheny \u201chad difficulty grasping\u201d the legal concepts\ninvolved in a 1985 motion to suppress. Huff is certainly\nentitled to his opinion, but it is not proof of the judge\u2019s\nmental impairment, especially since there is no specific\nexplanation of what the problem supposedly was. Judge\nMetheny\u2019s ruling attached to Huff\u2019s declaration is\nunremarkable on its face, and there is not even an allegation\nthat it was ever found to be legally erroneous. Huff\u2019s\ndeclaration does not warrant a hearing.\n\n    Michael Kennedy\u2019s declaration speaks of \u201crumors\u201d he\u2019d\nheard about Judge Metheny around 1985. Rumors do not\nwarrant a hearing. The football incident occurred in 1988 \u2013\ntwo years after Deere\u2019s sentencing. At best, the football\nincident sheds light on Judge Metheny\u2019s status at that time,\nnot in 1986. In fact, Kennedy says he never even appeared\nbefore Judge Metheny until 1988. His observations two years\nafter the time in question do not warrant a hearing.\n\n    Mark Sullivan\u2019s declaration speaks of \u201cstrange rulings,\u201d\nnot otherwise identified, made by Judge Metheny in a civil\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      61\n\ncase in 1984. It also recounts an inexplicable statement that\nthe judge made to the jury to the effect that Sullivan\u2019s wife\nhad complained to the judge about Sullivan\u2019s staying out too\nlate at night. No transcript was furnished, so it is impossible\nto tell whether this statement was an attempt at humor, the\nproduct of confusion, or something else. In any event, this\none stray remark, without any context in a 1984 trial, does not\nwarrant a hearing. The 1986 event in which the judge\nabruptly dismissed a small claims appeal that was supposed\nto have taken just a few hours, but went on for three days,\nshows a judge who became exasperated and blew his stack.\nAlthough this is evidence of impatience, it is not hard to\nunderstand how or why the incident happened. Once again,\nDeere has failed to furnish anything from any of his several\nmental health experts ascribing any clinical significance to\nthis incident.\n\n    The substance of Diana Samuelson\u2019s declaration quoting\nthe woman who identified herself as Judge Metheny\u2019s wife in\n1993 is hearsay. Even if it weren\u2019t, the woman\u2019s statements\nspeak only to Judge Metheny\u2019s condition in February 1993,\nand say nothing about his status in 1986.\n\n    Deere\u2019s habeas counsel accuse Mr. Jones of ineffective\nassistance of counsel for failing to move to disqualify Judge\nMetheny, yet offer no evidence whatsoever that Huff,\nKennedy or Sullivan ever shared their opinions of Judge\nMetheny with Mr. Jones or passed along the gossip and\nrumors they included in their declarations. In evaluating Mr.\nJones, we look to what he knew in 1986. Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 689.\n\n   Finally, and most importantly, on May 2, 1991, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court affirmed, without dissent, Judge\n\f62                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nMetheny\u2019s handling of the 1986 proceeding \u2013 the proceeding\nDeere now argues was affected by the judge\u2019s mental\nimpairments. Not only was Judge Metheny affirmed in toto,\nbut the Supreme Court even specifically observed that \u201cthe\nrecord indicates that the trial court remained scrupulously fair\nand objective throughout the proceedings. It carefully\nweighed and considered both the aggravating and mitigating\nevidence after they were presented.\u201d Deere, 808 P.2d at\n1195. Not only did the Supreme Court fail to express any\nconcern over Judge Metheny\u2019s statements or behavior, it\nexplicitly commended him on the way he handled the case.\nThis alone compels the conclusion that Judge Metheny was\nnot impaired when he presided over this case in 1986, and\nthat Mr. Jones was not ineffective in failing to seek his\ndisqualification.\n\n    The dissent says, \u201cThe majority holds that a judge\nsuffering from dementia may sentence a man to death.\u201d We\nhold no such thing. What we really hold is that the anecdotes\ndrummed up many years after the time in question do not\nsupport the claim that Judge Metheny was impaired in 1986,\nparticularly in light of the California Supreme Court\u2019s\nlaudatory affirmance of Judge Metheny\u2019s supposedly-\nimpaired 1986 rulings.\n\nV.

Deeply remorseful,\nDeere convinced deputy public defender Glenn Jones to help\nhim obtain a death sentence for his crimes. Deere pled guilty\nand waived a penalty-phase jury. Jones presented no\nmitigating evidence. Superior Court Judge Fred R. Metheny\nsentenced Deere to death in 1982. The California Supreme\nCourt reversed and remanded, holding that a death sentence\ncould not be imposed without the presentation of mitigating\nevidence. People v. Deere (Deere I), 710 P.2d 925 (Cal.\n1985). On remand in 1986, Jones again refused to present\nmitigating evidence. Judge Metheny again sentenced Deere\nto death, even though he had been specifically instructed by\nthe Supreme Court not to do so without hearing mitigating\nevidence. Judge Metheny held a second penalty hearing a\nfew months later, at which another attorney presented\n\n  19\n     The remaining claims Deere asserts on appeal were rejected by the\ndistrict court.

At that hearing, Judge Metheny\nsentenced Deere to death for the third time. The California\nSupreme Court affirmed. People v. Deere (Deere II),\n808 P.2d 1181 (Cal. 1991).\n\n    When Judge Metheny resentenced Deere to death in 1986,\nhe was mentally incompetent. Three attorneys who appeared\nbefore Judge Metheny during this period provided affidavits\nin support of Deere\u2019s state and federal habeas petitions. The\nattorneys describe Judge Metheny as incompetent and report\nthat his incompetence was general knowledge in the\ncourthouse. The record of Deere\u2019s resentencing also shows\nJudge Metheny\u2019s incompetence.\n\n    I believe the evidence already in the record is sufficient to\ndemonstrate that Judge Metheny was mentally incompetent\nwhen he resentenced Deere to death in 1986, but that is not\nthe question before us today. The question now before us is\nmuch easier: Should the district court have granted an\nevidentiary hearing on Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence?\nThe majority holds that such a hearing was not required. I\ndisagree.\n\n    It is an open secret that some judges stay on the bench too\nlong. Formal procedures exist for removing senile judges,\nbut they are rarely employed. Attorneys hesitate to challenge\njudges they appear before, and judges hesitate to blow the\nwhistle on their colleagues. I am as reluctant as most judges\nto seek to remove a senile judge or to set aside a decision\nreached by such a judge. But when a man\u2019s life is at stake, I\ncannot stay silent.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                        65\n\n                 I. Procedural Background\n\n    Deere filed a federal habeas corpus petition in 1993,\nbefore the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Two federal district judges\nhave dealt with his petition. District Judge Taylor denied\nDeere\u2019s petition in its entirety in 2001. On appeal from that\ndenial, we wrote that Deere had \u201cc[o]me forward with\nsufficient evidence at least to trigger a hearing on whether he\nwas, in fact, competent to have pleaded guilty.\u201d Deere v.\nWoodford, 339 F.3d 1084, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003). We held that\ntwo declarations \u201c\u2018create[d] a real and substantial doubt\u2019 as\nto Deere\u2019s competency to plead guilty, if they [were] taken at\nface value and assumed to be true.\u201d Id. at 1087 (quoting\nBoag v. Raines, 769 F.2d 1341, 1343 (9th Cir. 1985). We\nremanded for a hearing \u201con Deere\u2019s claim that he was\nincompetent to plead guilty, and to reconsider the petition . . .\nas to the claims premised on that contention.\u201d Id. We did not\nreach any other issues, including Judge Metheny\u2019s\ncompetence in 1986.\n\n    District Judge Snyder conducted the hearing on remand.\nIn a careful forty-nine-page order, she concluded that Jones\nprovided ineffective assistance of counsel (\u201cIAC\u201d). She held\nthat Jones fell below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness\nand performed below the professional standard in his\ncommunity at the time\u201d when he failed to investigate Deere\u2019s\ncompetence to plead guilty. She held that Deere was\nprejudiced because there was a \u201creasonable probability that,\nbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\u201d Deere would have\nbeen found incompetent.\n\n   The State appeals Judge Snyder\u2019s decision.

I disagree\nwith the majority on three issues.\n\n     First, I would hold that the district court should have\ngranted an evidentiary hearing on whether Judge Metheny\nwas mentally competent when he sentenced Deere to death in\n1986. Second, I would hold that the district court should\nhave granted an evidentiary hearing on whether Jones\nprovided IAC in failing to challenge Judge Metheny\u2019s\ncompetence in 1986. Third, agreeing with Judge Snyder, I\nwould hold that Jones provided ineffective assistance in\nfailing to investigate Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty in\n1982.\n\n       II. Judge Metheny\u2019s Competence in 1986\n\n              A. Evidence of Incompetence\n\n    Judge Metheny first sentenced Deere to death in 1982.\nThe California Supreme Court reversed the death sentence\nbecause Jones had refused to present mitigating evidence and\nJudge Metheny had imposed the sentence without requiring\nJones to do so. Deere I, 710 P.2d at 934. The Court\nremanded for a new sentencing hearing, holding that a death\nsentence could not be imposed in the absence of mitigating\nevidence. Id.\n\n    Judge Metheny conducted two resentencing hearings after\nremand. At the first hearing, held on April 21, 1986, Jones\nagain refused to present mitigating evidence. Judge Metheny\ndid not require mitigating evidence and sentenced Deere to\ndeath the next day. On May 14, Judge Metheny \u201cstayed\u201d the\nnew death sentence by minute order. Even though stayed, the\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                       67\n\ndeath sentence triggered an automatic appeal to the California\nSupreme Court. On June 9, the Court struck the judgment of\ndeath and \u201creturned [the case] to the superior court for further\nproceedings.\u201d\n\n    On June 27, 1986, Judge Metheny appointed attorney\nJonathan Landau to present mitigating evidence on Deere\u2019s\nbehalf as a friend of the court. A second resentencing hearing\nwas held on July 18, 1986, at which Landau presented\nmitigating evidence. Judge Metheny sentenced Deere to\ndeath the same day. The California Supreme Court affirmed.\nDeere II, 808 P.2d at 1195.\n\n    Evidence of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental incompetence in\n1986 falls into two categories. First, three attorneys who\nappeared before him provided affidavits in which they attest\nto Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence in 1986. Second, the\nrecord of Deere\u2019s 1986 resentencing, including but not\nlimited to the transcripts, shows Judge Metheny\u2019s\nincompetence.\n\n                  1. Attorneys\u2019 Affidavits\n\n    Three attorneys who appeared before Judge Metheny in\nthe 1980s provided sworn affidavits in support of Deere\u2019s\n1993 state habeas petition. Those affidavits were later\nprovided to the district court in support of Deere\u2019s federal\nhabeas petition.\n\n   Attorney Mark Sullivan wrote:\n\n          I came to know Judge Fred Metheny in\n       1983 when he presided over a criminal case\n       wherein I represented the defendant. That\n\f68                  DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n     experience left me unwilling to risk the liberty\n     of another of my clients in his hands.

In a civil jury trial in 1984, Ohlsson vs.\n     Phillips, opposing counsel and I found\n     ourselves bewildered by many of Judge\n     Metheny\u2019s strange rulings and off-hand\n     remarks to the jury. For example, despite the\n     fact that my wife and I had never had any\n     personal relationship whatsoever with Judge\n     Metheny, he told jurors in the case that my\n     wife constantly complained to him that I\n     stayed out too late at night. This was out of\n     the blue and not connected to anything that\n     had transpired.\n\n         . . . By 1986, the only matter of mine\n     which I would agree to allow Judge Metheny\n     to hear was McCready vs. Moore, a Superior\n     Court trial de novo of a small claims action.\n     This matter was supposed to last a couple of\n     hours, but we were in our third day of\n     testimony when Judge Metheny appeared to\n     become very frustrated. He stepped down\n     from the bench and started shaking hands with\n     all of the litigants seated at counsel table.\n     Opposing counsel and I just looked at one\n     another in amazement. Judge Metheny then\n     went into the spectator section of the\n     courtroom where many observers had been\n     seated and started shaking hands with them.\n     He told them that he assumed all of the people\n\f                 DEERE V . CULLEN                       69\n\n   in his courtroom were Christians and attended\n   church, and remarked upon our inability to\n   settle the case. He then ordered the case\n   dismissed. Opposing counsel and I reported\n   this to the presiding judge, and Judge Noah\n   Ned Jamin informed us that he would be\n   retrying the case in its entirety, which is what\n   he did.\n\n       . . . As the years passed, it seemed as if his\n   condition worsened considerably. It appeared\n   as if he would float in and out of reality. He\n   would not recognize people whom he had\n   known for years. It was a very sad situation,\n   because I am told that he was once a very\n   likeable man.\n\nAttorney Taylor Huff wrote:\n\n       I have worked in the Indio [public\n   defender\u2019s] office since approximately March\n   of 1985. I appeared before Judge Fred\n   Metheny between five and ten times from\n   1985 until his retirement in 1989, but did not\n   conduct any criminal trials before him. . . .\n\n       I did have occasion to appear before Judge\n   Metheny for pretrial motions. I recall one\n   lengthy suppression hearing which was held\n   in 1985 in the case of People v. Dyer. It\n   became obvious to me during that hearing that\n   the judge had difficulty grasping the legal\n   concepts involved; and his written ruling . . .\n   confirmed my opinion of his slipping grasp.\n\f70                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n            . . . I was aware of the penalty phase\n        retrial ordered by the California Supreme\n        Court in People v. Deere, as Mr. Deere was\n        represented by Glenn Jones, another deputy in\n        the Indio office. I observed part of these\n        proceedings. In my opinion, it was not\n        appropriate for this capital case to be\n        reassigned to Judge Metheny; I do not believe\n        he was then competent to sit in judgment of a\n        capital case or other serious or complex\n        criminal matters.\n\n     Attorney Michael Kennedy wrote:\n\n            I was a deputy district attorney in Indio,\n        Palm Springs, and Blythe in 1983 and 1984\n        and entered private criminal defense practice\n        in those areas in 1985. I had heard of\n        Superior Court Judge Fred Metheny\u2019s\n        reputation among the local prosecution and\n        defense bars as being unable to render\n        appropriate judicial services as long ago as\n        about 1984, while I was still a prosecutor. I\n        specifically recall my supervisor, then-\n        Assistant District Attorney . . . Thomas\n        Douglass, Jr., commenting on his anxiety\n        about having complicated evidentiary issues\n        heard by Judge Metheny in about 1984.\n        However, it was my impression that the\n        D.A.\u2019s office did not want to shunt cases away\n        from Judge Metheny . . . because Judge\n        Metheny\u2019s background as an F.B.I. agent\n        (about which litigants were always regaled at\n\f              DEERE V . CULLEN                       71\n\nlength by the judge) caused him to\ninstinctually err on the side of the People. . . .\n\n    It was not until about 1988 that I had\noccasion to appear before Judge Metheny. . . .\nDuring those proceedings, . . . Judge Metheny\ncame off the bench, following an evidentiary\nobjection by me, assumed a three-point stance\non the floor in the open courtroom, ordered\nme to get down on the floor opposite him (to\nthe horror of the on-looking spectators, court\npersonnel, and my client), and threatened to\nknock me all the way out into the parking lot.\nWhen I declined to \u201cassume the position,\u201d the\njudge then got up and insisted that I\naccompany him to the parking lot so he could\nknock me around. He had, I believe,\nimagined he was back at Nebraska State,\nwhere he was a star football player in the\n\u201940\u2019s or thereabouts. That was one of his\ncommon regressions, witnessed by anyone\nfoolish enough to take a case before him. . . .\n\n     I met with the presiding judge and the\ncriminal calendar judge, who acknowledged\nthe outrageousness of Judge Metheny\u2019s antics,\nand they requested that I not take the matter to\nthe press or to the commission on judicial\nperformance, given that it appeared that Judge\nMetheny would be retiring within several\nweeks. . . . I chastised these two judges for\nletting things get so far out of hand with a\njudge who they, and everyone, knew was not\ncapable of handling the job, to the serious\n\f72                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n       detriment of those whose liberties hang in the\n       balance. They conceded it was a difficult\n       matter to deal with and appeared to regret that\n       things had gone on for so long. It seems that\n       the problem was that Judge Metheny was\n       always on the verge of retirement, for several\n       years, so no one wanted to hurt an otherwise\n       distinguished public servant in the twilight of\n       his career. But those promised, serially\n       impending retirements never materialized. . . .\n\n           . . . In my opinion, based on what I heard\n       and what I experienced, Judge Metheny was\n       not competent to handle any serious criminal\n       matter, much less a capital case, in 1986, nor\n       do I believe that anyone who knew of the\n       events of those days considered him\n       competent for some undefined time before\n       1986.\n\n    In November 1987, The Press-Enterprise, a local\nnewspaper of general circulation, rated judges on the\nRiverside County Superior Court based on a survey of\nlawyers and court staff. Judge Metheny was rated the\n\u201cworst\u201d judge on the Riverside bench by a considerable\nmargin. The paper reported, \u201cHis detractors question his\nintelligence and clarity of thought.\u201d The paper continued:\n\n       \u201cHe is in a complete fog,\u201d wrote one criminal\n       law attorney with six years in Superior Court.\n       \u201cDoesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, can\u2019t make a\n       decision, only wants to talk about World War\n       II and playing football for Nebraska.\u201d\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                     73\n\nOne respondent wrote that Judge Metheny \u201chas simply been\nin the trenches too long\u201d; another stated that Judge Metheny\n\u201cappear[ed] to have little grasp of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n        2. Record in Deere\u2019s 1986 Resentencing\n\n    Judge Metheny\u2019s mental incompetence was painfully\nobvious during Deere\u2019s 1986 resentencing. It may be seen in\nexchanges in the courtroom, and in particular instances of\ninappropriate behavior. I will give examples of both.\n\n    A lengthy exchange took place during the first of the two\npost-remand sentencing hearings, on April 21, 1986. The\nState\u2019s attorney, Robert Dunn, began the hearing by\nintroducing transcripts and exhibits from the 1982 sentencing\nhearing. This evidence, in the State\u2019s view, showed\naggravating circumstances warranting the death penalty.\nAfter submitting the evidence, Dunn said, \u201c[A]nd the people\nwould rest.\u201d Judge Metheny accepted the evidence and\nshortly thereafter stated, \u201cYou haven\u2019t rested yet.\u201d Dunn\nrepeated, \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to rest at this time.\u201d\n\n     Jones then moved for a ruling that the State\u2019s evidence\nwas insufficient to support a finding of aggravation. Jones\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m asking the Court to make a ruling that what Mr.\nDunn has offered you does not justify a finding in\naggravation.\u201d Jones had made the same motion at Deere\u2019s\nfirst sentencing hearing in 1982, and Judge Metheny had\ndenied it. Now, however, Judge Metheny did not understand\nthe motion. He responded:\n\n          I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position right now to\n       grant the motion or deny the motion, either\n       one. I think, assuming arguendo, that all the\n\f74                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n        evidence to be introduced by the District\n        Attorney has been offered. If this were the\n        end of it and this were the last shot, it would\n        be a different position for me to view from\n        than if I allow you to go ahead and produce all\n        the evidence that is available and you feel is\n        necessary and proper and supportive, then\n        there\u2019s an opportunity that comes back again\n        to the prosecution and their right to produce\n        additional evidence.\n\nJones replied, \u201cI don\u2019t disagree if the defendant offers\nevidence, but we haven\u2019t got to that stage yet.\u201d Judge\nMetheny then denied Jones\u2019s motion without prejudice.\n\n     Jones tried again:\n\n             Your Honor, with respect I would ask the\n        Court to articulate the factual findings that\n        permits the Court to come to the decision that\n        there are sufficient aggravating circumstances\n        at this point to justify a finding of aggravating\n        circumstances.\n\nJudge Metheny still did not understand:\n\n            Yes. Well, I think there\u2019s a conflict. If\n        you could say it generally without doing two\n        or three days of research on this matter, which\n        may be necessary, but I hope not. I think\n        we\u2019re still looking at this proposition. I\u2019m\n        looking at the case right now although this is\n        the first time I\u2019ve been through it. I haven\u2019t\n        had an opportunity yet to review all the\n\f              DEERE V . CULLEN                     75\n\nevidence that was dumped in. I think it was\ndumped in for a good reason. It\u2019s in now. It\u2019s\nbeen allowed in. It\u2019s for me to review. The\nevidence as I recall it, and I haven\u2019t \u2014 and I\nhave reviewed my files, what I think is\navailable. I\u2019ve come to the feeling that what\nwe discussed first of all is that here is a\nmatter, a case that had to do with more than\none murder. I think we\u2019re talking about\nmurders at the same time, but there were three\nmurders in this particular case and that would\nbe aggravating if it does apply. I haven\u2019t\nmade up my mind on that because this is a\nnew trial for aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances.\n\n    Another thing to take into consideration is\nmurder involves particularly heinous,\natrocious, and cruel actions. Now, I don\u2019t\nthink that\u2019s going to come in on the evidence\nas far as that\u2019s concerned. It isn\u2019t in yet.\nYou\u2019re asking me to do things ahead of time.\nThat\u2019s just my comment on the side. I really\ndon\u2019t have enough in my mind right now.\n\n...\n\n    There is a possibility that we\u2019ll hear\nevidence to the effect that Mr. Deere was\nthere and waiting, pursuing a victim while\nlying in wait. That\u2019s a possibility. But I don\u2019t\nsee how you can ask me or force me now to\nstate what you want me to state until you\nproduce the evidence. I\u2019ve got to make that\n\f76                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n        decision on evidence. I can\u2019t make it out of\n        the wild blue yonder.\n\n           Do you understand my position, Mr.\n        Jones?\n\n     Jones tried once more:\n\n            Your Honor, in all due respect, I do not.\n        I apologize for saying that, but in the end\n        using an analogy, it\u2019s as if we are in a\n        criminal trial and the People have just rested\n        and the defendant is making a motion for\n        judgment upon insufficiency of evidence. We\n        are now in a penalty trial. The People have\n        rested offering their aggravating evidence.\n        I\u2019m making a motion on that evidence asking\n        the Court to make a finding of fact that their\n        aggravating evidence is insufficient, as a\n        matter of law, to support a finding of\n        aggravating circumstances.\n\nJudge Metheny responded:\n\n             I will. I will do that. But if this were the\n        first time around and all this was put into\n        evidence right now and you asked me to make\n        your ruling right now I\u2019d say, hey look, I\n        haven\u2019t had a chance to go over all this\n        evidence yet. I don\u2019t have a memory,\n        although I guess I am probably quite a bit\n        smarter than most of the judges around here,\n        but I don\u2019t like to brag about it. My memory\n        isn\u2019t that implicit.\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                     77\n\n   Jones suggested a brief recess to review the evidence, and\nJudge Metheny said:\n\n           Say this was the way the case was handled\n       the first time around. I\u2019d say wait a minute.\n       I want to go over every one of these exhibits\n       and go over the transcripts and find out\n       actually what happened. We didn\u2019t have a lot\n       on it. We didn\u2019t have a lot of the transcript\n       except final argument. We spent a bit of time\n       there. If you give me another two hours or so\n       I would feel much more comfortable. I don\u2019t\n       want to make any more mistakes. I want to\n       do it not for myself or for you but for justice.\n       I can\u2019t tell you right now.\n\nJones again suggested a recess. Judge Metheny then recessed\nfor lunch. Upon reconvening, Judge Metheny said:\n\n           I have done what I thought was absolutely\n       necessary and that is to review the evidence\n       and review the file again so that I\u2019m caught\n       up-to-date as to what has happened and what\n       is happening.\n\n           Where were we? A motion?\n\nAfter being reminded, Judge Metheny continued:\n\n           As I look at the situation at this point in\n       time, if I were to balance the evidence which,\n       of course, isn\u2019t the proper thing to do now, I\n       would have to, based on the evidence, deny\n       the motion.\n\f78                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nJones asked again for Judge Metheny to \u201carticulate for the\nrecord what it finds in this case which justif[ies] a finding of\naggravation. That\u2019s been my point all along.\u201d Judge\nMetheny neither gave the requested articulation nor provided\na reason for not doing so.\n\n    After Judge Metheny denied his motion, Jones refused to\nprovide evidence in mitigation. District Attorney Dunn then\nsuggested that Judge Metheny hold Jones in contempt. Dunn\nemphasized to Judge Metheny that he was required to hear\nmitigating evidence before sentencing Deere, and that\nsentencing him without that evidence would be pointless.\nJudge Metheny did not hold Jones in contempt and did\nnothing else to secure the presentation of mitigating evidence.\n\n    The next day, without having heard any mitigating\nevidence, Judge Metheny sentenced Deere to death. After\nsentencing Deere, Judge Metheny informed him that he had\nsixty days to appeal. Jones reminded Judge Metheny that a\ndeath penalty appeal is automatic.\n\n    When Judge Metheny resentenced Deere to death in April\n1986, he did not understand what the California Supreme\nCourt had told him to do. In 1982, Jones had refused to\npresent mitigating evidence, and Judge Metheny had\nsentenced Deere to death. In Deere I, the California Supreme\nCourt reversed and remanded for resentencing, specifically\nholding that a death sentence could not be imposed without\nthe presentation of mitigating evidence. On April 21, 1986,\nJones refused to present mitigating evidence, just as he had\ndone four years earlier. On April 22, Judge Metheny\nsentenced Deere to death without having heard mitigating\nevidence, just as he had done in 1982. That is, Judge\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                       79\n\nMetheny did precisely what the Supreme Court had\nunambiguously told him not to do.\n\n    Judge Metheny also behaved inappropriately during\nDeere\u2019s post-remand resentencing. Two examples illustrate\nthis point.\n\n    First, Judge Metheny decided important issues without\nJones or Deere being present. On May 14, 1986, Judge\nMetheny \u201cstayed\u201d Deere\u2019s April 22 death sentence and\nappointed an investigator to look for mitigating evidence.\nThe minute order indicates that the prosecutor and Jones were\npresent in the courtroom during proceedings leading to the\nentry of the order. The next day, Jones wrote a letter\nrequesting that the minute order be changed to reflect the fact\nthat he had not been present. There may, in fact, have been\nno open courtroom proceedings leading to the minute order.\nDespite extensive effort, no transcript for May 14 has been\nlocated. Judge Metheny may have decided, without notice or\nhearing, to stay Deere\u2019s death sentence and to appoint an\ninvestigator; or he may have held a hearing off the record\nwithout either Jones or Deere being present. Judge Metheny\nheld another hearing a month and a half later, on June 27,\n1986, at which he appointed Jonathan Landau to supervise the\ninvestigation, present mitigation evidence, and act as a friend-\nof-the-court at a new sentencing hearing. Judge Metheny also\nestablished various procedures, withdrew the order of\ncontempt against Jones, and affirmed that Jones would\ncontinue representing Deere. Deere was not present in the\ncourtroom, and there was no waiver of his presence.\n\n   Second, Judge Metheny made direct off-the-record\ncontacts with witnesses. During the June 27 hearing at which\nDeere was not present, Judge Metheny stated, \u201cBut, as I\n\f80                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nunderstand the situation, we have been mighty successful\nwith Mr. Deere\u2019s family. I have contacted them directly and\na number of other people who would be happy to testify the\nway Justice Mosk wants them to testify.\u201d Judge Metheny\nalso appears to have contacted Deere\u2019s father at some point,\nfor Judge Metheny stated during Deere\u2019s second\nresentencing, \u201cI think Mr. Deere\u2019s father talked to him about\nit. I don\u2019t think Mr. Deere knows that I know as much as I do\nabout this case.\u201d\n\n    There is direct evidence that Judge Metheny interviewed\nDeere\u2019s mother and two sisters in chambers off the record at\nthe second penalty retrial. Deere\u2019s mother stated in a\ndeclaration presented to both the state and federal habeas\ncourts:\n\n       Me and my daughters Jeannie and Karen went\n       to the second trial, the penalty trial I think\n       they called it. . . . [W]e talked to the judge in\n       his chambers. I can\u2019t remember if I testified.\n       All I remember was going into the judge\u2019s\n       chambers and him asking us if we thought\n       Ronnie could be rehabilitated.\n\nDeere\u2019s sister Jeannie DeLeon also remembered the incident.\nShe stated in her declaration:\n\n       After we testified, the judge asked us to go\n       into his chambers to talk about Ronnie. He\n       asked us a lot of things about Ronnie, about\n       what kind of life Ronnie would lead if his\n       sentence was overturned.        It was real\n       emotional back there.\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                     81\n\n                 3. Majority\u2019s Response\n\n    The panel majority refuses to recognize the extent and\nstrength of the evidence of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental\nincompetence. According to the majority, the evidence\n\u201creveal[s] no more than eccentricity.\u201d Op. at 6.\n\n    First, the majority focuses on a single sentence in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s Deere II opinion that addresses\nJudge Metheny\u2019s consideration of the evidence. The sentence\nupon which the majority relies is italicized in the block\nquotation that appears below. In the view of the majority,\nthis sentence is the \u201cmost important[]\u201d factor. \u201cThis alone\ncompels the conclusion that Judge Metheny was not\nimpaired[.]\u201d Op. at 62. The majority takes the Court\u2019s\nsentence out of context. The Court was responding to an\nargument that in 1986 Judge Metheny had not been impartial,\nand that the death sentence was therefore a \u201cmockery.\u201d The\nCourt wrote:\n\n       On the contrary, the record indicates that the\n       trial court remained scrupulously fair and\n       objective throughout the proceedings. It\n       carefully weighed and considered both the\n       aggravating and mitigating evidence after\n       they were presented. Indeed, neither defense\n       counsel nor Mr. Landau [who was appointed\n       for the purpose of presenting mitigating\n       evidence] challenged the impartiality of the\n       trial court at any point during the proceedings.\n\nDeere II, 808 P.2d at 1195.\n\f82                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n    As the full passage makes clear, the Court was not ruling\non Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence. Indeed, the issue of\nJudge Metheny\u2019s competence was never raised in the direct\nappeal to the Court. Instead, in the passage just quoted, the\nCourt was ruling on Judge Metheny\u2019s impartiality. District\nJudge Taylor correctly understood the limited scope of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s statement. He wrote:\n\n       [The Court\u2019s] findings were made on claims\n       that \u201cthe record [wa]s \u2018ambiguous\u2019 as to the\n       standards which the trial court applied in\n       determining the penalty, and thus that the\n       sentence is constitutionally unreliable,\u201d and\n       that the resentencing was a \u201cmockery.\u201d\n       [Deere II, 808 P.2d at 1194.] Thus, in terms\n       of a claim of mental incompetency on the part\n       of the trial judge, these factual findings do not\n       preclude relief.\n\n    Second, the majority writes that Judge Metheny was\nsailing in \u201cunchartered waters\u201d when Jones refused to present\nmitigating evidence on April 21, and when Judge Metheny\nsentenced Deere to death the next day. Op. at 58\u201359. The\nmajority writes, \u201c[T]here is simply no evidence \u2014 none \u2014\nthat this ruling was other than legal error committed when the\njudge was confronted with a highly unusual situation.\u201d Id. at\n58. The majority is wrong. The waters were hardly\nuncharted. What happened in April 1986 was a precise repeat\nof what had happened in 1982, and the legal issue in 1986\nwas the precise issue that the California Supreme Court\ndecided in Deere I. The conclusion is inescapable that Judge\nMetheny\u2019s mental disability was so severe in April 1986 that\nhe simply could not understand the Court\u2019s clear holding in\nDeere I.\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      83\n\n    Third, the majority contends that Judge Metheny\u2019s odd\nstatements are merely \u201cout-of-context excerpts.\u201d Id. at 59.\nThe majority has inadvertently put its finger on part of the\nproblem. Many of Judge Metheny\u2019s comments are indeed out\nof context. They are oddly irrelevant comments that come\nout of the blue. More important, the majority fails to take\ninto account Judge Metheny\u2019s in-context remarks. The\nexcerpts from the April 21 hearing, quoted at length above in\norder to provide context, show in excruciating detail the\ndegree to which Judge Metheny was mentally impaired.\n\n    Fourth, the majority belittles the affidavits presented by\nattorneys Huff, Kennedy, and Sullivan. In the view of the\nmajority, attorney Huff\u2019s \u201cdeclaration boils down to his\npersonal opinion.\u201d Op. at 60. Attorney Kennedy\u2019s\n\u201cdeclaration speaks of \u2018rumors.\u2019\u201d Id. Attorney Sullivan\u2019s\n\u201cdeclaration speaks of \u2018strange rulings,\u2019 not otherwise\nidentified\u201d; recounts an \u201cinexplicable statement\u201d without\nproviding a transcript; and recounts an \u201cevent\u201d in 1986 that\n\u201cshows a judge who became exasperated and blew his stack.\u201d\nId. at 60\u201361. I disagree. The affidavits of Huff, Kennedy,\nand Sullivan are serious assessments by serious professionals.\nHuff, Kennedy, and Sullivan practiced before Judge Metheny,\ndirectly observed the behavior they describe, and they knew\nJudge Metheny\u2019s reputation in the courthouse. All of them\nconcluded that Judge Metheny was incompetent. These\nattorneys\u2019 affidavits are not casual, offhand, or unsupported\nevaluations. They are, instead, a terrifying window into\nJudge Metheny\u2019s courtroom.\n\n    Fifth, the majority faults Deere for not providing any\nmedical evaluations of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence\nto serve as a judge in 1986. The majority writes, \u201cDespite\nhaving access to a veritable stable of mental health\n\f84                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nprofessionals who could have reviewed the transcripts \u2014 Dr.\nJones, Dr. Rosenthal, Dr. Favazza, Dr. Stewart \u2014 not one has\nopined that Judge Metheny\u2019s statements are evidence of a\ndisordered mind.\u201d Op. at 60. I do not fault Deere for not\nasking Drs. Jones, Rosenthal, Favazza and Stewart to\nevaluate Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence. They were\nretained for the specific purpose of evaluating Deere\u2019s\ncompetence to plead guilty in 1982.\n\n    Moreover, because attorneys and judges are trained to\nunderstand legal rules and legal reasoning, they are in some\nrespects better able than medical professionals to assess\ncompetence to serve as a judge. The question now before us\nis whether the district court should have allowed an\ninvestigation and evidentiary hearing concerning the mental\ncompetence of Judge Metheny. At some point, it may\nbecome necessary to have the evaluation of a developed\nrecord by medical professionals, but I emphatically do not\nbelieve such an evaluation is required at this stage.\n\nB. Habeas Claims Related to Judge Metheny\u2019s Mental\n                  Competence\n\n     I would reverse two holdings of the district court related\nto Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence. First, I would hold\nthat the district court erred in refusing to grant an evidentiary\nhearing concerning Judge Metheny\u2019s competence. Second,\nI would hold that the district court erred in refusing to grant\nan evidentiary hearing on whether Jones committed IAC by\nfailing to seek recusal of Judge Metheny based on his\nincompetence.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                        85\n\n      1. Evidentiary Hearing on Judge Metheny\u2019s\n                     Competence\n\n    The case law on due process violations resulting from\nmental incompetence of the decisionmaker is sparse but clear.\nThe Supreme Court has stated unequivocally, \u201cThis Court has\nrecognized that a defendant has a right to \u2018a tribunal both\nimpartial and mentally competent to afford a hearing.\u2019\u201d\nTanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 126 (1987) (emphasis\nadded) (quoting Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U.S. 167, 176\n(1912)). In Jordan, the Court held that it would violate due\nprocess if an insane person were permitted to sit on a jury in\na criminal case. Jordan, 225 U.S. at 176. The Court held that\ndue process had not been violated only because the state\ncourt, after an evidentiary hearing, had concluded by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the juror in question was\nsane. Id at 173.\n\n    A federal habeas petitioner in a pre-AEDPA case is\nentitled to an evidentiary hearing if \u201c(1) the petitioner\u2019s\nallegations, if proved, would entitle him to relief, and (2) the\nstate court trier of fact has not, after a full and fair hearing,\nreliably found the relevant facts.\u201d Williams v. Calderon,\n52 F.3d 1465, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting Hendricks v.\nVasquez, 974 F.2d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 1992)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Stankewitz v. Woodford,\n365 F.3d 706, 714 (9th Cir. 2004). It is undisputed that Deere\nrequested an evidentiary hearing on state habeas concerning\nJudge Metheny\u2019s competence and that his request was denied.\nDeere thus satisfied the second criterion, as the district court\ncorrectly held. The disputed question is whether Deere\nsatisfied the first criterion.\n\f86                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n   Deere has alleged that Judge Metheny was so mentally\nimpaired in 1986 that he was incompetent to preside over his\ncapital sentencing. Because Deere waived a jury, Judge\nMetheny himself was required to decide whether Deere\nwould live or die.\n\n    Deere has not only alleged facts that would entitle him to\nhabeas relief. He has also provided substantial evidence in\nsupport of his allegations. The district court nonetheless\ndenied Deere an evidentiary hearing. The district judge\nconcluded, \u201cViewed as a whole, the trial judge\u2019s conduct and\nstatements during the proceedings in 1982 and 1986 do not\nsupport Petitioner\u2019s allegations.\u201d (To be clear, I do not\ncontend that Judge Metheny was incompetent in 1982. I\ncontend only that he was incompetent in 1986.) The district\ncourt did not describe the attorneys\u2019 affidavits, nor any of the\nother evidence in the record, in explaining its conclusion.\nThe district court concluded that Deere was not entitled to a\nhearing because the attorneys involved in the case failed to\nraise the issue of Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence. The court\nwrote that attorneys Jones and Landau \u201cwere in the best\nposition to observe the competency of the trial judge in 1982\nand 1986.\u201d It wrote further, \u201c[A]ppellate counsel and the\nprosecutor also appeared before the trial judge, and neither\nattorney ever made any kind of a record regarding the alleged\nincompetency of the trial judge.\u201d\n\n    Given the evidence in the record, the district court should\nnot have attached controlling importance to the silence of the\nattorneys. Lawyers are loathe to challenge as incompetent the\njudge before whom they are appearing, and before whom they\nmight appear again. In Deere\u2019s case, each of the attorneys\nhad a particular reason not to challenge Judge Metheny. The\ntwo defense attorneys in the trial court were Jones and\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                       87\n\nLandau. Jones was actively trying to help Deere get a death\nsentence, and it was relatively clear that Judge Metheny\nwould impose such a sentence. Landau was not Deere\u2019s\nattorney in the normal sense; he was retained as a friend of\nthe court for the sole purpose of presenting mitigating\nevidence at the second resentencing hearing. Further, the\nprosecutor at trial was following office policy in not objecting\nto Judge Metheny. As recounted by attorney Kennedy in his\naffidavit, the prosecutor\u2019s office had a policy of keeping their\ncases before Judge Metheny, despite his incompetence,\nbecause he \u201cinstinctually err[ed] on the side of the People.\u201d\nFinally, an appellate lawyer, even if he had wanted to raise\nthe issue of Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence, would have\nknown that the issue would be properly raised on collateral\nrather than direct review.\n\n    There was considerable evidence of Judge Metheny\u2019s\nincompetence that the district court declined to describe. I\nhave summarized that evidence above. In my view, that\nevidence, if believed, is enough to support a determination\nthat Judge Metheny was so mentally impaired he could not,\nconsistent with due process, preside over Deere\u2019s\nresentencing in 1986. At a bare minimum, Deere was entitled\non federal habeas corpus to a hearing on his claim that Judge\nMetheny was incompetent in 1986. At such a hearing, Deere\nwould have been allowed to introduce additional evidence of\nJudge Metheny\u2019s incompetence. The State, of course, would\nhave been allowed to introduce its own evidence, if any, and\nto cross-examine any of Deere\u2019s witnesses.\n\n   I realize that Judge Metheny has been dead for many\nyears, and that it will be difficult to determine, more than 25\nyears after the fact, the precise degree of Judge Metheny\u2019s\nmental impairment in 1986. It would have been far\n\f88                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\npreferable to have had an evidentiary hearing in 1993, when\nthe issue was first presented to the state and federal habeas\ncourts. It would also have been preferable in 2003, when we\nremanded to the district court for a hearing concerning\nDeere\u2019s competence, to have remanded at the same time for\na hearing concerning Judge Metheny\u2019s competence. Over my\nobjection, the panel majority declined to add to our 2003\nremand order a direction to conduct such a hearing.\n\n    I also realize that inquiries into the mental competence of\njudges pose difficulties. I am sympathetic to the concerns\nexpressed by my colleague, then-Judge Kozinski, in his\ndissenting opinion in Summerlin v. Stewart, 267 F.3d 926,\n957 (9th Cir. 2001) (Kozinski, J., dissenting), opinion\nwithdrawn, Summerlin v. Stewart, 310 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir.\n2002). In a perfect world, all judges would retire before their\nmental faculties deteriorate to the point where they are no\nlonger competent to perform as judges. In that world, we\nwould not be faced with the difficult problem of forcing, or\nencouraging, our colleagues to retire, or with the equally\ndifficult problem of dealing with cases decided by judges\nwho were, or might have been, incompetent.\n\n    But this is not a perfect world. Some judges stay on too\nlong. They decide cases when they are no longer competent\nto do so. There is credible evidence of mental incompetence\nin the record before us. Deere has not embarked on a fishing\nexpedition in which he hopes to find evidence of\nincompetence. He already has such evidence, a lot of it.\nThere may be more evidence still to be found, but Deere has\nalready presented enough to warrant a hearing.\n\n    I therefore conclude that the district court erred in\nrefusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on whether Judge\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      89\n\nMetheny was mentally competent when he sentenced Deere\nto death in 1986.\n\n 2. IAC for Failing to Seek Recusal of Judge Metheny\n\n     In his state habeas petition, Deere requested an\nevidentiary hearing on whether Jones committed IAC in\nfailing to seek recusal of Judge Metheny. The state court\ndenied the request. The district court on federal habeas also\ndenied Deere\u2019s request for a hearing on Jones\u2019s alleged IAC\nin failing to seek recusal based on Judge Metheny\u2019s\nincompetence.\n\n    To establish IAC, Deere must show (1) that Jones\u2019s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness; and (2) that the performance prejudiced his\ndefense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687\u201388\n(1984). An attorney\u2019s performance is deficient when\n\u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not\nfunctioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the\nSixth Amendment.\u201d Id. There is a strong presumption that\ncounsel\u2019s conduct falls within \u201cthe wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance.\u201d Id. at 689. To establish prejudice,\n\u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at\n694.\n\n    If Jones had successfully moved in 1986 to recuse Judge\nMetheny based on incompetence, Judge Metheny would not\nhave been permitted to resentence Deere. A due process\nviolation based on a valid objection to a sitting judge is\nstructural error such that reversal or vacation of the judge\u2019s\norder or judgment is automatic. Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S.\n\f90                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n510, 535 (1927); Greenway v. Schriro, 653 F.3d 790, 805 (9th\nCir. 2011) (\u201c[W]hen a defendant\u2019s right to have his case tried\nby an impartial judge is compromised, there is structural error\nthat requires automatic reversal.\u201d); see also Caperton v. A.T.\nMassey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 883\u201384 (2009) (in a\ncase of alleged judicial bias, a litigant need not demonstrate\nactual bias, but rather only a sufficient \u201crisk\u201d of bias).\n\n    Deere has presented substantial evidence that Judge\nMetheny was mentally incompetent in 1986 when he\nresentenced Deere to death. Deere had convinced Jones that\nhe wanted to die. Jones and Deere struck a \u201cdeal\u201d whereby\nJones would do almost nothing to avoid the death penalty. I\ndo not believe that such a deal \u2014 even if Deere had been\ncompetent to make it \u2014 permitted Jones, consistent with his\nduties as an attorney, to permit a violation of due process by\nallowing a mentally incompetent judge to decide whether his\nclient should live or die.\n\n    A showing of prejudice under Strickland requires a\nshowing that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that Jones\nwould have succeeded in 1986 if he had moved to recuse\nJudge Metheny on grounds of incompetence. The evidence\nalready in the record is more than sufficient to show that such\na motion by Jones would have been successful. The\naffidavits of Huff, Kennedy, and Sullivan show that Judge\nMetheny was incompetent in 1986, and that his incompetence\nwas widely known. More specifically, Sullivan\u2019s affidavit\nrecounts that he and his opposing counsel went to the\npresiding judge in 1986 when Judge Metheny came down off\nthe bench, shook hands with the spectators, commented on\ntheir Christianity, and dismissed the small civil case in the\nmiddle of trial. The presiding judge, well aware of Judge\nMetheny\u2019s mental state, promptly reassigned the case and\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      91\n\nretried it himself. If the presiding judge was willing in 1986\nto reassign this relatively inconsequential case because of\nJudge Metheny\u2019s incompetence, there can hardly be any\ndoubt that he would have reassigned Deere\u2019s capital case if\nJones had sought recusal.\n\n    I therefore conclude that the district court erred in\nrefusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on whether Jones\ncommitted IAC in failing to seek recusal of Judge Metheny.\n\n            III. Deere\u2019s Competence in 1982\n\n    We remanded in 2003 for an evidentiary hearing on issues\nrelated to Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty in 1982. After\nan extensive hearing, the district court concluded that Jones\ncommitted IAC in failing to challenge Deere\u2019s competence to\nplead guilty.\n\n   I agree with the district court that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had attorney Jones properly investigated,\nDeere would have been found incompetent to plead guilty.\n\n                      A. Background\n\n    Deere was born in 1954. He is of Creek and Seminole\nheritage through his father. Deere was one of eight children\nin a very poor family. Deere\u2019s father was a violent alcoholic\nwho abused his wife and beat his children until they bled.\nDeere\u2019s mother sometimes beat him. The family moved to\nBlythe, California, from Oklahoma so that Deere\u2019s parents\ncould work as farm laborers. During his childhood, Deere\nwas exposed to pesticides and pollutants in the nearby fields\nand in the drinking, irrigation, and swimming water.\n\f92                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n    Deere suffered three or perhaps four episodes of\nconvulsions before he was one year old. He was placed in\nspecial education in the third grade because of attention and\npersonality problems. At age ten, Deere had a full-scale I.Q.\nof 76, which placed him in the sixth percentile. When Deere\nwas ten or eleven years old, he grabbed bare electrical wires\nand remained in contact with the current for several minutes.\nThe shock adversely affected his coordination. Deere began\ncutting himself by age eleven. He began running away from\nhome by age twelve. Deere dropped out of school in the\neighth grade. He was committed to the California Youth\nAuthority at age thirteen or fourteen.\n\n    Deere continued to cut himself in his adulthood, leaving\nlong and deep scars all over his body. Deere repeatedly asked\nAlice Lyon, the mother of his first daughter, to kill him.\nOnce, after he had seriously cut his hand, he asked police\nofficers to let him die. On another occasion, when police\nfound Deere bleeding from six-inch cuts on both arms and a\nsmaller cut on his chest, Deere refused medical attention.\nDeere frequently came to the attention of local police for\nconduct including alcohol-related offenses, disturbing the\npeace, stealing a cow, and possessing a concealed weapon.\n\n     Deere had a tumultuous relationship with Cindy Gleason,\nthe mother of his second daughter. In the six months before\nthe murders, Deere\u2019s self-mutilation increased, and he drank\na fifth of vodka each day. Cindy left Deere in January 1982,\ntaking their baby to her mother\u2019s house. Deere began\nthreatening Cindy and her family, including threatening to\nkill family members if Cindy left him and took the baby away\npermanently.\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                      93\n\n    On January 12, 1982, Deere and Cindy met with social\nworker Virginia Erickson Tiernan. Tiernan noticed a seven-\nor eight-inch cut on Deere\u2019s arm. Deere told Tiernan that if\nhe did not cut himself, he would hurt others. Tiernan was\nconcerned that Deere was mentally ill and suggested that he\ngo to the local mental-health center. An intake worker at the\ncenter diagnosed Deere with marital problems, alcohol abuse,\nand antisocial personality disorder.\n\n    In February 1982, Deere and Cindy briefly reconciled but\nagain separated. Deere\u2019s self-mutilation and substance abuse\nincreased, and he again began threatening Cindy and her\nfamily. In the two weeks before the murders, Cindy and her\nmother called Tiernan two or three times each night. Tiernan\nregularly asked the sheriff, probation department, and police\nfor help, reporting Deere\u2019s threats against Cindy and her\nfamily.\n\n    On February 22, 1982, Cindy called Tiernan twice asking\nfor help. Tiernan advised Cindy to get Deere \u201cinto mental\nhealth\u201d and tried the next day to get Deere placed on a 72-\nhour psychiatric hold. On the advice of the probation\ndepartment, Deere returned to the mental-health center on\nFebruary 25, 1982. The intake worker noticed a cut on\nDeere\u2019s forearm, but noted that there was \u201cno indication\u201d of\nany \u201cdanger to self\u201d and instructed Deere to keep his normal\nappointment for the next week.\n\n    On March 3, 1982, Cindy called the police to ask for help.\nCindy\u2019s mother called the supervising psychologist at the\nmental-health center, who told Cindy\u2019s mother that he could\nnot see Deere unless she and Cindy went through \u201cthe proper\nchannels.\u201d Cindy called the probation department for help\nthe next day, March 4, 1982. The probation department told\n\f94                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nCindy to call the same supervising psychologist. The\nsupervising psychologist told Cindy to set up an appointment.\nOn the afternoon of March 4, Cindy\u2019s former brother-in-law\nDon Davis picked up his two daughters, Cindy\u2019s nieces, for\nvisitation. Witnesses reported seeing Deere that evening at a\nlocal market, drunk or in a daze. That night, Cindy and her\nsister drove to Davis\u2019s trailer and found the bodies of Davis\nand the two girls.\n\n     Five days later, police found Deere in the desert, missing\nhis shirt and a shoe. Deere told the police he had been living\non ditch water and raw birds. He had with him notes he had\naddressed to Cindy and his parents. Police found a .22 rifle\nwith writing scratched into the wood stock: \u201cif you have\ngone to doctor I got end the mean Ronnie I wish I understood\n\u2014 Kathy she help kill them now love her \u2014 Now live with\nit for life \u2014 you killed them to \u2014 Shorty [Cindy] you hurt\nlike me how dose [sic] feel.\u201d\n\n     B. Proceedings Leading to Deere\u2019s Guilty Plea\n\n    On the afternoon of March 9, 1982, after Deere\u2019s arrest\nbut before appointment of defense counsel, Dr. Tommy\nBolger interviewed Deere at the jail. Dr. Bolger had never\nreceived formal psychiatric training. He had received a\ndegree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine in 1957 and had\nbecome a Medical Doctor in 1962 as a result of the California\nReunification Act. Dr. Bolger spent most of his career\nworking in the California state prison system. From 1965 to\n1970, he worked under the classification \u201cPhysician and\nSurgeon II\u201d at Patton State Hospital. He then worked as a\n\u201cChief Medical Officer\u201d at San Quentin prison in 1975 and a\n\u201cPhysician and Surgeon\u201d at Soledad prison from 1975 to\n1977. He received a classification as a \u201cStaff Psychiatrist\u201d at\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      95\n\nSoledad in 1977. He voluntarily resigned from state service\nin 1979 and moved to Blythe, where he worked for Riverside\nCounty as a \u201cmedical and psychiatric consultant.\u201d\n\n    Dr. Bolger spoke with Deere for an hour and five minutes.\nHe prepared a report for the police in which he stated, \u201cHis\nintellectual capacity is adjudged a dull normal,\u201d and\n\u201cJudgement is narrowed and constricted.\u201d Dr. Bolger\nprovided what he called a \u201cdiagnostic impression\u201d: \u201c1) Not\nmentally ill[.] 2) Dependant personality type, with explosive\nfeatures, Alcohol and drugs a factor. 3) Antisocial personality\ntype, with borderline features, not psychotic.\u201d Dr. Bolger\nconcluded:\n\n       Mr. Deere is not mentally ill. He has a severe\n       personality problem. He does understand the\n       nature and [sic] the charges against him and was\n       certainly capable of forming the intent and then\n       carrying out the action. He is capable of\n       cooperating with Counsel in his defense, if he\n       feels it is to his advantage.\n\n    Dr. Bolger had interviewed Deere a year earlier in\nconnection with treatment of Deere\u2019s father for seizures and\nmental health problems linked to alcoholism. At that time,\nDr. Bolger had concluded that statements by Deere were\n\u201cmerely [Deere\u2019s] attempt to blame his problems on someone\nelse.\u201d Dr. Bolger did not disclose in his report to the police\nthat he had previously interviewed and formed an impression\nof Deere. He testified in 1986 that he had had no knowledge\nof Deere before the 1982 jail interview.\n\n   The day after Deere\u2019s jail interview with Dr. Bolger, the\ncourt appointed deputy public defender Glenn Jones to\n\f96                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nrepresent Deere. Deere told Jones that he did not want a trial,\ndid not want a defense, and wanted to be executed. Deere\nrefused to discuss the facts of the case with Jones and insisted\non pleading guilty.\n\n    Deere initially pled not guilty, but later moved to change\nhis plea to guilty. On the recommendation of the prosecutor,\nthe court appointed Dr. Bolger to evaluate Deere\u2019s\ncompetence before taking his guilty plea. The prosecutor\nrepresented to the court that Dr. Bolger was a board-certified\npsychiatrist. Dr. Bolger himself sometimes represented that\nhe was a board-certified psychiatrist, even though he was not.\nIt appears to have been common knowledge in the\ncommunity that Dr. Bolger was not a qualified psychiatrist.\nDr. William Jones, the psychologist that attorney Jones later\nretained to evaluate Deere for mental health defenses,\ntestified in the district court that attorney Jones\n\n       characterized Dr. Bolger as sort of a hack. No\n       one else would go to Blythe, so they used him\n       in that area. It was someone who had no\n       formal psychiatric training whatsoever[.]\n\n    Dr. Bolger interviewed Deere for about an hour and a half\non June 19, 1982, and submitted a short report to the court on\nJune 21. Dr. Bolger wrote that Deere had been given two\nintelligence tests. In his earlier report to the police, Dr.\nBolger had written that Deere\u2019s intellectual capacity was\n\u201cdull normal,\u201d and that he had \u201cnarrowed and constricted\u201d\njudgment. But in the June report to the court, Dr. Bolger\nreported that Deere was intelligent and had good judgment.\nDr. Bolger wrote: \u201cHe is given verbal Wechsler and verbal\nO[fficer] I[ntelligence] T[est] and scores adequately in the\nhigh percentile range.\u201d \u201cJudgement as tested by verbal skills\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      97\n\nin aforementioned verbal testing is excellent. . . . His I.Q.\nwould be adjudged to be in the high range of normal.\u201d There\nis no indication in the record that Dr. Bolger\u2019s earlier report\nto the police was ever submitted to the court. Dr. Bolger did\nnot reveal in his report to the court that he had prepared a\nreport for the police or that he had interviewed and formed an\nimpression of Deere a year earlier. Dr. Bolger concluded in\nhis report to the court that Deere was competent to plead\nguilty.\n\n    On June 25, Deere pled guilty to three counts of murder\nand admitted a special circumstance allegation. At the time\nof Deere\u2019s plea, attorney Jones had requested but had not yet\nreceived a psychological evaluation. Attorney Jones had seen\nthe scars of self-inflicted wounds on Deere\u2019s arms, chest, and\nabdomen. He had recognized signs of possible mental illness\nand had requested funds from the court to retain mental-\nhealth experts. (Jones ultimately spent only $1,696.86 of the\n$5,000 the court awarded for this purpose.) Jones contacted\nDr. William Jones, Ph.D. (no relation), a licenced\npsychologist, and asked him to do a general psychological\nevaluation of Deere.\n\n    Deere initially refused to see Dr. Jones. He agreed to see\nDr. Jones only on the condition that Attorney Jones allow him\nto plead guilty. Dr. Jones interviewed Deere twice. The first\ninterview took place two days before Deere pled guilty. The\nsecond interview took place a week later. The first interview\ntook an hour and a half, followed by two and a half hours of\npsychological testing. The second interview lasted only thirty\nminutes. Dr. Jones testified in the district court that Deere\nrefused to complete the second interview because \u201che was not\nable to deal with the emotions\u201d of discussing the crime or the\ndeath penalty.\n\f98                    DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n    Attorney Jones did not ask Dr. Jones to evaluate Deere\u2019s\ncompetence to plead guilty. Dr. Jones testified in the district\ncourt that it was standard procedure in the profession in 1982\nnot to give an opinion on competence unless asked to do so.\nDr. Jones wrote in his report that Deere frequently cut himself\nto avoid hurting others, \u201chas a very major alcohol abuse\nproblem,\u201d and \u201cha[s] a major drug abuse problem.\u201d He\nreported that Deere\u2019s full-scale I.Q. on the \u201cWechsler Adult\nIntelligence Scale-Revised\u201d tested at the 7th percentile, or\nborderline retarded. Deere\u2019s Wechsler \u201cverbal I.Q.\u201d tested\n\u201cat the 6th percentile, also in the borderline range.\u201d (Recall\nthat Dr. Bolger reported to the court that Deere had scored \u201cin\nthe high percentile range\u201d on this same Wechsler test.) The\ntests showed, further, that Deere had reading recognition at\nabout the sixth grade level, in the fifth percentile of persons\nhis age; spelling at the fourth grade level, in the first\npercentile; and arithmetic at the third grade level, in the fifth\npercentile.\n\n    Dr. Jones diagnosed Deere as having an adjustment\ndisorder with depressed mood, mixed substance abuse\ndisorder, and borderline personality disorder with anti-social\naspects. Dr. Jones wrote that Deere had had a long-standing\ndesire to be killed, and that he pled guilty so that the State\nwould fulfill this desire:\n\n        He feels that suicide cannot be forgiven, but\n        that it is permissible for someone else to kill\n        him. Consequently, he states that he has\n        frequently asked others to kill him and stab\n        him. He has even paid money for this and on\n        one occasion apparently was stabbed.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                        99\n\n        Presently Mr. Deere states that he does not\n        care in the slightest what happens to him. He\n        states that if he is given the death penalty he is\n        willing to accept it and indeed would prefer it\n        to life imprisonment. He thinks this would\n        make him feel better, but he is unclear as to\n        how he would feel better if he were dead.\n\n   Dr. Jones testified at the evidentiary hearing in the district\ncourt that he had been concerned about Deere\u2019s competence,\nand had expressed his concerns orally to attorney Jones:\n\n        I have a recollection that we talked either in\n        person \u2014 I believe in person or on the\n        telephone before I prepared the report. I\n        recall having a \u2014 this conversation sticks in\n        my mind more vividly than anything else\n        about this case. The issue on one hand, my\n        reservations that he was so self-destructive\n        and on [attorney Jones\u2019s] hand the idea . . .\n        that opting for the death penalty was, in fact,\n        a rational thing for Mr. Deere to do at the time\n        and not, in fact, a \u2014 something reflecting\n        incompetence.\n\nWhen asked at the evidentiary hearing if in 1982 he had \u201cfelt\nDeere was incompetent\u201d and had \u201cin essence . . . told\n[attorney Jones] that,\u201d Dr. Jones replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n               C. District Court Proceedings\n\n    The district court conducted extensive proceedings after\nour 2003 remand. The State and Deere both introduced\nevidence concerning Deere\u2019s competence in 1982.\n\f100                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n                  1. The State\u2019s Evidence\n\n    The State\u2019s evidence consisted of Dr. Bolger\u2019s reports and\nthe report and testimony by Dr. Park Dietz. Dr. Bolger had\ndied by the time of the district court hearing, so the State\nrelied on the two reports he prepared in 1982, both of which\nare described above.\n\n    Dr. Dietz is a board-certified psychiatrist, but he has not\ntreated patients since 1988. He testified that he is the \u201chead\u201d\nof two corporations, one of which provides expert psychiatric\ntestimony in criminal cases. This firm employs a substantial\nstaff of experts \u201cfrom various disciplines.\u201d Dr. Dietz\ndescribed the manner in which his firm prepares cases:\n\n       Basically, we seek to obtain all the relevant\n       documents that we can foresee or that the\n       client allows us to know exists. So we\n       typically send a list of documents that we\u2019re\n       requesting. . . . And then depending on the\n       complexity of the case, the quantity of the\n       documents sometimes more than one expert\n       will work on it. On a simple case with a small\n       stack of documents often that will just be one\n       person\u2019s work. But if there are multiple\n       issues, multiple areas of expertise or extensive\n       documents, we\u2019ll often involve additional\n       experts on the case.\n\nDr. Dietz has testified in a number of high-profile criminal\ncases in federal and state court. In somewhere between 80\npercent to 90 percent of the cases, Dr. Dietz has testified for\nthe prosecution.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                     101\n\n    Dr. Dietz did not interview Deere. He testified that his\ndeclaration and his testimony were primarily based on the\nobservations of attorney Jones and to some degree on the\nreports of Dr. Bolger. Dr. Dietz concluded in his declaration,\n\u201cMr. Deere was, in my judgment, competent each time he\nwas examined by the court,\u201d including the occasion on\n\u201c6/25/92 [sic], when Mr. Deere advised the court that it was\nhis wish to change his plea from not guilty to guilty on all\ncounts.\u201d Dr. Dietz testified that Deere\u2019s history and\nsymptoms were \u201cproof\u201d that he had \u201ca borderline personality\ndisorder.\u201d He testified, \u201cMr. Deere\u2019s borderline personality\ndisorder did not in my view make him incompetent to enter\ninto the decisions he did in 1982.\u201d\n\n    Dr. Dietz relied for his diagnosis in substantial part on a\nnumber of statements made by attorney Jones. For example,\nDr. Dietz quoted Jones as saying, \u201cHe knows the\nconsequences of every decision he\u2019s made, as well as the\nconsequences of his criminal acts. . . . They are rational,\nintelligent decisions by a man who realizes what he has done\nand says, \u2018This is the only position I can take to show you\nthat I am still a man and not an animal.\u2019\u201d\n\n   Dr. Dietz also testified that he trusted Dr. Bolger\u2019s\n\u201cobservations\u201d:\n\n       Dr. Bolger\u2019s report contains enough\n       descriptive information of Dr. Bolger\u2019s\n       observations to support the opinion he offers\n       in this report. And judged by the standards of\n       the day, it was an average or above average\n       competency evaluation.\n\f102                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nDr. Dietz admitted that Dr. Bolger had made a mistake in\n\u201cestimating\u201d Deere\u2019s I.Q. He wrote in his declaration:\n\n       Dr. Bolger could be faulted by the standards\n       of the day for estimating Mr. Deere\u2019s IQ as\n       too high (\u201chigh range of normal\u201d) in his report\n       of 6/21/82 and for less than laudatory writing\n       skill.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Dr. Dietz described in his district-court\ntestimony how he thought Dr. Bolger had arrived at his\n\u201cestimate\u201d that Deere\u2019s I.Q. was in the \u201chigh range of\nnormal\u201d:\n\n       Well, what he did was an impressionistic\n       evaluation of intelligence, which was fairly\n       common then and many people still do it\n       which is give an off-the-cuff idea of whether\n       they think someone is above average or below\n       average without any testing of that. And his\n       off-the-cuff finding was wrong.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Deere\u2019s attorney asked Dr. Dietz whether\nDr. Bolger\u2019s mistake in his \u201cestimate\u201d of Deere\u2019s I.Q. was \u201ca\nfatal error in his report that makes his conclusion erroneous?\u201d\nDr. Dietz replied, \u201cNo. The only way it could be is if it\nturned out by objective evidence that Mr. Deere was mentally\nretarded.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\n    Dr. Jones had concluded in 1982 that Deere was\nincompetent to plead guilty because he had long felt a\ncompulsion to seek death, had felt that it wrong for him to kill\nhimself, and had desired to be killed by someone else.\nDeere\u2019s three other professional witnesses agreed with Dr.\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                      103\n\nJones\u2019s conclusion that Deere\u2019s mental illnesses drove his\ncompulsion to die and thus his decision to plead guilty. Dr.\nDietz disagreed with the conclusion that Deere had a\n\u201ccompulsion\u201d to seek death. However, his disagreement was\nbased on a narrow technical definition of \u201ccompulsion\u201d that\nrequires the sufferer of the disorder to be self-aware, such that\nthe sufferer is himself aware that his actions are \u201cexcessive or\nunreasonable.\u201d\n\n    Dr. Dietz made two obvious mistakes in his testimony.\nFirst, Dr. Dietz stated that Dr. Bolger could be forgiven for\nmerely \u201cestimating\u201d Deere\u2019s I.Q. \u201cwithout any testing.\u201d Dr.\nDietz had not been told, or perhaps did not remember, that\nDr. Bolger had not merely \u201cestimated\u201d Deere\u2019s intelligence.\nRather, Dr. Bolger had performed two separate intelligence\ntests. Dr. Bolger had stated in his report to the court: \u201cHe is\ngiven verbal Wechsler and verbal O[fficer] I[ntelligence]\nT[est] and scores adequately in the high percentile range.\u201d\n\n    Second, Dr. Dietz minimized the importance of Dr.\nBolger\u2019s mistaken \u201cestimate\u201d of Deere\u2019s I.Q. on the ground\nthat there was no \u201cobjective evidence\u201d that Deere was\n\u201cmentally retarded.\u201d Dr. Dietz had not been told, or perhaps\ndid not remember, that there was indeed objective evidence\nof mental retardation. Dr. Jones had stated in his report in\n1982 that he had tested Deere\u2019s full-scale and verbal I.Q.s,\nand had found that Deere was borderline retarded.\n\n                    2. Deere\u2019s Evidence\n\n   Deere\u2019s evidence at the district court evidentiary hearing\nconsisted primarily of evaluations by four doctors \u2014 Dr.\nJones, Dr. Fred Rosenthal, Dr. Armando Favazza, and Dr.\nPablo Stewart. Two of the four doctors had personally\n\f104                  DEERE V . CULLEN\n\ninterviewed Deere. All four of them concluded that Deere\nwas not competent to plead guilty in 1982.\n\n   As noted above, Dr. Jones interviewed Deere twice in\n1982, just before and just after Deere pled guilty, and\nprepared a contemporaneous report. Dr. Jones wrote in a\n1993 declaration:\n\n       Mr. Deere . . . had a compulsion to be\n       punished with the death penalty and did not\n       want anyone to interfere with that. Mr.\n       Deere\u2019s insistence on pleading guilty was part\n       of that compulsion and an outgrowth of his\n       mental disturbances; it was irrational. . . . Mr.\n       Deere was extremely self-destructive to begin\n       with and teetered throughout his life on the\n       edge of suicide, as evidenced most\n       dramatically by his history of self-\n       mutilation. . . . In sum, it appeared to me that\n       Mr. Deere was so bent on self-destruction that\n       it disabled him from cooperating in a\n       meaningful way with the presentation of a\n       defense and caused him to solicit the death\n       penalty. . . . Mr. Deere\u2019s personality was one\n       of denial about his inadequacies, and his\n       ability to correctly perceive reality was\n       limited. It would have been naive to take Mr.\n       Deere at face value because he was not\n       thinking logically.\n\nDr. Jones concluded:\n\n       In my opinion, which I hold to a reasonable\n       degree of professional certainty, Mr. Deere\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                     105\n\n       was not competent to aid and assist counsel in\n       the conduct of a defense in a rational manner\n       due to his mental disabilities, which\n       compelled him to seek death. Mr. Deere\n       simply was not able to make logical\n       judgments about his defense; rather, he had a\n       compulsion to be punished with the death\n       penalty and did not want anyone to interfere\n       with that. Mr. Deere\u2019s insistence on pleading\n       guilty was an irrational part of that\n       compulsion and an outgrowth of his mental\n       disturbances.\n\n   Dr. Jones testified in the district court to the same effect\nas his 1993 declaration. He emphasized that Deere had\nwanted someone to kill him long before the murders:\n\n       [Deere] reported that he had asked other\n       people to kill him before. He did not believe\n       in suicide, but he believed it would be okay if\n       someone else killed him. . . . In my view, his\n       wanting the death penalty . . . was just kind of\n       an extreme amount of masochistic behavior\n       and self-destruction, efforts to destroy\n       himself. He was strongly motivated in that\n       direction at that time.\n\nDr. Jones testified further \u201cthat was my conclusion, [in 1982,]\nthat some of his acting out behavior was quite prov[o]cative\ntowards others, and my belief was that he desired . . . to be\nkilled.\u201d Dr. Jones testified that Deere told him that he had\neven paid others to kill him.\n\f106                  DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n   Dr. Rosenthal is a board-certified psychiatrist. He\nexamined Deere twice in December 1992 and prepared a\ndeclaration in early 1993. Dr. Rosenthal concluded that\nDeere was incompetent in 1982. He wrote in his declaration:\n\n           Mr. Deere purported to enter a guilty plea,\n       but arrived at that decision under compulsion\n       and substantial pressure from a person on\n       whom he was extremely dependent. He was\n       held in solitary confinement and made\n       constantly aware of threats against his life by\n       persons inside and outside the jail. He was\n       repeatedly interrogated, including three\n       interviews by his former common-law wife,\n       Cindy Gleason, and he was repeatedly told\n       that he had committed the crimes and\n       deserved to die.\n\n           There is substantial evidence that his\n       thought processes were illogical and disturbed\n       during the period of his incarceration. For\n       example, he continued to write to Cindy\n       Gleason, proclaiming his love for her, despite\n       her repeated insistence that he deserved to die\n       and was less than a man. . . .\n\n           In my professional opinion, which I hold\n       to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\n       Mr. Deere\u2019s multiple mental impairments,\n       exacerbated by pressures from his former\n       girlfriend and the conditions of his\n       confinement, rendered him incompetent to\n       rationally comprehend his trial proceedings or\n       to aid and assist counsel at trial. I concur in\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                     107\n\n       the conclusion of William Jones, Ph.D., who\n       examined Mr. Deere at the time of his plea,\n       and would have advised he was not competent\n       to stand trial.\n\nBecause the State had not been able to examine Deere after\n1982, and because there was concern that it might therefore\nbe unfair to allow testimony about Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s 1992\nexamination of Deere, Dr. Rosenthal did not describe his\ninterviews with Deere in his district-court testimony.\nHowever, Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s 1993 declaration was entered into\nthe district-court record.\n\n    Dr. Armando Favazza is a board-certified psychiatrist.\nHe is an expert on the psychology of people who cut\nthemselves. Dr. Favazza reviewed Deere\u2019s personal history\nand records, noting Deere\u2019s troubled and violent family\nhistory, alcohol abuse, depression, and his \u201cprodigious\u201d self-\nmutilation.     Dr. Favazza concluded that Deere was\nincompetent in 1982 because he possessed a \u201cpathological\nfixed idea that he must be killed.\u201d Dr. Favazza testified that\nDeere\u2019s fixed idea, formulated in early childhood\n\n       remained with him to this very day and is a\n       core, central, pathological idea and is\n       preventing him from cooperating with his\n       counsel. He just wants to die, and he\u2019s in a\n       perfect situation right now because he can\n       have the state kill him, and this is what he\n       wants.\n\n    Dr. Pablo Stewart is a board-certified psychiatrist. He is\nalso an examiner with the American Board of Psychiatry and\nNeurology, which grants board certification for psychiatrists.\n\f108                  DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nDr. Stewart also reviewed Deere\u2019s personal history and\nrecords. He concluded that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\nwas Deere\u2019s primary condition, and that its interaction with\nDeere\u2019s depression, substance abuse, and possible organic\nbrain damage rendered him incompetent. Dr. Stewart\u2019s\nassessment of Deere\u2019s competence matched that of Drs.\nJones, Rosenthal and Favazza. He testified:\n\n       Based on the totality of the record, it is my\n       opinion that [Deere\u2019s] pleading guilty and\n       wishing to be executed was not an\n       independent decision but rather colored by,\n       affected by[,] and was a result of his\n       underlying psychiatric condition.\n\n                3. District Court Decision\n\n    Ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of\nboth deficient performance and prejudice. Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). The State does not\ndispute that Jones performed deficiently. It contends only\nthat there was a lack of prejudice. Prejudice requires that\nthere be a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that counsel\u2019s deficient\nperformance affected the outcome of the case. The Court\nwrote in Strickland, \u201c[W]e believe that a defendant need not\nshow that counsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not\naltered the outcome in the case. . . . The defendant must\nshow that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different. A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome.\u201d Id. at 693\u201394 (emphasis added). See also Kyles\nv. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995); Howard v. Clark,\n608 F.3d 563, 568 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                     109\n\n    The district court held that Deere established IAC by\nJones. Because Dr. Jones was the only qualified professional\nwho had performed a contemporaneous examination, the\ncourt relied most heavily on Dr. Jones\u2019s conclusion. The\ncourt also relied, though less heavily, on the conclusion of Dr.\nRosenthal, who examined Deere in 1992, and on the\nconclusions of Drs. Favazza and Stewart. The district court\ndiscounted Dr. Bolger\u2019s conclusion on the ground that Dr.\nBolger was an unqualified evaluator who lied about his\nqualifications. The court considered Dr. Dietz\u2019s conclusion,\nbut weighed it against the contrary conclusions of Drs. Jones,\nRosenthal, Favazza and Stewart. The court held that there\nwas a reasonable probability that, had attorney Jones\nadequately developed the record in 1982, Deere would have\nbeen found incompetent to plead guilty. The court gave its\nreasons in a careful forty-nine-page order. I agree with the\ndistrict court.\n\n  D. Majority\u2019s Disagreement with the District Court\n\n    The majority disagrees with the district court. Its reasons\nare unconvincing.\n\n    First, the majority relies heavily on Dr. Bolger\u2019s\nconclusion that Deere was competent. It tries mightily to\nmake Dr. Bolger into something other than an unqualified\nimposter, repeatedly referring to Dr. Bolger as a\n\u201cpsychiatrist\u201d and refusing to admit that Dr. Bolger lied when\nhe claimed in sworn testimony that he was board-certified in\npsychiatry. Op. at 4, 8\u20139 and n.1, 49. However, the parties\njointly stipulated in the district court: \u201cDr. Bolger was never\nboard certified, and his educational credentials did not qualify\nhim for board certification.\u201d\n\f110                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\n    Second, the majority contends that Dr. Bolger and Dr.\nJones came to the same conclusions about Deere\u2019s\ncompetence in 1982. Op. at 48\u201349. This is not true. As a\npreliminary matter, I note the obvious: Dr. Bolger\u2019s report\nresponded to the court\u2019s question whether Deere was\ncompetent to plead guilty. Dr. Jones\u2019s 1982 report did not\npurport to answer that question. More fundamentally, Dr.\nBolger\u2019s and Dr. Jones\u2019s conclusions about Deere\u2019s mental\nstate were strikingly different. Indeed, Dr. Bolger wrote two\nreports, whose conclusions are themselves strikingly\ndifferent.\n\n    Dr. Bolger\u2019s report to the police (which may not have\nbeen submitted to the court) contained a \u201cdiagnostic\nimpression\u201d that Deere had, inter alia, an \u201c[a]ntisocial\npersonality type, with borderline features, not psychotic.\u201d It\nassessed Deere as having a \u201cdull normal\u201d \u201cintellectual\ncapacity,\u201d and having \u201cnarrowed and constricted\u201d judgment.\nDr. Bolger\u2019s report to the court described a very different\nmental state. Dr. Bolger stated that Deere had scored \u201cin the\nhigh percentile range\u201d on two I.Q. tests, one of which was the\nWechsler Verbal I.Q. test. Dr. Bolger wrote further,\n\u201cJudgement as tested by verbal skills in aforementioned\nverbal testing is excellent. . . . His I.Q. would be adjudged to\nbe in the high range of normal.\u201d Dr. Bolger concluded: \u201cHe\ndisplays no evidence of psychosis or abnormal thinking and\nof course no mental illness is evident.\u201d\n\n    Dr. Jones provided a single report, based on two\ninterviews and testing. Dr. Jones provided a more extensive\ndiscussion of Deere\u2019s background and family history than\neither of Dr. Bolger\u2019s reports. Unlike Dr. Bolger, who had\nprovided only a \u201cdiagnostic impression\u201d in his first report and\nno \u201cdiagnosis\u201d at all in his second report, Dr. Jones provided\n\f                     DEERE V . CULLEN                     111\n\na formal diagnosis: \u201cAdjustment disorder with depressed\nmood[;] Mixed substance abuse disorder, including abuse of\nalcohol, marijuana, stimulants, a[m]phetamines, etc.[;]\nBorderline personality disorder with anti-social aspects.\u201d\nAlso unlike Dr. Bolger, who had reported in his first report\nthat Deere had above average intelligence, Dr. Jones reported\nthat Deere was borderline retarded.\n\n    Most important, Dr. Jones provided an analysis of Deere\u2019s\nmental state that was entirely lacking from either of Dr.\nBolger\u2019s reports. Dr. Jones described Deere\u2019s long-standing\ndesire to die at someone else\u2019s hand, which had led to his\ndesire to plead guilty. Dr. Jones wrote, \u201cHe feels that suicide\ncannot be forgiven, but that it is permissible for someone else\nto kill him. Consequently, he states that he has frequently\nasked others to kill him and stab him. He has even paid\nmoney for this and on one occasion apparently was stabbed.\u201d\nDr. Jones wrote in the last two sentences of his report:\n\u201cThere are self-destructive inclinations, but they are blocked\nfrom expression in suicide. Some of his acting out behavior\nmay have been an effort to get others to kill him.\u201d\n\n    Third, the majority relies on the observations of Judge\nMetheny, attorney Jones, and the prosecutor. It emphasizes\nthat these people had opportunities to observe Deere, and that\nnone of them concluded that he was incompetent to plead\nguilty. The relevant time period is 1982, so I do not discount\nJudge Metheny\u2019s observations on the ground that he was\nincompetent. But I do note that the opportunities for\nobservation by Judge Metheny and the prosecutor were\nlimited.\n\n    More important, mental illness is often not detectable by\na lay person. Dr. Stewart testified that those who are\n\f112                  DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nmentally ill often \u201cmask\u201d symptoms, and that \u201cpeople in the\ncriminal justice system will go to great lengths to hide the\nseverity of mental illness where, in fact, their behavior is\nincompetent, but it\u2019s not seen that way cause they don\u2019t see\nit as mental illness.\u201d Dr. Stewart testified further that \u201cthe\nfact that the judge, his counsel, bailiffs[,] all these other\npeople thought he was competent, that doesn\u2019t help me one\nway or the other.\u201d Dr. Rosenthal also testified that a\ncompetency determination cannot be based on a layperson\u2019s\nview: \u201cI don\u2019t think the layperson may pick up things that\nsuggest there\u2019s some doubt about competency. It would be\na mistake to rely on the layperson\u2019s judgment to assess\nwhether somebody is competent or not competent.\u201d\n\n    Deere\u2019s professional witnesses cautioned against being\ntaken in by Deere\u2019s apparent rationality. Dr. Rosenthal\ntestified that taking \u201cwhat the client says at face value\u201d\n\n       can be a real trap. Because one of the\n       problems of not understanding much about\n       mental illness and the way it presents is that\n       you can get people telling you things that look\n       very legitimate and reasonable when they\u2019re\n       really not and the person is operating in an\n       entirely different world from the one you\u2019re\n       in.\n\nDr. Favazza agreed. He concluded that Deere tricked\nattorney Jones into believing that his decision was rational.\nDr. Jones testified, \u201cI did not think that you could take Mr.\nDeere at face value. He \u2014 I don\u2019t think he used his rational\nthinking of doing much of anything in his life, but he would\noffer rationalizations after the fact at times.\u201d\n\f                      DEERE V . CULLEN                     113\n\n    Fourth, the majority contends that the facts of the crimes\nand the transcripts of Deere\u2019s guilty plea proceedings show\nthat he was not \u201cout of touch with reality,\u201d and that he\n\u201cactually understood what was going on.\u201d Op. at 50\u201351. The\nmajority misses the point. Drs. Jones, Rosenthal, Favazza,\nand Stewart did not conclude that Deere was incompetent to\nplead guilty based on a disconnection from reality that\nprevented him from understanding what was \u201cgoing on.\u201d\nRather, they concluded that Deere\u2019s mental illnesses drove\nhis strong desire to die at the hand of someone else. This\ndesire long predated his crime, and so strongly compelled him\nto plead guilty that he was prevented from making a rational\nchoice.\n\n    Finally, the majority writes, \u201cEleven years after Deere\npled guilty, habeas counsel came forward with newly-\nobtained opinions to the effect that Deere\u2019s plea was\nmotivated by an irrational desire to be put to death, rendering\nhim incompetent and his plea invalid.\u201d Op. at 50. In\ndisparaging what it calls \u201cthese belated opinions,\u201d the\nmajority ignores Dr. Jones\u2019s report, prepared in 1982. Op. at\n52. Dr. Jones described in his report Deere\u2019s long-standing\ndesire to be killed by someone else, such that seeking the\ndeath penalty would fulfill that desire. Far from being a\n\u201cbelated opinion,\u201d this is a contemporaneous opinion by the\nonly qualified professional who examined Deere in 1982.\n\n    Deere\u2019s three other professional witnesses agreed with Dr.\nJones. All four witnesses testified to the same thing \u2014 that\nDeere suffered from mental impairments producing a\ncompulsion to seek death at the hand of someone else, that a\nplea of guilty followed by execution would satisfy Deere\u2019s\ndeep-seated and irrational need, and that Deere\u2019s compulsion\nprevented him from making a rational choice. In the words\n\f114                   DEERE V . CULLEN\n\nof Dr. Favazza, \u201cHe just wants to die, and he\u2019s in a perfect\nsituation right now because he can have the state kill him, and\nthis is what he wants.\u201d\n\n                         Conclusion\n\n    There is no greater judicial responsibility than deciding\nwhether a person shall live or die at the hands of the state.\nThe majority makes a grievous error in holding that no\nhearing was required on the competence of Judge Metheny to\nsentence Deere to death in 1986. The majority similarly errs\nin holding that no hearing was required as to whether Jones\nwas ineffective in failing to seek to disqualify Judge\nMetheny. Finally, the majority errs in holding that Jones did\nnot commit ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to\ninvestigate Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty in 1982.\n\n   I respectfully but emphatically dissent.\n\f",

FLETCHER.\nOPINION\nSILVERMAN, Circuit Judge:\nRonald Deere threatened to kill everyone in Cindy Gleason\u2019s family if she were ever to break up with him. On March 4, 1982, Deere made good on his threat. Upset that Cindy had left him, Deere shot *1126and killed Cindy\u2019s brother-in-law, Don Davis, and Davis\u2019s two young daughters, ages 7 and 2.\nDeere was arrested a few days later. After having been appointed a lawyer, he expressed his desire to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to plead guilty, even though he knew he could face the death penalty. Before the plea was entered, Deere\u2019s lawyer arranged for him to be examined by two mental health professionals \u2014 a physician with experience in psychiatry, and a psychologist. Both examiners came to remarkably similar conclusions. Both reported that Deere was oriented as to time, place and person. Neither examiner found Deere to suffer from a thought disorder.\nDeere told the psychologist, William Jones, Ph.D., that he would prefer a death sentence to life imprisonment. He also said that the death penalty would make him feel better and help the people he hurt. He said that pleading guilty would protect others who would be spared the ordeal of a trial and that by pleading guilty he would protect his family from further publicity.\nThe physician, Tommy Bolger, M.D., a former staff psychiatrist in the California prison system and elsewhere, opined that Deere did not suffer from mental illness. However, like Dr. Jones, Dr. Bolger diagnosed Deere with severe personality and substance abuse disorders. Bolger concluded that Deere understood the charges against him and was capable of cooperating with counsel if he wanted to.\nDeere\u2019s lawyer spent countless hours with his client leading up to the change of plea. The lawyer attested that Deere was fully aware of the ramifications of his decision and was legally competent to plead guilty. Following a change-of-plea colloquy in which Deere indisputably was lucid, engaged, and evidenced knowledge of his situation, the trial judge accepted Deere\u2019s guilty plea.\nIn Deere\u2019s present habeas case, he argues that his lawyer was ineffective in 1982 for failing to request a full-blown competency hearing. We hold today that even assuming for the sake of argument that his lawyer should have requested a plenary competency hearing \u2014 despite the reports of the two mental health examiners, despite counsel\u2019s own observations of Deere based on his extensive interaction with him, despite the observations of the prosecutor and the judge, despite Deere\u2019s rational reasons for wanting to plead guilty \u2014 Deere nevertheless suffered no prejudice from the lack of a competency hearing because there was no reasonable probability that he would have been found incompetent to plead guilty. As we said in Dennis v. Budge, 378 F.3d 880, 890 (9th Cir.2004), \u201cThe question ... is not whether mental illness substantially affects a decision, but whether a mental disease, disorder or defect substantially affects the prisoner\u2019s capacity to appreciate his options and make a rational choice.\u201d Id. (Emphasis in the original) There is literally no contemporaneous evidence that Deere lacked the capacity to understand his options and to make a rational decision to accept responsibility for what he did. All of the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings that Deere\u2019s guilty plea was knowing, intelligent and competent. Those findings are presumed correct and have not been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. See Evans v. Raines, 800 F.2d 884, 887 (9th Cir.1986).\nIn 1986, after Deere\u2019s case had been remanded by the California Supreme Court for the presentation of mitigating evidence and re-sentencing, Deere once again appeared before Superior Court Judge Fred Metheny. At that time, neither Deere\u2019s own lawyer, nor the lawyer *1127specially appointed as a Mend-of-the-court to present mitigation on Deere\u2019s behalf, nor the prosecutor, nor any reviewing court expressed any concern whatsoever about Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence. Five years later, in reviewing the transcript of Judge Metheny\u2019s statements at the 1986 resentencing, the California Supreme Court said this about Judge Metheny: \u201c[T]he record indicates that the trial court remained scrupulously fair and objective throughout the proceedings. It carefully weighed and considered both the aggravating and mitigating evidence after they were presented.\u201d People v. Deere, 53 Cal.3d 705, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d 1181, 1195 (1991) (in bank). The California Supreme Court affirmed every one of Judge Metheny\u2019s rulings. Despite this, Deere now seeks discovery and an eviden-tiary hearing on his claim that his lawyer was ineffective in 1986 for failing to move to disqualify Judge Metheny due to the judge\u2019s supposed senility.\nWe hold today that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Deere\u2019s request for discovery and a hearing on the issue. First, Deere came forward with no admissible evidence that the judge was mentally impaired in 1986. The most Deere offered were anecdotes recounted by a grand total of three lawyers, anecdotes that are either hearsay, or that do not shed light on Judge Metheny\u2019s mental status in 1986, or that reveal no more than eccentricity as distinguished from dementia. Tellingly, although Deere\u2019s habeas counsel had access to a stable of mental health professionals, counsel furnished nothing \u2014 zero\u2014from any mental health professional opining that any of the stories about Judge Metheny might be indicative of mental impairment or even that they warrant further investigation. Second, there is absolutely nothing to show that any of the supposed incidents involving other lawyers were ever communicated to Deere\u2019s lawyer. Deere\u2019s lawyer can hardly be faulted for failing to act upon gossip that was never passed along to him. Third, the California Supreme Court reviewed Judge Metheny\u2019s handling of the 1986 proceeding, affirmed him in toto, and found that he was scrupulously fair and objective throughout the proceeding, and that he carefully weighed and considered the evidence. This appellate ruling demonstrates two things: First, that Judge Metheny was not impaired in 1986; and second, if the state supreme court had no cause to question Judge Metheny\u2019s mental status, neither did Deere\u2019s counsel.\nI. Background\nCindy Gleason was Deere\u2019s former girlfriend and the mother of his baby daughter. Don Davis was married to Cindy\u2019s sister Kathy. Kathy and Don had two daughters, Michelle and Melissa.\nCindy broke up with Deere around February 26, 1982. Some time on or after March 1, Deere took a .22 caliber single-action Ithaca rifle from the home of an acquaintance, Marc Nelson.\nOn March 2,1982, Deere told Kathy that he was mad at Don for implying that Kathy was involved with Deere. Deere also told Kathy that he was going to do something that would cause her to hate him. But Deere wouldn\u2019t be around for her to hate. Bruce Norton, a friend of Kathy\u2019s, was present during the conversation. After Kathy left, Deere told Norton, \u201cI\u2019m gonna leave town, but I\u2019ve got something to do first.\u201d Deere added that he only thought he\u2019d get a couple of years in prison if he killed a couple of people. Norton testified that Deere did not appear to be intoxicated at the time.\nTwo days later, on March 4, 1982, Deere was seen around town either drunk or in a daze. Deere telephoned Cindy around 3:20 p.m. and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be responsible for what I do today.\u201d Deere *1128then walked to the Davis trailer, broke in and waited for Davis to return. Davis called Cindy around 4:00 p.m. to say that someone had been in his trailer. Cindy asked Davis to call her back and let her know if anything was missing. Davis never called back. Later that evening Cindy and Kathy found the bodies of Davis and the two children in the Davis trailer. They had been shot with a .22 caliber rifle.\nOn March 9, 1982, five days after the murders, police found Deere camping in the desert near Blythe, and arrested him. Deere told the officers, \u201cI was going to call out to you but I was afraid I would be shot.\u201d At Deere\u2019s campsite, police found Nelson\u2019s .22 caliber rifle (later confirmed as the murder weapon), .22 caliber bullets, a glass and some pictures of Cindy taken from the Davis trailer and letters written by Deere to his family. Davis\u2019s pickup truck was found in a ditch adjacent to where Deere was found.\nRiverside Police officers immediately requested that Tommy Bolger, M.D., the consulting psychiatrist for Riverside County, interview Deere at the jail. Dr. Bolger had obtained a Doctor of Osteopathy degree in 1957. However, he was allowed to use the \u201cM.D.\u201d designation pursuant to the California Reunification Act of 1962. Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 2396 (1962); Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 2275 (2012). Dr. Bolger had worked as a surgeon and medical doctor and trained in psychiatry at Patton State Hospital from 1965 through 1970. In 1975, he was hired as Chief Medical Officer at San Quentin. In September of the same year, he transferred to Soledad State Prison, where he served as a staff psychiatrist from 1977 through 1979. When he resigned from Soledad, Dr. Bol-ger moved to Blythe, opened a medical/psychiatric practice and consulted as a psychiatrist for Riverside and San Bernar-dino Counties. Dr. Bolger died in 1987.1\nOn March 9, 1982, the day Deere was arrested, Dr. Bolger interviewed Deere at the police station for a little over an hour. The next day, Dr. Bolger wrote that Deere was cooperative and competent. Deere had acknowledged that he was aware that anything he told Dr. Bolger could be used against him in court.\nDr. Bolger obtained a complete history from Deere during the interview. Deere told Dr. Bolger that he was being held for three counts of murder. He said he had threatened to kill Cindy, his common-law-wife, if she left him. Deere and Cindy had a six-month-old child. Cindy had another daughter from a previous relationship. Deere stated that he knew Don, Kathy, Michelle and Melissa \u201cwell\u201d because Deere, Cindy, their daughter and Cindy\u2019s other daughter had lived with the Davis family until Cindy left Deere. Kathy was divorcing Don. Deere claimed that he loved Melissa and Michelle. The girls were \u201creal sweeties\u201d who had played with his children. Deere stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did this. I hope that if I am convicted that I will get the gas chamber.\u201d\nDeere also told Dr. Bolger he had been in special education classes, did poorly in *1129school and had a history of self-mutilation and alcohol and drug abuse. Deere stated that he cut himself or broke things when he got \u201cenraged.\u201d\nDr. Bolger opined that Deere \u201canswers appropriately.\u201d He is \u201coriented as to place, time and date,\u201d and is not delusional. Dr. Bolger wrote that Deere is not mentally ill, but has \u201ca severe personality problem.\u201d He \u201cdoes understand the nature and the charges against him\u201d and \u201cwas certainly capable of forming the intent and then carrying out the action.\u201d Finally, Dr. Bolger opined that Deere \u201cis capable of cooperating with counsel in his defense, if he feels it is to his advantage.\u201d\nDr. Bolger diagnosed a \u201cDependent personality type, with explosive features, Alcohol and drugs as factor\u201d and an \u201cAntisocial personality type, with borderline features, not psychotic.\u201d\nOn the same day Dr. Bolger provided his report to police, Glenn S. Jones was appointed to defend Deere. Mr. Jones, a Riverside County Public Defender, had been admitted to the bar in 1972. Before representing Deere, Mr. Jones had practiced for 10 years as a criminal defense trial attorney, with eight years as an assistant public defender. Mr. Jones had represented defendants in \u201ca couple of dozen\u201d murder cases, with one prior death penalty case.\nDeere initially pled not guilty. Mr. Jones testified in 1998 that he had repeatedly discussed the case with Deere \u201cdozens of times\u201d for hours at a time. From 1982 through 1986, Deere consistently told Mr. Jones that he intended to plead guilty, waive a jury trial and request the death penalty. Mr. Jones said that Deere consistently gave three reasons for wanting to plead guilty, even if it meant the death penalty. First, Deere was \u201cconcerned about his family and friends, his relationships.\u201d Deere \u201cdid not want anything done what would in any way bring sadness or pain to\u201d his family. He \u201chad done enough, and he wasn\u2019t going to do anymore.\u201d Second, he wanted to show that he had dignity and morality. Third, Deere wanted to take responsibility for his actions because he had committed the crimes and believed in capital punishment.\nMr. Jones would later testify that at the outset of the representation he would not consent to Deere pleading guilty. But \u201cover time,\u201d Mr. Jones concluded that, although Deere was not well-educated, he was \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and \u201cvery articulate.\u201d As a result of their numerous conversations, Mr. Jones had \u201cabsolutely no doubt that Deere was competent.\u201d Mr. Jones stated:\n[Deere\u2019s] discussions with me were always vivid and intelligent, no indication that he did not know what we were doing, with the consequences of what we were doing. He knew exactly what he was charged with and what the proceedings were all about. There were just no hallmarks of incompetency there at all.\nMr. Jones also testified in 1998 that there \u201cwas never a question in [his] mind\u201d that Deere was able to assist with his defense:\nHe had the ability. It was a very reasoned decision he made as to what he wanted to do, which was the reason why he acted the way he did or said what he said or did what he did. Not because he was acting under any delusion or hallucination or fantasy or any kind of psychiatric or psychological, you know, reason for his behavior.\nMr. Jones added that Deere cooperated with his defense by listening to and discussing Mr. Jones\u2019s suggestions, signing releases, never refusing to talk to Mr. Jones, and not interrupting discussions or walking out.\nMr. Jones also stated that he \u201cfound no indication that [Deere\u2019s] desire to plead guilty and obtain the death penalty had *1130anything to do with a death wish or that there was any suicidal impulse behind [Deere\u2019s] desire to plead guilty.\u201d Rather, Deere pled guilty \u201cout of a strong sense of justice he had that he deserved the death penalty; it was a moral statement of principle that I accepted.\u201d \u201cIt was clear\u201d to Mr. Jones that Deere \u201cunderstood every aspect of the proceeding.\u201d Mr. Jones added, \u201cI have dealt with hundreds, thousands of defendants, and [Deere] did not in any way, shape, or form impress me as being incompetent.\u201d\nDeere eventually persuaded Mr. Jones that he wanted to plead guilty, was competent to plead guilty and was prepared to take responsibility for his actions.\nMr. Jones testified in 1998 that he wanted to pursue insanity and diminished capacity mental health defenses in 1982. He obtained funding for mental health experts, intended to hire at least one psychologist and psychiatrist and he hired a psychologist, William Jones, Ph.D. (no relation to Mr. Jones), to evaluate Deere for mental health defenses. Mr. Jones requested Dr. Jones to perform a general mental examination of Deere, but not to assess him for competency. His reason for this was two-fold: first, he did not doubt Deere\u2019s competency; and second, it was his practice to use separate experts for competency questions and mental health defenses.\nMr. Jones and Deere had several discussions about possible mental health defenses. But, Deere consistently refused to \u201cdo anything inconsistent with his ultimate choice,\u201d to accept responsibility for what he had done. Deere convinced Mr. Jones that \u201che would have no part in any kind of mental defense.\u201d\nOn June 18, 1982, Deere moved to change his pleas to guilty. Judge Fred Metheny presided over Deere\u2019s case. Because the Information did not specify the degrees of murder, the parties agreed that the judge would decide the degrees of murder and special circumstances if the guilty plea were accepted. Judge Methe-ny advised Deere that he could be facing the death penalty if he pled guilty. Deere assured the judge that he had discussed his case with Mr. Jones. The prosecutor then suggested that before the court entertain a change of plea, it should appoint a psychiatrist to examine Deere for competence just to make sure that the plea was \u201cproper and just.\u201d The prosecutor recommended Dr. Bolger, who had \u201cpreviously examined\u201d Deere. Mr. Jones agreed to Dr. Bolger\u2019s appointment. Judge Methe-ny then appointed Dr. Bolger to examine Deere.\nDr. Bolger interviewed and tested Deere for an additional hour and a half and provided his second written report dated June 21, 1982. Dr. Bolger found Deere \u201cextremely cooperative and alert.\u201d Deere\u2019s mood was \u201cstable ... neither being depressed nor unduly elated.\u201d Deere denied delusions and hallucinations. Dr. Bolger found \u201cno evidence of organieity.\u201d Dr. Bolger also opined that Deere showed no evidence of psychosis or abnormal thinking and was not mentally ill.\nDr. Bolger further opined that Deere was \u201cable to carry his ideas to goal.\u201d He was \u201cwell aware of the charges\u201d and \u201cimplications of pleading guilty.\u201d Deere had been \u201cwell advised\u201d and was \u201caware of and able to understand the meaning of the waiver of the rights to a jury trial.\u201d He was \u201cable to adequately assist his attorney in the preparation and the presentation of his case.\u201d Finally, Deere was aware of a probability of a death sentence. But, he also knew that a court would decide the sentence. Deere was motivated to having \u201cas short a trial as possible ... since he indicate[d] that either pleading guilty or not guilty would in all probability result in the same decision.\u201d\n*1131At the same time Dr. Bolger was examining Deere, Mr. Jones was pursuing a separate mental health defense examination by Dr. Jones because, even if a guilty plea were accepted, there would still be a trial to determine the degree of murder. Mr. Jones testified in 1998 that, after hours of discussion with Deere, Deere agreed to meet with Dr. Jones. On June 23, 1982, Dr. Jones examined and tested Deere for one and a half hours.\nTwo days later, on June 25, 1982, Deere advised the court that he intended to plead guilty to the three counts of murder. Judge Metheny found that Deere\u2019s appearance, actions, comments and conduct in court had established that Deere understood the charges and was \u201cready, willing and able to cooperate\u201d with defense counsel. Dr. Bolger\u2019s report, Judge Metheny stated, had confirmed the judge\u2019s observations that Deere was competent. Mr. Jones agreed that Deere was competent, stating:\nI have seen no evidence in Mr. Deere that would suggest that he\u2019s in any way incompetent. I\u2019ve reviewed with him the report of Dr. Bolger, and I\u2019d be willing to stipulate at this time the Court may accept the report and base its rulings on the report.\nThe prosecutor \u201cconcur[ed] with Mr. Jones\u2019 evaluation of Mr. Deere\u2019s mental state\u201d and also stipulated that the court could consider Dr. Bolger\u2019s report that Deere was aware of the charges, understood his waiver and was competent.\nThe change of plea transcript establishes that Deere was lucid, clearly understood the proceedings and consulted with counsel when he wanted to. Judge Methe-ny extensively questioned Deere about the rights Deere was waiving, and Deere responded appropriately. When asked to explain his understanding of the right to a jury trial, Deere said, \u201ctwelve people, you know, find out if you\u2019re guilty or not, on the evidence they have.\u201d When asked what the charges were, Deere responded, \u201c[tjhree counts of murder.\u201d Judge Methe-ny then asked Deere, \u201cwhat is your understanding of the nature of that charge?\u201d Deere conferred with Mr. Jones and responded, \u201c[i]ntentional killings with malice.\u201d In response to Judge Metheny\u2019s question of what Deere had done to be charged with murder, Deere stated:\nOn March 4th, 1982, at about 4:00 p.m. I shot, with intent to kill and did kill Don Davis, Melissa, \u2014 I mean Michelle Davis, Melissa Davis. I used a .22 caliber rifle, and the shootings took place at the Davis\u2019 home near Blythe, Riverside County, California. At the time of the shootings, none of the three victims did anything to provoke me in any way.\nWhen asked what sentence he was facing, Deere responded, \u201cdeath or life in prison.\u201d In response to the question regarding what sentence he faced for using the rifle, Deere conferred with counsel and responded, \u201canything less than life, you know, would add two years to any other sentence.\u201d Finally, Judge Metheny asked Deere, \u201cwho do you believe will decide what your sentence will be?\u201d Deere responded, \u201c[t]he judge or the jury.\u201d\nWhen the judge asked Mr. Jones about the possibility of an insanity defense or mental states defense, Mr. Jones responded:\nYour honor, I have spent a great deal of effort and time investigating the possibility of insanity defense or some other mentally related defense. It is my firm conclusion that there is no such defense; and even if there were, Mr. Deere has advised me that he, under no circumstances, will enter a plea of guilty by reason of insanity.\nI find no evidence to support any defense that would reduce these charges to manslaughter.\n*1132Mr. Jones then concurred in the plea and reaffirmed his belief that Deere was competent to enter the plea:\nAs to this particular case, Mr. Deere and I have spent literally hours discussing the case, debating the case, literally arguing about what is appropriate. I think it\u2019s rather obvious that a man\u2019s pleading guilty in a capital case is rare. And when I began this case, I didn\u2019t even consider \u2014 it didn\u2019t even enter my mind that I would consent to such a plea. And Mr. Deere has slowly but surely persuaded me that this is what he wishes to do, that he\u2019s competent to do it, and he\u2019s prepared to take the full responsibility for his actions. And I can find absolutely no basis, in my experience, training or the investigation of this case, which would suggest he should not be permitted to do exactly what he wants to do, knowing the consequences of his act.\nMr. Jones advised the court that Deere had given Mr. Jones three reasons for pleading guilty. First, Deere wanted to take responsibility for his actions and \u201cmaintain[ ] a small amount of dignity as a human being.\u201d Mr. Jones explained, \u201c[h]e knows that doesn\u2019t change what happened. He knows it doesn\u2019t change the agony and the hurt that he\u2019s caused the survivors, but it\u2019s the one thing he can do to show that he can take responsibility.\u201d Second, Deere wanted to protect his family and the victims\u2019 family from a \u201chighly publicized\u201d trial and \u201cmore agony.\u201d Third, Deere knew he would be found guilty, favored capital punishment and was willing to face justice. Mr. Jones explained:\nMr. Deere and I have debated the theory of capital punishment quite a bit. He is in favor of capital punishment, and I am not. He thinks that this case is an appropriate case for capital punishment, and he simply feels that justice should be done in this case, and he feels that pleading guilty and taking what results has justice; whatever happens, happens ... He knows the result of a jury trial. He knows what would happen if the case went to jury trial, and he feels that the expense of a circus or charade of a trial is not right for him or for the community-\nDeere then pled guilty to three open counts of murder2 and admitted to using the gun. Judge Metheny found that the guilty pleas were knowing, voluntary and supported by a factual basis.\nFive days after the change of plea hearing, Deere again met with Dr. Jones for the continuation of the examination Mr. Jones requested in aid of proceedings yet to come to determine the degree of murder and the penalty. Dr. Jones met with and tested Deere for about the same length of time that Dr. Bolger had met with and tested Deere. Dr. Jones\u2019s 1982 findings, conclusions and diagnoses were amazingly similar to Dr. Bolger\u2019s. Dr. Jones opined in 1982 that \u201cDeere was oriented as to time, place, and person\u201d and \u201caware of the charges against him.\u201d He was \u201cgenerally cooperative.\u201d Deere had \u201cno obvious thought disorders in his communication.\u201d His memory was \u201cgenerally adequate.\u201d He denied hallucinations and delusions. Deere\u2019s tests were \u201cwithin normal limits\u201d and did not indicate visual motor or neurological dysfunction. Dr. Jones also opined that Deere cut himself to discharge anger, get attention and sympathy and to manipulate others. Dr. Jones concluded that the self-mutilation was \u201ca very powerful attention-getting device.\u201d\nDeere told Dr. Jones that he cooperated because defense counsel \u201ctold him that lack of cooperation in a psychological evaluation might jeopardize his conviction.\u201d Deere \u201cwished to be found guilty and to *1133accept whatever punishment the court would impose.\u201d Deere also told Dr. Jones that he was \u201cwilling to accept\u201d the death penalty and \u201cindeed would prefer it to life imprisonment.\u201d Deere stated that a death sentence would make him feel better, \u201chelp the people he has hurt,\u201d protect others from participating in trial, protect his family and keep the matter out of the newspapers. Pleading guilty, Dr. Jones opined, was \u201ca further extension of [Deere\u2019s] very strong masochistic tendencies.\u201d\nDr. Jones diagnosed Deere with adjustment disorder with depressed mood; mixed substance abuse disorder, including abuse of alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, amphetamines; and borderline personality disorder with anti-social aspects. In other words, Dr. Jones and Dr. Bolger basically came to the same conclusions. Mr. Jones would later testify that none of the reports, including the reports from Dr. Bol-ger, Dr. Jones and the two private investigators that Mr. Jones hired, gave Mr. Jones any information that would have caused him to question Deere\u2019s competence.\nOn July 23, 1982, the parties returned to court for Judge Metheny to determine the degrees of the three murders. Mr. Jones testified in 1998 that he and Deere had vigorously discussed the issue. Mr. Jones wanted to go for a second degree murder finding. Like all their conversations, it was \u201cgive and take:\u201d\nHe always knew what he wanted, and he was going to get what he wanted to get. And we dealt with each other very civilly on all the vigorous points, so it wasn\u2019t simply him being absolutely uncooperative with me at some point or not. There were always discussions, and eventually when we would do something his way, it was because: \u201cOkay, Ronnie, we\u2019ve discussed this, and its obviously what you want to do, and I can\u2019t see a reason at this point in doing something different.\u201d\nMr. Jones testified that, even though Deere didn\u2019t like his position regarding second degree murder, Deere agreed to let Mr. Jones argue that the crimes were second, not first, degree murder.\nThe parties stipulated that Judge Meth-eny could consider the preliminary hearing testimony to determine the degrees of murder. Again, Deere was alert and engaged. At the prosecutor\u2019s request, Judge Metheny again advised Deere that a first degree murder finding would require a penalty phase and could result in a death sentence. Deere responded appropriately to the judge\u2019s questions and waived his rights.\nWhen Judge Metheny expressed concern that the preliminary hearing testimony might not establish Deere\u2019s state of mind at the time of the crimes, Mr. Jones responded that Deere had given specific instructions not to offer evidence regarding the degrees of murder and asked to continue the discussion in chambers. In chambers, Judge Metheny unsuccessfully tried to convince Deere to allow mental health expert testimony. Judge Metheny explained to Deere that state of mind evidence would help establish first or second degree murder. He suggested that Deere allow Dr. Bolger to testify. Deere responded that he didn\u2019t \u201cagree upon all the doctors.\u201d The judge advised Deere that he would not have to testify, but asked Deere to agree to let the doctors testify.\nHowever, at the next hearing, Mr. Jones advised the court that he would not be offering Dr. Bolger\u2019s testimony because Deere objected to having private family matters discussed in court. Deere confirmed that he agreed with defense counsel.3 The prosecutor declined to present *1134additional evidence and reaffirmed that he believed that Deere was competent, making rational decisions and acting appropriately. Judge Metheny agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s assessment, and again found that Deere was competent and rational.\nThe prosecutor argued for first degree murder because the evidence showed that Deere planned the murder for days and then carried out his plan. Deere shot the girls, he argued, because they were witnesses. Mr. Jones argued for second degree murder, citing evidence that Deere was suffering emotional turmoil and intoxicated. In addition, Mr. Jones argued that the children did not live at the trailer, and there was no way Deere could know the girls would be with their father that afternoon. Thus, premeditation as to them was lacking.\nJudge Metheny then found that the killing of the two children was second degree murder, but that the killing of Don Davis was first degree murder. In a nuanced ruling, the judge reasoned that Deere clearly planned and intended to kill the father, but had not anticipated that the children would be present. Because the evidence regarding the children could be reasonably interpreted as either first or second degree murder, Judge Metheny found Deere guilty of the second degree murder of the children.\nJudge Metheny also found that the multiple murder allegation was true: Deere committed multiple first and second degree murders. This finding made Deere eligible for the death penalty.\nAt the penalty phase hearing, Deere attempted to waive his right to a jury trial. But the prosecutor refused to waive the state\u2019s right. Deere indicated his intention to absent himself. Mr. Jones explained to the court:\nYou know, he wants a death verdict. He said that over and over again. And any procedure that may impede that he just doesn\u2019t want to have any part of, and he sees a jury trial on the penalty phase as possibly resulting in a verdict other than a death penalty. So that\u2019s his line of thinking. It\u2019s very rational, and I don\u2019t see any possible basis for concluding that he\u2019s not competent. His lack of cooperation doesn\u2019t stem from any mental disability. It stems from his very logical decision about what he wants as a result.\nUltimately, the parties agreed to waive a penalty jury. The judge again found Deere competent:\nI think you\u2019re competent to make that decision. I\u2019ve listened to that decision for a number of times now, and I haven\u2019t the slightest doubt that you have the ability and the right to make that decision.\nAt the continued penalty hearing, Deere reaffirmed that he wanted to waive his right to a jury trial at the penalty phase and understood the rights he was waiving. After Mr. Jones and the prosecutor concurred in the waiver, Judge Metheny found Deere\u2019s waiver to be knowing and voluntary.\nAt Deere\u2019s request, Mr. Jones did not present mitigation evidence. Instead, the parties stipulated that Judge Metheny could consider the evidence already admit*1135ted at the degree of murder hearing. Judge Metheny made sure that Deere concurred and understood that he was waiving his right to confront witnesses and found Deere\u2019s waiver to be knowing and voluntary.\nDeere expressed remorse for the crimes and said that he deserved to die. Mr. Jones then commented that Deere\u2019s actions were \u201cunprecedented.\u201d But, Deere had communicated his feelings \u201csteadfastly since practically the first day.\u201d Deere had \u201cslowly but surely swayed\u201d Mr. Jones to permit him to plead guilty, admit the special circumstances, waive jury trials for the guilt and penalty phases and decline to present mitigating evidence. Mr. Jones and Deere had \u201cargued quite vociferously about what to do in this case.\u201d But Deere stated that he didn\u2019t want to cheapen his relationships. He did not deserve mercy and would lose his \u201clast vestige of dignity\u201d if he begged for mercy. The only thing Deere could do to show the victims\u2019 family that he was sorry was to accept full responsibility for his actions.\nMr. Jones advised the court that each decision was made \u201cin close consultation with\u201d Deere, who knew \u201cthe consequences of every decision he\u2019s made, as well as the consequences of his criminal acts.\u201d Mr. Jones added that Deere\u2019s \u201cdecisions are not suicidal, crazy decisions. They are rational, intelligent decisions by a man who realizes what he has done and says, \u2018This is the only position I can take to show you that I am still a man and not an animal.\u2019 \u201d\nJudge Metheny then sentenced Deere to 15 years to life for the murder of each of the children and to death for the first degree murder of their father.\nOn December 31, 1985, the California Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and special circumstance finding, but reversed the death sentence. People v. Deere, 41 Cal.3d 353, 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d 925, 926 (1985).\nDifferent counsel appointed for Deere by the state supreme court for the automatic direct appeal argued that the trial court should have conducted a sua sponte competency hearing because preliminary hearing testimony showed that \u201cshortly before the murders\u201d Deere asked Kathy Davis to kill him, had exhibited suicidal tendencies and had cut himself with a razor blade in the past and \u201cwas frequently intoxicated.\u201d Deere claimed that his guilty plea and waiver of a jury trial amounted to a suicide attempt. Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 927. The California Supreme Court rejected the claim, holding that the record did not show \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of mental incompetence. Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 928. Rather, the trial court and defense counsel believed Deere to be competent. The trial court had appointed the mental health expert, Dr. Bolger, \u201c \u2018to be certain\u2019 of defendant\u2019s ability to stand trial and cooperate with counsel,\u201d even though there was no evidence of incompetence before the court. Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 927-28. The mental health expert found Deere mentally competent to plead guilty. The expert opined that Deere \u201cdisplayed no evidence of psychosis, abnormal thinking or mental illness\u201d and was aware of the charges and the consequences of waiving a jury trial. Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 927.\nThe California Supreme Court also held that neither the decision to plead guilty nor the waiver of a jury trial established incompetence, reasoning that Deere gave rational reasons for pleading guilty and avoiding a jury trial. Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 927-28. He \u201cfelt great remorse for his offenses and was prepared to suffer the consequences of a judgment of death.\u201d Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 927. He also didn\u2019t want a long drawn-out jury trial. He didn\u2019t want \u201cto waste his time listening to trial counsel \u2018yak\u2019 about *1136which prospective jurors were opposed to the death penalty and which were not.\u201d Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 928.\nAlthough the California Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and life sentences, it reversed the death sentence, holding that counsel\u2019s honest, but mistaken, belief that he should not present mitigating evidence because of his client\u2019s wish to present no evidence nevertheless denied Deere effective assistance of counsel. Id., 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 931-34. The case was remanded for a new penalty phase trial.\nIn 1986, Judge Metheny convened the penalty phase trial. Again, Deere was lucid and understood the proceedings. Deere consistently reaffirmed his jury trial waiver and opposition to mitigating evidence.4 Judge Metheny found Deere competent and the waiver knowing:\nTHE COURT: Very well.... The court does find at this time that Mr. Deere \u2014 as he did the last time \u2014 completely understands what we\u2019ve discussed. I\u2019ve never had any doubt about his intelligence and ability to understand. I think he\u2019s made his decision fairly based on the facts we\u2019ve discussed this morning.\nAt the continued hearing, Mr. Jones added:\nI have discussed in detail with Mr. Deere his desires and he\u2019s made them very clear to me. He does not change his position in any matter. He previously waived jury trial and continues to waive jury trial. He wants nothing to do with the jury trial. And I believe he\u2019s satisfied with the way I\u2019ve handled the case. He\u2019s certainly indicated nothing to me that he\u2019s dissatisfied in any way, shape, or form with my performance.\nJudge Metheny then directly addressed Deere to make sure that Deere understood and continued to waive his right to a jury trial:\nTHE COURT: You know originally we went through this before in great *1137detail that you had a right to the jury and you had a right to have the jury decide if you were found guilty of first degree murder. Then the jury would decide according to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. You did waive that. The last time you were in here, just a few weeks ago I asked you again. I don\u2019t mean to be facetious about this. I just want to have this done fairly. And I can assure you, and I want the record to reflect this, that I haven\u2019t made up my mind yet at all.\nI\u2019m going to have to listen to the evidence. I can assure you I\u2019m going to be fair. If I felt otherwise, I would not go any further with this case.\nI\u2019m asking you right now, Mr. Deere, if you want us to pick a jury and go back to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances?\nTHE DEFENDANT: No. I\u2019m satisfied the way it is right now. I don\u2019t want a jury.\nThe prosecution offered only the aggravation evidence presented in the first trial. Despite the fact that the case had been remanded due to ineffective assistance of counsel for Mr. Jones\u2019s failure to set forth mitigating evidence, Mr. Jones again refused to put on any mitigation. Mr. Jones said, \u201c[a]s I indicated during the first trial from day one Ronnie Deere has told me exactly how he wants this case to be handled. He\u2019s never changed once.\u201d Mr. Jones also re-affirmed that Deere was competent and rational:\nHe has convinced me that he knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s not crazy. He\u2019s not incompetent. He\u2019s not insane. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he did to be convicted of these crimes and he knows \u2014 or he believes in his heart that justice should be done.\nMr. Jones repeated that Deere did not want a trial or evidence:\nHe does not want any evidence presented on his behalf because in his heart that is his private life and to bring that evidence into court would violate his relationships with everybody he holds dear and respects in the world. And to him, those relationships are more important than anything else, including his life.\nAlthough the judge threatened Mr. Jones with contempt if he didn\u2019t present mitigation, Mr. Jones reaffirmed that contempt would not change his mind. Mr. Jones again explained that Deere had \u201cslowly but surely convinced\u201d him not to present evidence. He believed Deere had \u201cmade his decisions consciously, temperately, and not in the heat of passion, but based on his true and sincere and honest beliefs about what is right for him.\u201d After Mr. Jones again refused to admit mitigating evidence, Judge Metheny found the Riverside Public Defender\u2019s Office and Mr. Jones in contempt and reinstated the death penalty.\nLess than a month later, Judge Metheny stayed that order and appointed an attorney, Jonathan Landau, as a friend of the court, and an investigator, Richard Welby, to investigate and present mitigating evidence to the court. In addition, the California Supreme Court struck the \u201cstayed\u201d death sentence as \u201chaving been entered through inadvertence.\u201d5 After the state *1138supreme court vacated the death penalty order, Judge Metheny vacated the contempt order.\nAt the continued hearing, now with Mr. Landau present as an amicus, Deere reaffirmed his jury waiver. Mr. Landau discussed the mitigation evidence from the preliminary hearing transcripts, and then presented six mitigation witnesses, including Dr. Bolger. Dr. Bolger opined that Deere suffered from diminished capacity at the time of the murders because he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, stressed and traumatized. Dr. Bolger testified that, although Deere had a hard time expressing his remorse, he was \u201cextremely remorseful over the death of the two children\u201d and \u201cthe influence that this whole thing would have upon his daughter.\u201d Dr. Bolger also believed that Deere could be of benefit to himself and society if spared the death penalty and imprisoned for life instead.\nInvestigator Welby testified about his investigation, adding that he had found that Deere cared about his mother and father and never forgot a birthday or holiday. A neighbor testified that Deere had helped her with yard work. Deere\u2019s sister testified that Deere was upset at the time of the murders because of his deteriorating relationship with Cindy. Deere loved his daughter, had been a protective brother and had never been violent. Deere\u2019s mother testified that she loved her son and wanted him to live. Finally, Mr. Landau introduced a piece of Deere\u2019s art to show the work he could accomplish in prison.\nAfter Mr. Landau argued that life in prison would be more punishment than a death sentence, Deere asked to respond. This is what he said:\nTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019d like to make a statement due to his saying about my being in prison for life. That that would be punishment, you know.\nTHE COURT: A punishment to you?\nTHE DEFENDANT: I understand what he\u2019s saying. I don\u2019t think he really knows much about prison life. He\u2019s going by hearsay. I\u2019m going to state something that I\u2019m pretty sure that if they want to check it out they can check it out with the guards.\nBeing in prison for all your life for the rest of your life \u2014 don\u2019t think I do without the luxuries on the streets. I drink every Friday night, every Saturday night. I smoke my weed everyday. You tell me how being in prison the rest of my life is really a punishment. I see my old lady every week. If I get married then I get contact visits. So he doesn\u2019t really know what punishment is. I go to the yard seven days a week. I sit there if I got a hangover, then I\u2019ll go out.\nHow can he say \u2014 he\u2019s never been there. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. How does that benefit society? I committed a crime punishable by death. I\u2019m not looking at as an eye for an eye. I didn\u2019t write the law. The law stated I committed a crime punishable by death. Not sitting there for the rest of my life which costs taxpayers a lot of money.\nI\u2019m sitting in there doing what I did out here. I smoke weed everyday. You can ask any guards there. They will verify that. Whatever is out there is in here. I make money off my artwork. I make thousands of dollars off my artwork. It doesn\u2019t hurt me a bit to pay the money for drugs or drinking. I live comfortable.\nIf they think that\u2019s punishment, then you go ahead and make your decision from that. I can live a life like that. The rest of my life.\nWhen Judge Metheny responded that he had to \u201cmake a decision based upon the evidence,\u201d Deere added:\n*1139I believe in justice. I believe Kathy has a right to justice. I don\u2019t look at this as an eye for an eye. I don\u2019t think two wrongs make a right. I look at it as the law stated. I committed a crime punishable by death. I should have been punished a long time ago by that law.\nMr. Jones then argued for a life sentence because of the absence of aggravating circumstances and the stress Deere was under at the time of the offenses. Judge Metheny weighed all of the mitigating and aggravating evidence and again sentenced Deere to death.\nOn May 2, 1991, the California Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and death sentence. Deere, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1195. Different appellate counsel, again appointed by the state supreme court for the automatic direct appeal, argued that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate competence in light of the fact that Deere was despondent, had cut himself and was suicidal. Id., 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1186. The California Supreme Court rejected the ineffective assistance claim, reaffirming its prior holding that Deere\u2019s history of cutting of himself with razor blades when his girlfriend threatened to leave and asking Kathy Davis to kill him two days before the murders did not establish that he was incompetent to plead guilty or stand trial. Id. The court said:\n[NJothing at the penalty retrial suggested that the state of defendant\u2019s mental competence had changed for the worse.\nIndeed, the trial court inquired of defendant directly on several occasions whether he wished to waive his right to a jury trial. In each instance, defendant responded clearly and unequivocally that he did. The trial court also observed for the record that defendant appeared to be rational and intelligent.\n\nId.\n\nThe California Supreme Court also affirmed the death sentence, holding that Judge Metheny \u201cproceeded with a careful and detailed analysis of the evidence relevant to the penalty determination, with specific reference to the statutory mitigating and aggravating factors.\u201d Id., 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1190. After listing all of the evidence considered by Judge Metheny, the California Supreme Court held that \u201cthe record leaves no doubt that the court\u2019s sentencing decision was guided by clear and proper standards.\u201d Id.\nDeere filed his first petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court on May 18, 1993, and amended the petition on July 11, 1994, claiming, among other things, that he was incompetent to plead guilty and that Mr. Jones rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to establish his incompetence. In support of these allegations, Deere\u2019s habeas counsel furnished a new report from Dr. Jones and the report of Frank Rosenthal, Ph.D., M.D., a psychiatrist. In a December 1, 1993 affidavit, signed 11 years after the convictions, Dr. Jones opined that:\nMr. Deere was competent in the limited sense of knowing what was going on around him, so that he understood the nature of the criminal proceedings; however, Mr. Deere\u2019s mental disorders rendered him unable to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner. Mr. Deere\u2019s initial refusal to cooperate with my evaluation of him and his eventual failure to complete the testing were themselves indicators of his inability to rationally cooperate in the presentation of a defense. Mr. Deere simply was not able to make logical judgments about his defense, rather, he had a compulsion to be punished with the death penalty and did not want any*1140one to interfere with that. Mr. Deere\u2019s insistence on pleading guilty was part of that compulsion and an outgrowth of his mental disturbances, it was irrational. It did not appear to me that Mr. Deere was capable of making a knowing, voluntary, intelligent decision to so plead.\n\u2021 ^ $\nIn sum, it appeared to me that Mr. Deere was so bent on self-destruction that it disabled him from cooperating in a meaningful way with the presentation of a defense and caused him to solicit the death penalty.\nDeere v. Woodford, 339 F.3d 1084, 1085 (9th Cir.2003) (Deere I). Dr. Jones later testified at his deposition that Deere\u2019s desire to accept responsibility for his crimes \u201cwas probably substantially based on the self-destructive aspect of his personality.\u201d\nHired by habeas counsel, Dr. Rosenthal came on the scene in 1992 and examined and tested Deere 10 years after the conviction. Dr. Rosenthal agreed with Dr. Jones that Deere could not \u201crationally\u201d assist in his defense in 1982 because of his \u201ccompulsion to be punished with the death penalty\u201d and self-destructive personality.6\nThe district court (Judge Gary Taylor) denied Deere\u2019s habeas petition, and did so without holding an evidentiary hearing. The court held that the state trial court\u2019s finding that Deere was competent was presumed correct and was supported by the record. The court reasoned that the attorneys, mental health experts and trial judge all found Deere competent; Dr. Bolger\u2019s 1982 conclusions were consistent with the 1982 report of Dr. Jones; the crimes did not show incompetence; and Deere\u2019s behavior in 1982 and 1986 did not provide any evidence of incompetence. Judge Taylor concluded that there was no evidence before the trial court to require a competence hearing.\nThe district court held that the newly-obtained mental health opinions, made 10 years after trial, could be considered, but that those opinions did not compel the rejection of the finding of Deere\u2019s competence. Both Drs. Jones and Rosenthal based their opinions on what they deemed to be Deere\u2019s unreasonable decision not to put on a defense. However, they agreed that Deere was competent in the sense that he understood the nature of the proceedings. The fact that Deere desired an outcome that the doctors believed to be irrational, Judge Taylor reasoned, did not make Deere incompetent to plead guilty.\nIn his habeas petition, Deere also claimed that he was denied due process because, he said, Judge Metheny was himself not mentally competent in 1986. Deere sought discovery and an evidentiary hearing on this point. The district court denied this claim, reasoning that the record as a whole did not show any evidence that Judge Metheny was incompetent, and none of the attorneys, not Mr. Jones, not Mr. Landau, not the prosecutor, who were in the best position to assess competence, ever moved to recuse the judge. Although Judge Metheny may have made an initial misstep when confronted with Mr. Jones\u2019s refusal to present mitigation after the case had been remanded for exactly that purpose, any error was understandable given the novel nature of the circumstances. This did not show mental incompetence.7\n*1141The district court denied the habeas petition in its entirety and Deere appealed. In 2003, the first time this case was before us, we remanded it for an evidentiary hearing on the question of Deere\u2019s competency to plead guilty and the claims premised on that issue. We wrote that:\n[W]e agree with Deere that he came forward with sufficient evidence at least to trigger a hearing on whether he was, in fact, competent to have pleaded guilty. We do not quarrel with the district court\u2019s statement that Dr. Rosen-thal\u2019s \u201cconclusions cannot be awarded as much weight as that given to Dr. Jones\u2019 examination which occurred around the time of the trial.\u201d Belated opinions of mental health experts are of dubious probative value and therefore, disfavored. See Williams, 306 F.3d at 706. (\u201c[W]e disfavor retrospective determinations of incompetence, and give considerable weight to the lack of contemporaneous evidence of a petitioner\u2019s incompetence to stand trial.\u201d) (citation omitted).\nDr. Jones\u2019s declaration, however, stands on different footing. It is based on his two examinations of Deere, which he performed in 1982, within several days of when Deere pleaded guilty. It is, therefore, probative of Deere\u2019s mental status at the critical time. Dr. Jones also offered a reasonable explanation for why he did not render an opinion on Deere\u2019s competency right then and there: He was told by Lawyer Jones not to. Viewed together, the declarations of Drs. Jones and Rosenthal \u201ccreate a real and substantial doubt\u201d as to Deere\u2019s competency to plead guilty, if they are taken at face value and assumed to be true.\nWe express no opinion on how the district court should weigh the evidence after hearing it. We simply hold that a hearing was required. We remand to the district court with directions to hold a hearing on Deere\u2019s claim that he was incompetent to plead guilty, and to reconsider the petition for writ of habeas corpus as to the claims premised on that contention. This court will rule on the other issues raised in petitioner\u2019s appeal if and when the case is re-appealed.\nDeere, 339 F.3d at 1086-87.\nJudge Snyder took over the case from Judge Taylor and conducted an evidentia-ry hearing in 2007. Deere v. Cullen, 713 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1015 (C.D.Cal.2010).\nAt the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Jones testified that he examined and tested Deere for a total of two hours in 1982. His 1982 diagnosis of borderline personality disorder was supported by Deere\u2019s self-mutilation and suicidal behavior. That same self-destructive behavior motivated Deere to seek the death penalty and waive presentation of mitigating evidence. Dr. Jones opined that Deere \u201c[knew] what was going on around him so that he understood the nature of the criminal proceedings\u201d in 1982. But, Dr. Jones opined, Deere was \u201cunable to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner\u201d in 1982. In other words, Deere was \u201cstrongly motivated\u201d to seek the death penalty by his self-destructive needs.\nDr. Jones testified he \u201chad reservations about\u201d Deere\u2019s competence in 1982 be*1142cause of Deere\u2019s \u201cself-destructive behavior.\u201d But, Dr. Jones did not \u201carrive at ... an opinion with respect to Deere\u2019s competency\u201d in 1982. Dr. Jones testified that he advised Mr. Jones in 1982 that Deere\u2019s decision to plead guilty was a continuation of his impulsive lifestyle. However, Dr. Jones stated in his deposition that he could not remember if he advised Mr. Jones in 1982 that Deere might not be competent.\nArmando Favazza, M.D., testified that habeas counsel hired him in 2004, 22 years after the guilty plea, to assess Deere based on the records. Dr. Favazza never met with or tested Deere, but nevertheless opined at the evidentiary hearing that he would not have diagnosed the borderline personality disorder (the diagnosis made by both Dr. Bolger and Dr. Jones). Instead, he would have diagnosed mild to severe depression. Alcohol abuse, he opined, makes it difficult to diagnose personality disorders. According to Dr. Fa-vazza, Deere had \u201ca pathological fixed idea that he must be killed.\u201d This \u201cfixed idea\u201d \u201cprevented [Deere] from cooperating with his counsel.\u201d Dr. Favazza admitted, though, that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV, commonly known as the DSM IV, does not recognize a mental illness of \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201cpathological\u201d death wish.\nDr. Rosenthal testified that he had been hired to evaluate Dr. Bolger\u2019s qualifications and procedures. Based on Dr. Bol-ger\u2019s two reports, his 1986 testimony and a 1986 deposition, Dr. Rosenthal testified he didn\u2019t think Dr. Bolger had formally trained or was otherwise well-trained in psychiatry. Dr. Rosenthal stated, \u201c[Dr. Bolger] did claim to be board certified in one of his transcripts which I find very troubling because the letter in the files that I was provided from the board, the American Board of Psychiatry indicating that Dr. Bolger had never been certified by that board.\u201d8 Therefore, he did not believe that Dr. Bolger\u2019s report could be reliable.\nDr. Pablo Stewart, a psychiatrist who had never met or tested Deere, was hired by habeas counsel in 2006, 24 years after Deere pled guilty. He opined that Deere suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and possibly organic brain syndrome. Dr. Stewart acknowledged that the same symptoms used to diagnose PTSD can establish a borderline personality disorder. It was unclear, Dr. Stewart testified, whether Deere had a major depressive disorder. Dr. Stewart opined that Deere\u2019s plea was \u201ccolored by\u201d his \u201cpsychiatric condition.\u201d In other words, Deere\u2019s mental health \u201cinhibited\u201d his ability to think rationally.\nThe state\u2019s expert, Park Dietz, M.D., Ph.D., did not meet with or examine Deere, but not because he didn\u2019t try. The parties stipulated, and Judge Snyder ordered, that Dr. Dietz would examine Deere at the prison, but Deere refused to cooperate. Dr. Dietz has been a board-certified psychiatrist since 1979. He specializes in forensic psychiatry. Dr. Dietz agreed with both Drs. Jones and Bolger that Deere had borderline and anti-social personality disorders. The borderline personality disorder diagnosis was supported by Deere\u2019s history of cutting himself; pattern of unstable personal relationship; marked im-pulsivity; frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment; unstable self-image; substance abuse; self-mutilation; emotional instability and inappropriate, intense anger. The anti-social personality disorder was similarly supported by the record. Anti-social personality disorder, which previously would have labeled Deere a sociopath, is not a psychotic state.\nDr. Dietz concluded that the 1982 and 1986 observations of Dr. Jones, defense *1143counsel and Dr. Bolger established that Deere was competent to plead guilty in 1982. Specifically, Dr. Dietz opined:\n[Deere\u2019s] decisions were not made once, without thinking, in an impulsive manner. They were repeatedly and consistently made over a period of time where he heard alternative view points, was educated about his options, had someone making an effort to persuade him to take a different course of action, and during which Mr. Deere himself articulated his reasons for acting as he was wishing. And articulated his personal values and beliefs that were the basis for his decision. That\u2019s not impulsivity and that\u2019s not even the way borderline personalities make their decision when they\u2019re being symptomatic.\nDr. Dietz stated that the \u201cidea of execution or death is undesirable\u201d to most people. But he added:\nIn Mr. Deere\u2019s case, he indicated that he had other values and goals that in his eyes made it self-serving for him to seek and even desire that he be executed. And those included his expressed desire to demonstrate his humanity, his expressed sense of justice, his expressed desire to spare further pain to his family and to his victims\u2019 family. And his expressed desire to accept responsibility for his crimes.\nIf we credit him with the ability to hold those values and to espouse those goals and to care more for living in those ways in the brief span until execution, than for the value of life itself, then we would have to say that in his case he is asserting his goals in the service of himself that to him outweigh the obvious self-destructive function of permitting oneself to be executed.\nDr. Dietz said that \u201cself-harm syndrome\u201d or life-long death wish diagnosis is not a diagnosis recognized by the American Psychiatric Association or listed in the DSM IV. In any case, Dr. Dietz said that the same symptoms support the borderline personality disorder diagnosed by Drs. Jones and Bolger.\nDr. Dietz disagreed with Dr. Jones\u2019s 1993 opinion that Deere had an \u201cirrational compulsion\u201d to seek the death penalty. Dr. Dietz opined that even repeated suicide attempts do not warrant a diagnosis of a \u201ccompulsion\u201d as the term is used in psychiatry. He said that the evidence in this case did not rise to the level of a compulsion.\nAfter the evidentiary hearing, the court found that there was \u201cno conclusive understanding of the nature and degree of [Deere\u2019s] mental illness.\u201d It then offered Deere an opportunity to provide additional evidence to establish that a mental illness prevented him from assisting in his defense. Although the parties agreed that two experts, Drs. Stewart and Dietz, would jointly examine Deere, Deere again refused to cooperate. Therefore, the court ruled without the additional evidence. Deere, 713 F.Supp.2d at 1015-16.\nThe district court granted the habeas petition on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that Mr. Jones had performed below the objective standard of reasonableness in failing to request a full-blown competency hearing before Deere pled guilty. Id. at 1029-30. Further, it also held that Deere was prejudiced by this failing because there was a reasonable probability that he would have been found incompetent had Mr. Jones adequately developed the issue at the time of Deere\u2019s guilty plea. Id. at 1041. Notably, having decided the case on this basis, the court specifically declined to \u201creach Deere\u2019s claim of actual incompetence.\u201d Id.\nIn coming to this conclusion, the court rejected Dr. Bolger\u2019s 1982 opinions, finding that \u201cDr. Bolger had no formal psychi*1144atric training whatsoever,9 misrepresented to the Court that he was board certified, and failed to disclose\u201d that he \u201chad a prior relationship with Deere\u2019s father as his treating physician and had previously interviewed Deere in that capacity.\u201d10 Id. at 1023, 1034. The court gave \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to Dr. Jones\u2019s 1992 opinion, but also considered the expert opinions of Drs. Favazza, Stewart and Dietz. Id. at 1036.\nThe district court vacated Deere\u2019s convictions and sentences, id. at 1043, but stayed the order pending appeal. The state timely appealed.\nII. Jurisdiction and Standards of Review\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s grant or denial of the habeas claims, the ineffective assistance of counsel claims and competence claims de novo. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. Williams v. Wood-ford, 384 F.3d 567, 586, 608 (9th Cir.2004).\nState court findings of fact, including findings made by appellate courts based on reviews of the record, are entitled to a presumption of correctness and are reviewed for clear error. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8) (1996); Sumner v. Mata, 449 U.S. 539, 545-47, 550, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981); Jeffries v. Blodgett, 5 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir.1993).\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act does not apply to this habeas petition because the original petition was filed in 1993. Williams, 384 F.3d at 586. Thus, we grant habeas relief if Deere proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he \u201cis in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (1996).\nIII. Deere\u2019s competence to plea guilty and stand trial and related ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nMany of Deere\u2019s claims revolve around his competence during the 1982 and 1986 proceedings. Deere was competent to plead guilty and stand trial if he had \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and \u201ca rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 396-98, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 172, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975); Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam).11 Competence \u201chas a modest aim: It seeks to ensure that [the defendant] has the capacity to understand the proceedings and to assist counsel.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 402, 113 S.Ct. 2680.\n*1145The state courts\u2019 repeated findings that Deere was competent to plead guilty and stand trial in 1982 and 1986 are presumed to be correct if they are fairly supported by the record. Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U.S. 731, 735, 110 S.Ct. 2223, 109 L.Ed.2d 762 (1990); Maggio v. Fulford, 462 U.S. 111, 116-17, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 76 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (per curiam); Evans, 800 F.2d at 887. No formal evidentiary hearing is required for the presumption to apply. Mata, 449 U.S. at 545-46, 101 S.Ct. 764. Deere must come forward with clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption. Id. at 550, 101 S.Ct. 764.\nThe question on this aspect of the case boils down to this: whether Deere suffered any prejudice from the lack of a competency hearing, even assuming for the sake of argument that Mr. Jones should have moved for one? Put another way, was there a reasonable probability that he would have been found incompetent to plead guilty? Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Stanley v. Cullen, 633 F.3d 852, 862 (9th Cir.2011). We review this question on a de novo basis. Williams, 384 F.3d at 586. After carefully reviewing the record, including the district court\u2019s factual findings that we accept as true, we hold that there is no reasonable probability that Deere would have been found incompetent to enter his plea.\nFurthermore, the state court\u2019s finding that Deere was in fact competent is presumed correct and has not been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Evans, 800 F.2d at 887. First, all of the mental health experts, even the Johnnyeome-latelies, agree that Deere had the ability to understand and actually understood the nature and object of the proceedings against him.12 The reports of both mental health experts who examined Deere in 1982 establish that Deere understood the proceedings and was able to cooperate with counsel. The reports of Drs. Bolger and Jones are remarkable for the similarity of their conclusions. Both doctors opined that Deere understood the proceedings, was oriented to time, place and person and was free of thought disorders. Both experts diagnosed Deere with substance abuse and personality disorders with antisocial aspects. Dr. Jones also diagnosed adjustment disorder. No mental health expert has ever found Deere to be delusional, paranoid or psychotic. Dr. Bolger also opined that Deere was capable of working with counsel if it benefitted him to do so.\nIn 2010, Judge Snyder found that Dr. Bolger, who had died 23 years earlier and was no longer around to defend himself, was not a competent psychiatrist. Never mind that Bolger trained in psychiatry at a state hospital for several years, was the staff psychiatrist at a state prison for several years more and had a private psychiatric practice after that. Even if the court\u2019s finding about Dr. Bolger is entitled to deference, it is of little moment since Bolger\u2019s 1982 opinions were in almost complete lockstep with Dr. Jones\u2019s 1982 opinions and entirely consistent with the observations of the judge and counsel. And those observations come down to this: Deere knew what he was doing and had rational reasons for doing it.\nSecond, Judge Metheny personally interacted with Deere on numerous occasions at every hearing and repeatedly found that Deere understood the proceedings and could cooperate with counsel in a *1146defense. During these interactions, Deere was lucid, appropriately answered open-ended questions, and established his understanding of the proceedings and his ability to consult with counsel. To repeat, the state court\u2019s finding that Deere was competent is not only strongly supported by the evidence, but presumed correct because \u201ccompetency determinations necessarily involve assessments of credibility and demeanor\u201d by the trial judge, and \u201ccompetency may be examined in open court on a full record.\u201d Evans, 800 F.2d at 887. Judge Metheny repeatedly observed and evaluated Deere\u2019s competence in 1982 and 1986. His observation that Deere was competent is presumed correct and strongly supported by the record. Id.; Maggio, 462 U.S. at 117-18, 103 S.Ct. 2261. It certainly has not been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.\nThird, defense counsel, who spent a great deal of time discussing the issues with Deere, had no doubt that Deere was legally competent, rational and could cooperate in his defense if he wanted to. Although\u2019s Deere\u2019s psychiatric diagnosis is a medical question, his competence to plead guilty is a legal one that judges and lawyers deal with all the time. Deere and Mr. Jones conferred for countless hours before the plea was entered. It was apparent to Mr. Jones that Deere understood the proceedings and his various options but wanted to plead guilty for the reasons already stated: he wanted to spare his family; he wanted to minimize the trauma to the survivors; and he thought a guilty plea and possible death sentence was just under the circumstances. These are not irrational considerations. Mr. Jones was uniquely positioned to assess Deere\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings and his legal options. Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437, 450, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992); Williams, 384 F.3d at 606. Thus, Mr. Jones\u2019s opinion is \u201cespecially relevant\u201d and provides \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that Deere was competent. Williams, 384 F.3d at 608.\nFourth, the prosecutor believed that Deere was competent in 1982 and 1986.\nFifth, the facts of the crimes do not suggest legal incompetence or someone out of touch with reality. Deere repeatedly threatened to kill Cindy\u2019s family. Then, after she left him, he planned the murder for a few days, again warned Cindy and then carried out that murder.\nSixth, the transcripts of the guilty plea proceedings establish that Deere actually understood what was going on. Deere accurately answered open-ended questions from the judge, consulted with his counsel in court and demonstrated his understanding of the proceedings, his waivers and the possible results of his actions. He was articulate, repentant and logical in the courtroom. Deere\u2019s \u201ccomprehension of the legal significance\u201d of his actions, including the withdrawal of his not guilty plea, \u201cindicated that he had the ability to consult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d Williams, 384 F.3d at 605.\nFinally, as noted already, Deere had rational reasons for pleading guilty. As the California Supreme Court found, Deere \u201cfelt great remorse for his offenses and was prepared to suffer the consequences of a judgment of death.\u201d Deere, 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 927.\nEleven years after Deere pled guilty, habeas counsel came forward with newly-obtained opinions to the effect that Deere\u2019s plea was motivated by an irrational desire to be put to death, rendering him incompetent and his plea invalid, whether or not he understood his situation and the ramifications of his decision. This evidence is of little consequence for two reasons:\nFirst, as we pointed out in Deere I, \u201c[bjelated opinions of mental health ex*1147perts are of dubious probative value and therefore disfavored.\u201d 339 F.3d at 1086.\nSecond, even if these belated opinions are credited, what matters is not whether Deere had a mental illness that affected his decision, but whether he had a mental illness that affected his capacity to understand his situation and make rational choices. Dennis v. Budge, 378 F.3d 880 (9th Cir.2004), involves a case with strikingly similar facts. Dennis pled guilty to capital murder and was sentenced to death. He sought and was granted leave to withdraw his state habeas appeal. Id. at 882-83. A \u201cnext friend\u201d federal habeas petition was filed arguing that Dennis was incompetent to have made these decisions due to mental illness. Id. at 886-87. A psychiatrist opined that Dennis \u201ckilled the victim and is seeking the death penalty as a convenient way out of life, and a way of assuring himself that ultimately he will die.\u201d Id. at 883. Nevertheless, the psychiatrist opined that Dennis had sufficient understanding of the proceedings to consult with counsel and had a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings. He was fully aware of the charges, the implications of the sentence, and the legal options available to him. Id. We held:\nThe question ... is not whether mental illness substantially affects a decision, but whether a mental disease, disorder or defect substantially affects the prisoner\u2019s capacity to appreciate his options and make a rational choice among them ... A \u201crational choice\u201d does not mean a sensible decision, or a decision that the next friend regards as reasonable.\nId. at 890 (emphasis in original).\nThus, because it is undisputed that Deere was fully aware of his situation and had rational reasons for his desire to plead guilty \u2014 in other words, that he had \u201cthe capacity to appreciate his options and make a rational choice\u201d \u2014 it is not reasonably probable that he would have been found incompetent to plead guilty under the proper legal standard, even if his new-found experts had opined at a competency hearing in 1982 as they do now. We reverse Judge Snyder\u2019s order granting a writ of habeas corpus on this ground.13\nWe now turn to the order issued by Judge Taylor denying habeas relief on the other grounds raised by Deere.\nIV. Trial judge\u2019s mental competency in 1986\nDeere argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing on his claim that counsel was ineffective for not challenging Judge Metheny\u2019s competency to preside at the 1986 *1148penalty retrial. We review the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. Williams, 384 F.3d at 586. The district court must conduct an evidentiary hearing if the facts are disputed, the facts alleged would entitle the petitioner to habeas relief, if true, and if the petitioner did not receive a full and fair opportunity to develop the facts in state court. Id.\nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Deere did not come forward with sufficient evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing on this issue.\nThe essence of Deere\u2019s claim is that in 1986, Judge Metheny was senile and that Mr. Jones rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to attempt to disqualify him. Deere\u2019s habeas counsel admit that they did not have enough proof to sustain this claim, but they argue they came forward with enough to entitle them to discovery and an evidentiary hearing. They offered the following:\n1.After the case was remanded by the California Supreme Court for the presentation of mitigating evidence, and after Mr. Jones still refused at Deere\u2019s insistence to offer mitigation, Judge Metheny held Mr. Jones in contempt and reimposed the death sentence. He then purported to \u201cstay\u201d the sentence and appointed a private investigator to develop mitigation. Mr. Jones objected to this, and ultimately the California Supreme Court struck the order and returned the case to the trial court for the presentation of mitigating evidence.14 When the case went back to Judge Metheny, he appointed Mr. Landau as a friend of the court and mitigation was developed and presented. Deere argues that Judge Metheny\u2019s ruling is evidence of not just legal error, but mental impairment.\n2. Deere also points to certain statements Judge Metheny made at the time of sentencing as indicative of mental impairment. Deere argues that Judge Metheny \u201cemployed bizarre reasoning\u201d by comparing Deere\u2019s murders to mafia hits,15 soldiers shooting enemies during the war and individuals shooting judges.16 The judge also compared Deere to himself, noting that he was angry when he lost a girlfriend during the war.\n3. Deere also furnished declarations from four lawyers. Taylor Huff signed a declaration in 1993. He is a former public defender in Indio. He furnished a copy of a ruling Judge Metheny made in 1985 on a motion to suppress that Huff offered as proof of the judge\u2019s mental impairment. However, there is no explanation of how the ruling evidenced mental impairment or even in what way it was wrong. Huff *1149expressed his opinion that Judge Metheny had difficulty grasping the legal concepts involved in that case, but provided no details. Huff also offered his opinion that Judge Metheny\u2019s faculties seemed to have deteriorated over the years. Huff declared that he had appeared before Judge Metheny five to ten times, but never sought his disqualification.\nMichael Kennedy, a public defender in San Bernardino County, furnished a declaration in 1993 stating that he had heard \u201crumors\u201d as early as 1985 that the judge had Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Kenney states that in 1988 \u2014 two years after Deere was resentenced \u2014 he saw Judge Metheny, a former college football player, come down from the bench after an evidentiary objection, assume a football stance and challenge him. Kennedy speculates that Judge Metheny was having a flashback to his days as a college football player. After Kennedy moved for Judge Metheny\u2019s disqualification, Metheny \u201cappeared to snap back into the present\u201d and apologetically disqualified himself. Kennedy had never appeared before Judge Metheny prior to 1988.\nMark Sullivan declared in 1993 that in 1984 Judge Metheny made \u201cstrange rulings and off-hand remarks\u201d in a civil case. In 1986, Judge Metheny was presiding over a small claims appeal that was only supposed to have taken a couple of hours. When it dragged on for three days, Judge Metheny, apparently exasperated, came down from the bench, said that both sides were good Christian people, that they should settle the dispute, and then he dismissed the case. The matter was reinstated by the presiding judge. Sullivan stated that in his opinion, Judge Metheny was not competent to handle the responsibilities of a judge since 1983.\nFinally, Diane Samuelson, one of Deere\u2019s current habeas counsel, furnished a declaration stating that in 1993 \u2014 seven years after Deere\u2019s sentencing \u2014 she unsuccessfully attempted to contact Judge Metheny. Ultimately, she received a phone call from someone who identified herself as his wife who told Samuelson that the judge was ill, couldn\u2019t remember cases anyway, and had an Alzheimer\u2019s-type condition.\nAs noted above, the district court denied the request for discovery without prejudice,17 balancing this new evidence against the fact that neither Mr. Jones nor Mr. Landau ever moved to recuse and the fact that the California Supreme Court reviewed the record and found that the trial judge was fair, objective and carefully weighed mitigating and aggravating factors at sentencing. Evidence obtained 11 years after the sentencing, the district court reasoned, would not establish the judge\u2019s competency in 1986. Although the request for discovery was denied without prejudice, the request was never renewed.\nThe district court also denied the request for an evidentiary hearing because the evidence proffered, when viewed along with \u201cthe entire record,\u201d did not support Deere\u2019s allegation that the judge was incompetent. None of the attorneys who actually appeared before Judge Metheny in this case \u2014 Mr. Jones, Mr. Landau, the prosecutor and appellate defense counsel\u2014 ever questioned the trial judge\u2019s mental competence. These lawyers, the district court added, were in the best position to observe the trial judge\u2019s behavior. In addition, although Judge Metheny may have initially erred in his handling of Mr. Jones\u2019s refusal to put on mitigation, the district court noted, \u201cthe fact that all the *1150parties were breaking new ground in this case ... It is rare that a defendant pleads guilty in a death penalty case, and Petitioner created a novel dilemma when he declined to present any mitigating evidence.\u201d Neither the judge nor parties had experience with the novel situation.\nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying an eviden-tiary hearing on the subject of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competency in 1986. First, with respect to Judge Metheny\u2019s ruling when Mr. Jones refused to put on mitigation, a ruling later reversed, there is simply no evidence \u2014 none\u2014that this ruling was other than legal error committed when the judge was confronted with a highly unusual situation. Mr. Jones refused to present mitigation in a capital case even after the case had been remanded by the California Supreme Court for that very purpose, even on pain of contempt. Judge Metheny was sailing in un-chartered waters. His procedure of reimposing the death penalty, and then staying it for further mitigation was error. After this error was corrected on appeal, the case was remanded to Judge Metheny and it proceeded to conclusion without further ado and it was affirmed on appeal. Legal error, especially in the context of highly unusual circumstances, is not evidence of senility.\nThe out-of-context excerpts of Judge Metheny\u2019s remarks at Deere\u2019s 1986 sentencing prove only that Judge Metheny was not the most articulate of men. However, when Judge Metheny\u2019s remarks are read in context and not in isolated snippets, it is apparent that he was trying to make the legitimate point that he could empathize with Deere about the pain of being jilted by a girlfriend. He was also explaining that he had to consider the facts of the crimes to determine the sentence. He was making the point that Deere committed an emotional crime, rather than a murder for hire. And that even though Deere was intoxicated and upset, he had nevertheless planned the murder; it was not an accident, like drunk driving, nor was it a spur-of-the-moment killing.18\nAlthough Deere\u2019s lawyers argue that Judge Metheny\u2019s remarks are evidence of mental impairment, conspicuously missing from their submission is anything from any of their doctors. Despite having access to a veritable stable of mental health professionals who could have reviewed the transcripts \u2014 Dr. Jones, Dr. Rosenthal, Dr. Favazza, Dr. Stewart \u2014 not one has opined that Judge Metheny\u2019s statements are evidence of a disordered mind, or even that they warrant further inquiry.\nThe declarations of the lawyers recounting anecdotes also do not provide a basis for a hearing. Taylor Huffs declaration boils down to his personal opinion that Judge Metheny \u201chad difficulty grasping\u201d the legal concepts involved in a 1985 motion to suppress. Huff is certainly entitled to his opinion, but it is not proof of the judge\u2019s mental impairment, especially since there is no specific explanation of what the problem supposedly was. Judge Metheny\u2019s ruling attached to Huffs declaration is unremarkable on its face, and there is not even an allegation that it was *1151ever found to be legally erroneous. Huffs declaration does not warrant a hearing.\nMichael Kennedy\u2019s declaration speaks of \u201crumors\u201d he\u2019d heard about Judge Metheny around 1985. Rumors do not warrant a hearing. The football incident occurred in 1988 \u2014 two years after Deere\u2019s sentencing. At best, the football incident sheds light on Judge Metheny\u2019s status at that time, not in 1986. In fact, Kennedy says he never even appeared before Judge Metheny until 1988. His observations two years after the time in question do not warrant a hearing.\nMark Sullivan\u2019s declaration speaks of \u201cstrange rulings,\u201d not otherwise identified, made by Judge Metheny in a civil case in 1984. It also recounts an inexplicable statement that the judge made to the jury to the effect that Sullivan\u2019s wife had complained to the judge about Sullivan\u2019s staying out too late at night. No transcript was furnished, so it is impossible to tell whether this statement was an attempt at humor, the product of confusion, or something else. In any event, this one stray remark, without any context in a 1984 trial, does not warrant a hearing. The 1986 event in which the judge abruptly dismissed a small claims appeal that was supposed to have taken just a few hours, but went on for three days, shows a judge who became exasperated and blew his stack. Although this is evidence of impatience, it is not hard to understand how or why the incident happened. Once again, Deere has failed to furnish anything from any of his several mental health experts ascribing any clinical significance to this incident.\nThe substance of Diana Samuelson\u2019s declaration quoting the woman who identified herself as Judge Metheny\u2019s wife in 1993 is hearsay. Even if it weren\u2019t, the woman\u2019s statements speak only to Judge Metheny\u2019s condition in February 1993, and say nothing about his status in 1986.\nDeere\u2019s habeas counsel accuse Mr. Jones of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to move to disqualify Judge Metheny, yet offer no evidence whatsoever that Huff, Kennedy or Sullivan ever shared their opinions of Judge Metheny with Mr. Jones or passed along the gossip and rumors they included in their declarations. In evaluating Mr. Jones, we look to what he knew in 1986. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.\nFinally, and most importantly, on May 2, 1991, the California Supreme Court affirmed, without dissent, Judge Metheny\u2019s handling of the 1986 proceeding \u2014 the proceeding Deere now argues was affected by the judge\u2019s mental impairments. Not only was Judge Metheny affirmed in toto, but the Supreme Court even specifically observed that \u201cthe record indicates that the trial court remained scrupulously fair and objective throughout the proceedings. It carefully weighed and considered both the aggravating and mitigating evidence after they were presented.\u201d Deere, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1195. Not only did the Supreme Court fail to express any concern over Judge Metheny\u2019s statements or behavior, it explicitly commended him on the way he handled the case. This alone compels the conclusion that Judge Metheny was not impaired when he presided over this case in 1986, and that Mr. Jones was not ineffective in failing to seek his disqualification.\nThe dissent says, \u201cThe majority holds that a judge suffering from dementia may sentence a man to death.\u201d We hold no such thing. What we really hold is that the anecdotes drummed up many years after the time in question do not support the claim that Judge Metheny was impaired in 1986, particularly in light of the California Supreme Court\u2019s laudatory af-firmance of Judge Metheny\u2019s supposedly-impaired 1986 rulings.\n*1152V. Conclusion\nWe REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of the petition for writ of habeas corpus on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim relating to the lack of a competency hearing, AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of the petition on all other grounds19 and REMAND for the district court to deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus.\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\n\n. In 1986, Bolger testified in this case that he was board-certified in psychiatry and internal medicine. In 1987, he testified in a different case that he was not board-certified in any speciality. It is possible, of course, that Bol-ger intentionally lied in 1986. It is also possible that there was a transcription error or some other explanation for a statement that is so easily refuted. What is puzzling about this is the absence of any evidence in the record that Bolger, in a career that spanned 30 years, ever misrepresented his credentials in a job application, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, or testimony on any other occasion. In March, 2007, 20 years after Bolger died, the parties stipulated that Bolger was never board-certified, but the explanation for his 1986 statement \u2014 a deliberate falsehood or something else^ \u2014 remains a mystery.\n\n\n. The degrees of murder were left for the judge to decide in a subsequent proceeding.\n\n\n. MR. JONES: Your Honor, at this time we will not offer any evidence on the issue of degree. I've discussed the matter with Mr. *1134Deere, and it is his specific instructions that we not call Dr. Bolger. His reasons are personal. He knows that Dr. Bolger would be revealing conversations he\u2019s had with him, which he feels are private. And Dr. Bolger will be discussing family matters, Ronnie's childhood and his brothers and sisters and that sort of thing, and he\u2019s instructed me we are not to call Dr. Bolger as a witness; and so at this time we would not offer any evidence.\nTHE COURT: I take it that\u2019s what you want to do, Mr. Deere; is that right?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n\n\n. THE COURT: I assume, Mr. Deere, that you are willing and want to have Mr. Jones represent you\u2014\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\nTHE COURT: \u2014 from here on out again? THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\nTHE COURT: And do you understand what I told you about the Supreme Court's ruling to the effect that we have to continue with the trial?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, I have read the report. I have one, too. I read it all. THE COURT: I don\u2019t really believe we\u2019re ready to go to trial today; do you, gentlemen?\nMR. JONES: No, that\u2019s correct, Your Hon- or ... I\u2019ve discussed with Mr. Deere his desires, in terms of whether he wants a jury trial or a court trial. He clearly advised me he does not want a jury trial. His previous waiver of jury is still his desire.\nTHE COURT: Of course, you understand you have the right to have a jury trial, if you wish to have it.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n* * *\nTHE COURT: ... [The trial] will be limited to the mitigating and aggravating circumstances. You know what that means. I'm sure of that.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\nTHE COURT: And you have a right \u2014 and your attorney, Mr. Jones, will get this set up \u2014 you will have a right to put on the individuals who will testify for you as to mitigating circumstances. I will be the judge and the finder of fact on this particular question and issue as to whether the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\nThat puts us in a position where the court has the responsibility to determine whether or not the sentence would be life imprisonment or whether it would be the death penalty, or there\u2019s a possibility that there could be some other conclusion.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Do you understand that?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Do you have any questions?\nTHE DEFENDANT: No.\n\n\n. A \"Commitment Judgment of Death\u201d was filed by the Clerk of Court on April 22, 1986. On May 14, 1986, Judge Metheny stayed the sentence to obtain mitigating evidence and scheduled a penalty hearing for June 27, 1986. In a May 19, 1986 minute order, Judge Metheny appointed Richard Welby, a licensed private investigator, to investigate for mitigating evidence. Citing the May 19 order, the California Supreme Court subsequently concluded that the April 22 judgment was \"through inadvertence, prematurely filed.\u201d It ordered the judgment stricken and returned the case to the trial court.\n\n\n. Dr. Rosenthal did not testify about this 1993 report at the evidentiary hearing before Judge Snyder because he could not remember it. Dr. Rosenthal also testified that he could not \u201canswer the question of whether Mr. Deere was competent.\u201d\n\n\n. The district court also rejected a sufficiency of the evidence claim for the first degree murder conviction and related ineffective assistance of counsel claim because Deere:\nwalked a great distance with the murder weapon, broke into the house to wait for Donald Davis to return, had considered the *1141consequences for the homicide on a prior occasion, had threatened to kill the whole family, and had told others that he was going to do something....\nSimilarly, the district court held that counsel was not ineffective for not presenting mental state evidence because Deere was competent, adamantly opposed the evidence, refused to consider a plea of guilty by reason of insanity or mental health defenses and insisted on pleading guilty and seeking the death penalty against defense counsel\u2019s advice. As Mr. Jones advised the court, he had an ethical duty to follow Deere\u2019s wishes.\n\n\n. See Note 1, supra.\n\n\n. This finding is dubious because it is based on Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s speculation about Dr. Bol-ger's training. The record simply does not contain details about the training beyond the fact that he trained and then was officially designated a psychiatrist in the California prison system.\n\n\n. Specifically, Dr. Bolger had treated Deere's father for seizures at the Blythe hospital in 1981 and had taken a family history about the father\u2019s alcoholism from Deere. Dr. Bolger's prior experience with the Deeres is not mentioned in his 1982 reports. In 1986, Bolger denied knowing Deere previously, but is not clear why Dr. Bolger should have been expected to remember in 1986 that he had met Deere five years earlier, before the events of this case, while treating his father.\n\n\n.When Deere pled guilty in 1982, California applied the same competence standard. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1367 (1982); Deere, 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 927; People v. Jablonski, 37 Cal.4th 774, 38 Cal.Rptr.3d 98, 126 P.3d 938, 961 (2006).\n\n\n. As the Supreme Court explained in Godinez, competence requires only the ability to rationally understand. In contrast, the plea is knowing if the defendant actually understands the proceedings. Godinez, 509 U.S. at 401 n. 12, 113 S.Ct. 2680. Thus, the expert opinions that Deere understood the proceedings also demonstrate that Deere\u2019s plea was knowing.\n\n\n. Deere's claim that the trial judge should have sua sponte held a competency hearing in 1982 fails because there was no evidence of his incompetence before the trial judge. Judge Metheny, the prosecutor and Mr. Jones all believed that Deere was competent. Deere\u2019s actions in court established that he understood the charges, understood the possible sentences, had extensively discussed his case with counsel, could state a factual basis for the plea, understood the rights he was waiving and could consult with counsel. He also gave rational reasons for pleading guilty and waiving a jury trial and his constitutional rights. Finally, the court-appointed psychiatrist found Deere competent, and both counsel stipulated to that competence finding. The trial court was entitled to rely on the competency determination. Wallace v. Stewart, 184 F.3d 1112, 1118 (9th Cir.1999). The record before the trial judge simply did not raise a bona fide doubt about Deere\u2019s competence to warrant a sua sponte hearing.\nDeere\u2019s claim that he was actually incompetent to plead guilty and stand trial fails because the state court's multiple, repeated competence findings are well-supported by the record. The new evidence, which we disfavor, simply does not provide the clear and convincing evidence necessary to overcome all of the evidence establishing that Deere was competent in 1982 and 1986.\n\n\n. Deere, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1187 n. 4.\n\n\n. Judge Metheny stated:\nYou might say what was committed here certainly was not an extensive crime. It had to do with an emotional situation. It has to do with the murder of people knowing one another. You can\u2019t compare it with organized crime ... where somebody was hired to go out and shoot people ...\n\n\n. THE COURT: ... Can you think of anything sadder you could do to a mother or father \u2014 a mother in this case. Losing a husband and two kids?\nTHE DEFENDANT: No.\nTHE COURT: Me either. I've thought about that. I\u2019ve thought about it a lot. When you go out and shoot somebody with a rifle \u2014 when you\u2019re in the service, it doesn\u2019t hurt you too much because you're told that is right. But stripping away the life of children and a husband from somebody that wasn't directly connected to you, that puts that into the aggravating circumstances to the extent that everything else I say is a bunch of nonsense. If you shot the Judge, it might have been different.\n\n\n. Deere wanted to depose Judge Metheny, obtain his medical records and subpoena \"any relevant records of complaints lodged with the Commission on Judicial Performance between 1982 and 1988 against\u201d the judge.\n\n\n. The dissent (but not Deere) argues that Judge Metheny exhibited \u201cmental incompetence\u201d at the penalty phase as evidenced by a discussion in which defense counsel requested that the judge rule that the aggravating evidence \"outweighed\u201d the mitigating evidence, all before any mitigating evidence was even presented. After Judge Metheny (and the prosecutor) expressed confusion about this request and sought clarification of what defense counsel was really seeking \u2014 basically, a ruling that the aggravating evidence was insufficient as a matter of law \u2014 Judge Methe-ny denied the request and required the presentation of mitigation, a ruling not disturbed on appeal.\n\n\n. The remaining claims Deere asserts on appeal were rejected by the district court. We affirm those rulings for the reasons set forth by Judges Taylor and Snyder, respectively.\n\n",

I disagree.\nA severely disturbed Ronnie Deere shot and killed Don Davis and Davis\u2019s two young daughters. Deeply remorseful, Deere convinced deputy public defender Glenn Jones to help him obtain a death sentence for his crimes. Deere pled guilty and waived a penalty-phase jury. Jones presented no mitigating evidence. Superior Court Judge Fred R. Metheny sentenced Deere to death in 1982. The California Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that a death sentence could not be imposed without the presentation of mitigating evidence. People v. Deere (Deere I), 41 Cal.3d 853, 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d 925 (1985). On remand in 1986, Jones again refused to present mitigating evidence. Judge Metheny again sentenced Deere to death, even though he had been specifically instructed by the Supreme Court not to do so without hearing mitigating evidence. Judge Metheny held a second penalty hearing a few months later, at which another attorney presented mitigating evidence. At that hearing, Judge Metheny sentenced Deere to death for the third time. The California Supreme Court affirmed. People v. Deere (Deere II), 53 Cal.3d 705, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d 1181 (1991).\nWhen Judge Metheny resentenced Deere to death in 1986, he was mentally incompetent. Three attorneys who appeared before Judge Metheny during this period provided affidavits in support of Deere\u2019s state and federal habeas petitions. The attorneys describe Judge Metheny as incompetent and report that his incompetence was general knowledge in the courthouse. The record of Deere\u2019s resen-tencing also shows Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence.\nI believe the evidence already in the record is sufficient to demonstrate that Judge Metheny was mentally incompetent when he resentenced Deere to death in 1986, but that is not the question before us today. The question now before us is much easier: Should the district court have granted an evidentiary hearing on Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence? The majority holds that such a hearing was not required. I disagree.\nIt is an open secret that some judges stay on the bench too long. Formal procedures exist for removing senile judges, but they are rarely employed. Attorneys hesitate to challenge judges they appear before, and judges hesitate to blow the whistle on their colleagues. I am as reluctant as most judges to seek to remove a senile judge or to set aside a decision reached by such a judge. But when a man\u2019s life is at stake, I cannot stay silent.\nI. Procedural Background\nDeere filed a federal habeas corpus petition in 1993, before the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Two federal dis*1153trict judges have dealt with his petition. District Judge Taylor denied Deere\u2019s petition in its entirety in 2001. On appeal from that denial, we wrote that Deere had \u201cc[o]me forward with sufficient evidence at least to trigger a hearing on whether he was, in fact, competent to have pleaded guilty.\u201d Deere v. Woodford, 339 F.3d 1084, 1086 (9th Cir.2003). We held that two declarations \u2018\u201ccreate[d] a real and substantial doubt\u2019 as to Deere\u2019s competency to plead guilty, if they [were] taken at face value and assumed to be true.\u201d Id. at 1087 (quoting Boag v. Raines, 769 F.2d 1341, 1343 (9th Cir.1985)). We remanded for a hearing \u201con Deere\u2019s claim that he was incompetent to plead guilty, and to reconsider the petition ... as to the claims premised on that contention.\u201d Id. We did not reach any other issues, including Judge Metheny\u2019s competence in 1986.\nDistrict Judge Snyder conducted the hearing on remand. In a careful forty-nine-page order, she concluded that Jones provided ineffective assistance of counsel (\u201cIAC\u201d). She held that Jones fell below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness and performed below the professional standard in his community at the time\u201d when he failed to investigate Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty. She held that Deere was prejudiced because there was a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\u201d Deere would have been found incompetent.\nThe State appeals Judge Snyder\u2019s decision. Deere continues to appeal Judge Taylor\u2019s decision. The panel majority reverses Judge Snyder\u2019s decision, affirms Judge Taylor\u2019s decision, and denies Deere\u2019s petition. I disagree with the majority on three issues.\nFirst, I would hold that the district court should have granted an evidentiary hearing on whether Judge Metheny was mentally competent when he sentenced Deere to death in 1986. Second, I would hold that the district court should have granted an evidentiary hearing on whether Jones provided IAC in failing to challenge Judge Metheny\u2019s competence in 1986. Third, agreeing with Judge Snyder, I would hold that Jones provided ineffective assistance in failing to investigate Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty in 1982.\nII. Judge Metheny\u2019s Competence in 1986\nA. Evidence of Incompetence\nJudge Metheny first sentenced Deere to death in 1982. The California Supreme Court reversed the death sentence because Jones had refused to present mitigating evidence and Judge Metheny had imposed the sentence without requiring Jones to do so. Deere I, 222 Cal.Rptr. 13, 710 P.2d at 934. The Court remanded for a new sentencing hearing, holding that a death sentence could not be imposed in the absence of mitigating evidence. Id.\nJudge Metheny conducted two resen-tencing hearings after remand. At the first hearing, held on April 21, 1986, Jones again refused to present mitigating evidence. Judge Metheny did not require mitigating evidence and sentenced Deere to death the next day. On May 14, Judge Metheny \u201cstayed\u201d the new death sentence by minute order. Even though stayed, the death sentence triggered an automatic appeal to the California Supreme Court. On June 9, the Court struck the judgment of death and \u201creturned [the case] to the superior court for further proceedings.\u201d\nOn June 27, 1986, Judge Metheny appointed attorney Jonathan Landau to present mitigating evidence on Deere\u2019s behalf as a friend of the court. A second resen-tencing hearing was held on July 18, 1986, at which Landau presented mitigating evidence. Judge Metheny sentenced Deere to death the same day. The California *1154Supreme Court affirmed. Deere II, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1195.\nEvidence of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental incompetence in 1986 falls into two categories. First, three attorneys who appeared before him provided affidavits in which they attest to Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence in 1986. Second, the record of Deere\u2019s 1986 resentencing, including but not limited to the transcripts, shows Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence.\n1. Attorneys\u2019 Affidavits\nThree attorneys who appeared before Judge Metheny in the 1980s provided sworn affidavits in support of Deere\u2019s 1993 state habeas petition. Those affidavits were later provided to the district court in support of Deere\u2019s federal habeas petition.\nAttorney Mark Sullivan wrote:\nI came to know Judge Fred Metheny in 1983 when he presided over a criminal case wherein I represented the defendant. That experience left me unwilling to risk the liberty of another of my clients in his hands. I resolved never to permit him to be involved in another criminal case of mine.\n... In a civil jury trial in 1984, Ohls-son v. Phillips, opposing counsel and I found ourselves bewildered by many of Judge Metheny\u2019s strange rulings and off-hand remarks to the jury. For example, despite the fact that my wife and I had never had any personal relationship whatsoever with Judge Metheny, he told jurors in the case that my wife constantly complained to him that I stayed out too late at night. This was out of the blue and not connected to anything that had transpired.\n... By 1986, the only matter of mine which I would agree to allow Judge Metheny to hear was McCready v. Moore, a Superior Court trial de novo of a small claims action. This matter was supposed to last a couple of hours, but we were in our third day of testimony when Judge Metheny appeared to become very frustrated. He stepped down from the bench and started shaking hands with all of the litigants seated at counsel table. Opposing counsel and I just looked at one another in amazement. Judge Metheny then went into the spectator section of the courtroom where many observers had been seated and started shaking hands with them. He told them that he assumed all of the people in his courtroom were Christians and attended church, and remarked upon our inability to settle the case. He then ordered the case dismissed. Opposing counsel and I reported this to the presiding judge, and Judge Noah Ned Jamin informed us that he would be retrying the case in its entirety, which is what he did.\n... As the years passed, it seemed as if his condition worsened considerably. It appeared as if he would float in and out of reality. He would not recognize people whom he had known for years. It was a very sad situation, because I am told that he was once a very likeable man.\nAttorney Taylor Huff wrote:\nI have worked in the Indio [public defender\u2019s] office since approximately March of 1985. I appeared before Judge Fred Metheny between five and ten times from 1985 until his retirement in 1989, but did not conduct any criminal trials before him....\nI did have occasion to appear before Judge Metheny for pretrial motions. I recall one lengthy suppression hearing which was held in 1985 in the case of People v. Dyer. It became obvious to me during that hearing that the judge had difficulty grasping the legal concepts involved; and his written ruling ... confirmed my opinion of his slipping grasp.\n*1155... I was aware of the penalty phase retrial ordered by the California Supreme Court in People v. Deere, as Mr. Deere was represented by Glenn Jones, another deputy in the Indio office. I observed part of these proceedings. In my opinion, it was not appropriate for this capital case to be reassigned to Judge Metheny; I do not believe he was then competent to sit in judgment of a capital case or other serious or complex criminal matters.\nAttorney Michael Kennedy wrote:\nI was a deputy district attorney in Indio, Palm Springs, and Blythe in 1983 and 1984 and entered private criminal defense practice in those areas in 1985. I had heard of Superior Court Judge Fred Metheny\u2019s reputation among the local prosecution and defense bars as being unable to render appropriate judicial services as long ago as about 1984, while I was still a prosecutor. I specifically recall my supervisor, then-Assistant District Attorney ... Thomas Douglass, Jr., commenting on his anxiety about having complicated evidentia-ry issues heard by Judge Metheny in about 1984. However, it was my impression that the D.A.\u2019s office did not want to shunt cases away from Judge Metheny ... because Judge Metheny\u2019s background as an F.B.I. agent (about which litigants were always regaled at length by the judge) caused him to in-stinetually err on the side of the People....\nIt was not until about 1988 that I had occasion to appear before Judge Methe-ny.... During those proceedings, ... Judge Metheny came off the bench, following an evidentiary objection by me, assumed a three-point stance on the floor in the open courtroom, ordered me to get down on the floor opposite him (to the horror of the on-looking spectators, court personnel, and my client), and threatened to knock me all the way out into the parking lot. When I declined to \u201cassume the position,\u201d the judge then got up and insisted that I accompany him to the parking lot so he could knock me around. He had, I believe, imagined he was back at Nebraska State, where he was a star football player in the '40\u2019s or thereabouts. That was one of his common regressions, witnessed by anyone foolish enough to take a case before him....\nI met with the presiding judge and the criminal calendar judge, who acknowledged the outrageousness of Judge Metheny\u2019s antics, and they requested that I not take the matter to the press or to the commission on judicial performance, given that it appeared that Judge Metheny would be retiring within several weeks.... I chastised these two judges for letting things get so far out of hand with a judge who they, and everyone, knew was not capable of handling the job, to the serious detriment of those whose liberties hang in the balance. They conceded it was a difficult matter to deal with and appeared to regret that things had gone on for so long. It seems that the problem was that Judge Metheny was always on the verge of retirement, for several years, so no one wanted to hurt an otherwise distinguished public servant in the twilight of his career. But those promised, serially impending retirements never materialized ....\n... In my opinion, based on what I heard and what I experienced, Judge Metheny was not competent to handle any serious criminal matter, much less a capital case, in 1986, nor do I believe that anyone who knew of the events of those days considered him competent for some undefined time before 1986.\nIn November 1987, The Press-Enterprise, a local newspaper of general circula*1156tion, rated judges on the Riverside County Superior Court based on a survey of lawyers and court staff. Judge Metheny was rated the \u201cworst\u201d judge on the Riverside bench by a considerable margin. The paper reported, \u201cHis detractors question his intelligence and clarity of thought.\u201d The paper continued:\n\u201cHe is in a complete fog,\u201d wrote one criminal law attorney with six years in Superior Court. \u201cDoesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, can\u2019t make a decision, only wants to talk about World War II and playing football for Nebraska.\u201d\nOne respondent wrote that Judge Metheny \u201chas simply been in the trenches too long\u201d; another stated that Judge Metheny \u201cappeared] to have little grasp of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n2. Record in Deere\u2019s 1986 Resentencing\nJudge Metheny\u2019s mental incompetence was painfully obvious during Deere\u2019s 1986 resentencing. It may be seen in exchanges in the courtroom, and in particular instances of inappropriate behavior. I will give examples of both.\nA lengthy exchange took place during the first of the two post-remand sentencing hearings, on April 21, 1986. The State\u2019s attorney, Robert Dunn, began the hearing by introducing transcripts and exhibits from the 1982 sentencing hearing. This evidence, in the State\u2019s view, showed aggravating circumstances warranting the death penalty. After submitting the evidence, Dunn said, \u201c[A]nd the people would rest.\u201d Judge Metheny accepted the evidence and shortly thereafter stated, \u201cYou haven\u2019t rested yet.\u201d Dunn repeated, \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to rest at this time.\u201d\nJones then moved for a ruling that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support a finding of aggravation. Jones said, \u201cI\u2019m asking the Court to make a ruling that what Mr. Dunn has offered you does not justify a finding in aggravation.\u201d Jones had made the same motion at Deere\u2019s first sentencing hearing in 1982, and Judge Metheny had denied it. Now, however, Judge Metheny did not understand the motion. He responded:\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position right now to grant the motion or deny the motion, either one. I think, assuming arguendo, that all the evidence to be introduced by the District Attorney has been offered. If this were the end of it and this were the last shot, it would be a different position for me to view from than if I allow you to go ahead and produce all the evidence that is available and you feel is necessary and proper and supportive, then there\u2019s an opportunity that comes back again to the prosecution and their right to produce additional evidence.\nJones replied, \u201cI don\u2019t disagree if the defendant offers evidence, but we haven\u2019t got to that stage yet.\u201d Judge Metheny then denied Jones\u2019s motion without prejudice.\nJones tried again:\nYour Honor, with respect I would ask the Court to articulate the factual findings that permits the Court to come to the decision that there are sufficient aggravating circumstances at this point to justify a finding of aggravating circumstances.\nJudge Metheny still did not understand:\nYes. Well, I think there\u2019s a conflict. If you could say it generally without doing two or three days of research on this matter, which may be necessary, but I hope not. I think we\u2019re still looking at this proposition. I\u2019m looking at the case right now although this is the first time I\u2019ve been through it. I haven\u2019t had an opportunity yet to review all the evidence that was dumped in. I think it was dumped in for a good reason. It\u2019s in now. It\u2019s been allowed in. *1157It\u2019s for me to review. The evidence as I recall it, and I haven\u2019t \u2014 and I have reviewed my files, what I think is available. I\u2019ve come to the feeling that what we discussed first of all is that here is a matter, a case that had to do with more than one murder. I think we\u2019re talking about murders at the same time, but there were three murders in this particular case and that would be aggravating if it does apply. I haven\u2019t made up my mind on that because this is a new trial for aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\nAnother thing to take into consideration is murder involves particularly heinous, atrocious, and cruel actions. Now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to come in on the evidence as far as that\u2019s concerned. It isn\u2019t in yet. You\u2019re asking me to do things ahead of time. That\u2019s just my comment on the side. I really don\u2019t have enough in my mind right now.\nThere is a possibility that we\u2019ll hear evidence to the effect that Mr. Deere was there and waiting, pursuing a victim while lying in wait. That\u2019s a possibility. But I don\u2019t see how you can ask me or force me now to state what you want me to state until you produce the evidence. I\u2019ve got to make that decision on evidence. I can\u2019t make it out of the wild blue yonder.\nDo you understand my position, Mr. Jones?\nJones tried once more:\nYour Honor, in all due respect, I do not. I apologize for saying that, but in the end using an analogy, it\u2019s as if we are in a criminal trial and the People have just rested and the defendant is making a motion for judgment upon insufficiency of evidence. We are now in a penalty trial. The People have rested offering their aggravating evidence. I\u2019m making a motion on that evidence asking the Court to make a finding of fact that their aggravating evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a finding of aggravating circumstances.\nJudge Metheny responded:\nI will. I will do that. But if this were the first time around and all this was put into evidence right now and you asked me to make your ruling right now I\u2019d say, hey look, I haven\u2019t had a chance to go over all this evidence yet. I don\u2019t have a memory, although I guess I am probably quite a bit smarter than most of the judges around here, but I don\u2019t like to brag about it. My memory isn\u2019t that implicit.\nJones suggested a brief recess to review the evidence, and Judge Metheny said:\nSay this was the way the case was handled the first time around. I\u2019d say wait a minute. I want to go over every one of these exhibits and go over the transcripts and find out actually what happened. We didn\u2019t have a lot on it. We didn\u2019t have a lot of the transcript except final argument. We spent a bit of time there. If you give me another two hours or so I would feel much more comfortable. I don\u2019t want to make any more mistakes. I want to do it not for myself or for you but for justice. I can\u2019t tell you right now.\nJones again suggested a recess. Judge Metheny then recessed for lunch. Upon reconvening, Judge Metheny said:\nI have done what I thought was absolutely necessary and that is to review the evidence and review the file again so that I\u2019m caught up-to-date as to what has happened and what is happening.\nWhere were we? A motion?\nAfter being reminded, Judge Metheny continued:\nAs I look at the situation at this point in time, if I were to balance the evidence *1158which, of course, isn\u2019t the proper thing to do now, I would have to, based on the evidence, deny the motion.\nJones asked again for Judge Metheny to \u201carticulate for the record what it finds in this case which justifies] a finding of aggravation. That\u2019s been my point all along.\u201d Judge Metheny neither gave the requested articulation nor provided a reason for not doing so.\nAfter Judge Metheny denied his motion, Jones refused to provide evidence in mitigation. District Attorney Dunn then suggested that Judge.Metheny hold Jones in contempt. Dunn emphasized to Judge Metheny that he was required to hear mitigating evidence before sentencing Deere, and that sentencing him without that evidence would be pointless. Judge Metheny did not hold Jones in contempt and did nothing else to secure the presentation of mitigating evidence.\nThe next day, without having heard any mitigating evidence, Judge Metheny sentenced Deere to death. After sentencing Deere, Judge Metheny informed him that he had sixty days to appeal. Jones reminded Judge Metheny that a death penalty appeal is automatic.\nWhen Judge Metheny resentenced Deere to death in April 1986, he did not understand what the California Supreme Court had told him to do. In 1982, Jones had refused to present mitigating evidence, and Judge Metheny had sentenced Deere to death. In Deere I, the California Supreme Court reversed and remanded for resentencing, specifically holding that a death sentence could not be imposed without the presentation of mitigating evidence. On April 21, 1986, Jones refused to present mitigating evidence, just as he had done four years earlier. On April 22, Judge Metheny sentenced Deere to death without having heard mitigating evidence, just as he had done in 1982. That is, Judge Metheny did precisely what the Supreme Court had unambiguously told him not to do.\nJudge Metheny also behaved inappropriately during Deere\u2019s post-remand resen-tencing. Two examples illustrate this point.\nFirst, Judge Metheny decided important issues without Jones or Deere being present. On May 14, 1986, Judge Metheny \u201cstayed\u201d Deere\u2019s April 22 death sentence and appointed an investigator to look for mitigating evidence. The minute order indicates that the prosecutor and Jones were present in the courtroom during proceedings leading to the entry of the order. The next day, Jones wrote a letter requesting that the minute order be changed to reflect the fact that he had not been present. There may, in fact, have been no open courtroom proceedings leading to the minute order. Despite extensive effort, no transcript for May 14 has been located. Judge Metheny may have decided, without notice or hearing, to stay Deere\u2019s death sentence and to appoint an investigator; or he may have held a hearing off the record without either Jones or Deere being present. Judge Metheny held another hearing a month and a half later, on June 27, 1986, at which he appointed Jonathan Landau to supervise the investigation, present mitigation evidence, and act as a friend-of-the-court at a new sentencing hearing. Judge Metheny also established various procedures, withdrew the order of contempt against Jones, and affirmed that Jones would continue representing Deere. Deere was not present in the courtroom, and there was no waiver of his presence.\nSecond, Judge Metheny made direct off-the-record contacts with witnesses. During the June 27 hearing at which Deere was not present, Judge Metheny stated, \u201cBut, as I understand the situation, we have been mighty successful with Mr. Deere\u2019s family. I have contacted them *1159directly and a number of other people who would be happy to testify the way Justice Mosk wants them to testify.\u201d Judge Metheny also appears to have contacted Deere\u2019s father at some point, for Judge Metheny stated during Deere\u2019s second re-sentencing, \u201cI think Mr. Deere\u2019s father talked to him about it. I don\u2019t think Mr. Deere knows that I know as much as I do about this case.\u201d\nThere is direct evidence that Judge Metheny interviewed Deere\u2019s mother and two sisters in chambers off the record at the second penalty retrial. Deere\u2019s mother stated in a declaration presented to both the state and federal habeas courts:\nMe and my daughters Jeannie and Karen went to the second trial, the penalty trial I think they called it.... [W]e talked to the judge in his chambers. I can\u2019t remember if I testified. All I remember was going into the judge\u2019s chambers and him asking us if we thought Ronnie could be rehabilitated.\nDeere\u2019s sister Jeannie DeLeon also remembered the incident. She stated in her declaration:\nAfter we testified, the judge asked us to go into his chambers to talk about Ronnie. He asked us a lot of things about Ronnie, about what kind of life Ronnie would lead if his sentence was overturned. It was real emotional back there.\n3. Majority\u2019s Response\nThe panel majority refuses to recognize the extent and strength of the evidence of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental incompetence. According to the majority, the evidence \u201creveal[s] no more than eccentricity.\u201d Op. at 1127.\nFirst, the majority focuses on a single sentence in the California Supreme Court\u2019s Deere II opinion that addresses Judge Metheny\u2019s consideration of the evidence. The sentence upon which the majority relies is italicized in the block quotation that appears below. In the view of the majority, this sentence is the \u201cmost important ]\u201d factor. \u201cThis alone compels the conclusion that Judge Metheny was not impaired[.]\u201d Op. at 1151. The majority takes the Court\u2019s sentence out of context. The Court was responding to an argument that in 1986 Judge Metheny had not been impartial, and that the death sentence was therefore a \u201cmockery.\u201d The Court wrote:\nOn the contrary, the record indicates that the trial court remained scrupulously fair and objective throughout the proceedings. It carefully weighed and considered both the aggravating and mitigating evidence after they were presented. Indeed, neither defense counsel nor Mr. Landau [who was appointed for the purpose of presenting mitigating evidence] challenged the impartiality of the trial court at any point during the proceedings.\nDeere II, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1195.\nAs the full passage makes clear, the Court was not ruling on Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence. Indeed, the issue of Judge Metheny\u2019s competence was never raised in the direct appeal to the Court. Instead, in the passage just quoted, the Court was ruling on Judge Metheny\u2019s impartiality. District Judge Taylor correctly understood the limited scope of the California Supreme Court\u2019s statement. He wrote:\n[The Court\u2019s] findings were made on claims that \u201cthe record [wa]s \u2018ambiguous\u2019 as to the standards which the trial court applied in determining the penalty, and thus that the sentence is constitutionally unreliable,\u201d and that the resen-tencing was a \u201cmockery.\u201d [Deere II, 280 Cal.Rptr. 424, 808 P.2d at 1194.] Thus, in terms of a claim of mental incompetency on the part of the trial *1160judge, these factual findings do not preclude relief.\nSecond, the majority writes that Judge Metheny was sailing in \u201cunchartered waters\u201d when Jones refused to present mitigating evidence on April 21, and when Judge Metheny sentenced Deere to death the next day. Op. at 1149-50. The majority writes, \u201c[Tjhere is simply no evidence \u2014 none\u2014that this ruling was other than legal error committed when the judge was confronted with a highly unusual situation.\u201d Id. at 1150. The majority is wrong. The waters were hardly uncharted. What happened in April 1986 was a precise repeat of what had happened in 1982, and the legal issue in 1986 was the precise issue that the California Supreme Court decided in Deere I. The conclusion is inescapable that Judge Metheny\u2019s mental disability was so severe in April 1986 that he simply could not understand the Court\u2019s clear holding in Deere I.\nThird, the majority contends that Judge Metheny\u2019s odd statements are merely \u201cout-of-context excerpts.\u201d Id. at 1150. The majority has inadvertently put its finger on part of the problem. Many of Judge Metheny\u2019s comments are indeed out of context. They are oddly irrelevant comments that come out of the blue. More important, the majority fails to take into account Judge Metheny\u2019s in-context remarks. The excerpts from the April 21 hearing, quoted at length above in order to provide context, show in excruciating detail the degree to which Judge Metheny was mentally impaired.\nFourth, the majority belittles the affidavits presented by attorneys Huff, Kennedy, and Sullivan. In the view of the majority, attorney Huffs \u201cdeclaration boils down to his personal opinion.\u201d Op. at 1150. Attorney Kennedy\u2019s \u201cdeclaration speaks of \u2018rumors.\u2019 \u201d Id. Attorney Sullivan\u2019s \u201cdeclaration speaks of \u2018strange rulings,\u2019 not otherwise identified\u201d; recounts an \u201cinexplicable statement\u201d without providing a transcript; and recounts an \u201cevent\u201d in 1986 that \u201cshows a judge who became exasperated and blew his stack.\u201d Id. at 1151. I disagree. The affidavits of Huff, Kennedy, and Sullivan are serious assessments by serious professionals. Huff, Kennedy, and Sullivan practiced before Judge Metheny, directly observed the behavior they describe, and they knew Judge Metheny\u2019s reputation in the courthouse. All of them concluded that Judge Metheny was incompetent. These attorneys\u2019 affidavits are not casual, offhand, or unsupported evaluations. They are, instead, a terrifying window into Judge Metheny\u2019s courtroom.\nFifth, the majority faults Deere for not providing any medical evaluations of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence to serve as a judge in 1986. The majority writes, \u201cDespite having access to a veritable stable of mental health professionals who could have reviewed the transcripts \u2014 Dr. Jones, Dr. Rosenthal, Dr. Favazza, Dr. Stewart \u2014 not one has opined that Judge Metheny\u2019s statements are evidence of a disordered mind.\u201d Op. at 1150. I do not fault Deere for not asking Drs. Jones, Rosenthal, Favazza and Stewart to evaluate Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence. They were retained for the specific purpose of evaluating Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty in 1982.\nMoreover, because attorneys and judges are trained to understand legal rules and legal reasoning, they are in some respects better able than medical professionals to assess competence to serve as a judge. The question now before us is whether the district court should have allowed an investigation and evidentiary hearing concerning the mental competence of Judge Metheny. At some point, it may become necessary to have the evaluation of a developed record by medical professionals, *1161but I emphatically do not believe such an evaluation is required at this stage.\nB. Habeas Claims Related to Judge Metheny\u2019s Mental Competence\nI would reverse two holdings of the district court related to Judge Metheny\u2019s mental competence. First, I would hold that the district court erred in refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing concerning Judge Metheny\u2019s competence. Second, I would hold that the district court erred in refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing on whether Jones committed IAC by failing to seek recusal of Judge Metheny based on his incompetence.\n1. Evidentiary Hearing on Judge Metheny\u2019s Competence\nThe case law on due process violations resulting from mental incompetence of the decisionmaker is sparse but clear. The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally, \u201cThis Court has recognized that a defendant has a right to \u2018a tribunal both impartial and mentally competent to afford a hearing.\u2019 \u201d Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 126, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987) (emphasis added) (quoting Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U.S. 167, 176, 32 S.Ct. 651, 56 L.Ed. 1038 (1912)). In Jordan, the Court held that it would violate due process if an insane person were permitted to sit on a jury in a criminal case. Jordan, 225 U.S. at 176, 32 S.Ct. 651. The Court held that due process had not been violated only because the state court, after an evidentiary hearing, had concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that the juror in question was sane. Id. at 173, 32 S.Ct. 651.\nA federal habeas petitioner in a pre-AEDPA case is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if \u201c(1) the petitioner\u2019s allegations, if proved, would entitle him to relief, and (2) the state court trier of fact has not, after a full and fair hearing, reliably found the relevant facts.\u201d Williams v. Calderon, 52 F.3d 1465, 1484 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting Hendricks v. Vasquez, 974 F.2d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Stankewitz v. Woodford, 365 F.3d 706, 714 (9th Cir.2004). It is undisputed that Deere requested an evi-dentiary hearing on state habeas concerning Judge Metheny\u2019s competence and that his request was denied. Deere thus satisfied the second criterion, as the district court correctly held. The disputed question is whether Deere satisfied the first criterion.\nDeere has alleged that Judge Metheny was so mentally impaired in 1986 that he was incompetent to preside over his capital sentencing. Because Deere waived a jury, Judge Metheny himself was required to decide whether Deere would live or die.\nDeere has not only alleged facts that would entitle him to habeas relief. He has also provided substantial evidence in support of his allegations. The district court nonetheless denied Deere an evidentiary hearing. The district judge concluded, \u201cViewed as a whole, the trial judge\u2019s conduct and statements during the proceedings in 1982 and 1986 do not support Petitioner\u2019s allegations.\u201d (To be clear, I do not contend that Judge Metheny was incompetent in 1982. I contend only that he was incompetent in 1986.) The district court did not describe the attorneys\u2019 affidavits, nor any of the other evidence in the record, in explaining its conclusion. The district court concluded that Deere was not entitled to a hearing because the attorneys involved in the case failed to raise the issue of Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence. The court wrote that attorneys Jones and Landau \u201cwere in the best position to observe the competency of the trial judge in 1982 and 1986.\u201d It wrote further, \u201c[Appellate counsel and the prosecutor also appeared before the trial judge, and neither attorney ever made any kind of a *1162record regarding the alleged incompetency of the trial judge.\u201d\nGiven the evidence in the record, the district court should not have attached controlling importance to the silence of the attorneys. Lawyers are loathe to challenge as incompetent the judge before whom they are appearing, and before whom they might appear again. In Deere\u2019s case, each of the attorneys had a particular reason not to challenge Judge Metheny. The two defense attorneys in the trial court were Jones and Landau. Jones was actively trying to help Deere get a death sentence, and it was relatively clear that Judge Metheny would impose such a sentence. Landau was not Deere\u2019s attorney in the normal sense; he was retained as a friend of the court for the sole purpose of presenting mitigating evidence at the second resentencing hearing. Further, the prosecutor at trial was following office policy in not objecting to Judge Metheny. As recounted by attorney Kennedy in his affidavit, the prosecutor\u2019s office had a policy of keeping their cases before Judge Metheny, despite his incompetence, because he \u201cin-stinctually err[ed] on the side of the People.\u201d Finally, an appellate lawyer, even if he had wanted to raise the issue of Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence, would have known that the issue would be properly raised on collateral rather than direct review.\nThere was considerable evidence of Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence that the district court declined to describe. I have summarized that evidence above. In my view, that evidence, if believed, is enough to support a determination that Judge Metheny was so mentally impaired he could not, consistent with due process, preside over Deere\u2019s resentencing in 1986. At a bare minimum, Deere was entitled on federal habeas corpus to a hearing on his claim that Judge Metheny was incompetent in 1986. At such a hearing, Deere would have been allowed to introduce additional evidence of Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence. The State, of course, would have been allowed to introduce its own evidence, if any, and to cross-examine any of Deere\u2019s witnesses.\nI realize that Judge Metheny has been dead for many years, and that it will be difficult to determine, more than 25 years after the fact, the precise degree of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental impairment in 1986. It would have been far preferable to have had an evidentiary hearing in 1993, when the issue was first presented to the state and federal habeas courts. It would also have been preferable in 2003, when we remanded to the district court for a hearing concerning Deere\u2019s competence, to have remanded at the same time for a hearing concerning Judge Metheny\u2019s competence. Over my objection, the panel majority declined to add to our 2003 remand order a direction to conduct such a hearing.\nI also realize that inquiries into the mental competence of judges pose difficulties. I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by my colleague, then-judge Ko-zinski, in his dissenting opinion in Summerlin v. Stewart, 267 F.3d 926, 957 (9th Cir.2001) (Kozinski, J., dissenting), opinion withdrawn, Summerlin v. Stewart, 310 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir.2002). In a perfect world, all judges would retire before their mental faculties deteriorate to the point where they are no longer competent to perform as judges. In that world, we would not be faced with the difficult problem of forcing, or encouraging, our colleagues to retire, or with the equally difficult problem of dealing with cases decided by judges who were, or might have been, incompetent.\nBut this is not a perfect world. Some judges stay on too long. They decide cases when they are no longer competent *1163to do so. There is credible evidence of mental incompetence in the record before us. Deere has not embarked on a fishing expedition in which he hopes to find evidence of incompetence. He already has such evidence, a lot of it. There may be more evidence still to be found, but Deere has already presented enough to warrant a hearing.\nI therefore conclude that the district court erred in refusing to hold an eviden-tiary hearing on whether Judge Metheny was mentally competent when he sentenced Deere to death in 1986.\n2. IAC for Failing to Seek Recusal of Judge Metheny\nIn his state habeas petition, Deere requested an evidentiary hearing on whether Jones committed IAC in failing to seek recusal of Judge Metheny. The state court denied the request. The district court on federal habeas also denied Deere\u2019s request for a hearing on Jones\u2019s alleged IAC in failing to seek recusal based on Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence.\nTo establish IAC, Deere must show (1) that Jones\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) that the performance prejudiced his defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). An attorney\u2019s performance is deficient when \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id. There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within \u201cthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.\nIf Jones had successfully moved in 1986 to recuse Judge Metheny based on incompetence, Judge Metheny would not have been permitted to resentence Deere. A due process violation based on a valid objection to a sitting judge is structural error such that reversal or vacation of the judge\u2019s order or judgment is automatic. Turney v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 535, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927); Greenway v. Schriro, 653 F.3d 790, 805 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201c[WJhen a defendant\u2019s right to have his case tried by an impartial judge is compromised, there is structural error that requires automatic reversal.\u201d); see also Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 883-84, 129 S.Ct. 2252, 173 L.Ed.2d 1208 (2009) (in a case of alleged judicial bias, a litigant need not demonstrate actual bias, but rather only a sufficient \u201crisk\u201d of bias).\nDeere has presented substantial evidence that Judge Metheny was mentally incompetent in 1986 when he resentenced Deere to death. Deere had convinced Jones that he wanted to die. Jones and Deere struck a \u201cdeal\u201d whereby Jones would do almost nothing to avoid the death penalty. I do not believe that such a deal \u2014 even if Deere had been competent to make it \u2014 permitted Jones, consistent with his duties as an attorney, to permit a violation of due process by allowing a mentally incompetent judge to decide whether his client should live or die.\nA showing of prejudice under Strickland requires a showing that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that Jones would have succeeded in 1986 if he had moved to recuse Judge Metheny on grounds of incompetence. The evidence already in the record is more than sufficient to show that such a motion by Jones would have been successful. The affidavits of Huff, Kennedy, and Sullivan show that Judge Metheny was incompetent in 1986, and that his in*1164competence was widely known. More specifically, Sullivan\u2019s affidavit recounts that he and his opposing counsel went to the presiding judge in 1986 when Judge Meth-eny came down off the bench, shook hands with the spectators, commented on their Christianity, and dismissed the small civil case in the middle of trial. The presiding judge, well aware of Judge Metheny\u2019s mental state, promptly reassigned the case and retried it himself. If the presiding judge was willing in 1986 to reassign this relatively inconsequential case because of Judge Metheny\u2019s incompetence, there can hardly be any doubt that he would have reassigned Deere\u2019s capital case if Jones had sought recusal.\nI therefore conclude that the district court erred in refusing to hold an eviden-tiary hearing on whether Jones committed IAC in failing to seek recusal of Judge Metheny.\nIII. Deere\u2019s Competence in 1982\nWe remanded in 2003 for an evidentiary hearing on issues related to Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty in 1982. After an extensive hearing, the district court concluded that Jones committed IAC in failing to challenge Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty.\nI agree with the district court that there is a reasonable probability that, had attorney Jones properly investigated, Deere would have been found incompetent to plead guilty.\nA. Background\nDeere was born in 1954. He is of Creek and Seminole heritage through his father. Deere was one of eight children in a very poor family. Deere\u2019s father was a violent alcoholic who abused his wife and beat his children until they bled. Deere\u2019s mother sometimes beat him. The family moved to Blythe, California, from Oklahoma so that Deere\u2019s parents could work as farm laborers. During his childhood, Deere was exposed to pesticides and pollutants in the nearby fields and in the drinking, irrigation, and swimming water.\nDeere suffered three or perhaps four episodes of convulsions before he was one year old. He was placed in special education in the third grade because of attention and personality problems. At age ten, Deere had a full-scale I.Q. of 76, which placed him in the sixth percentile. When Deere was ten or eleven years old, he grabbed bare electrical wires and remained in contact with the current for several minutes. The shock adversely affected his coordination. Deere began cutting himself by age eleven. He began running away from home by age twelve. Deere dropped out of school in the eighth grade. He was committed to the California Youth Authority at age thirteen or fourteen.\nDeere continued to cut himself in his adulthood, leaving long and deep scars all over his body. Deere repeatedly asked Alice Lyon, the mother of his first daughter, to kill him. Once, after he had seriously cut his hand, he asked police officers to let him die. On another occasion, when police found Deere bleeding from six-inch cuts on both arms and a smaller cut on his chest, Deere refused medical attention. Deere frequently came to the attention of local police for conduct including alcohol-related offenses, disturbing the peace, stealing a cow, and possessing a concealed weapon.\nDeere had a tumultuous relationship with Cindy Gleason, the mother of his second daughter. In the six months before the murders, Deere\u2019s self-mutilation increased, and he drank a fifth of vodka each day. Cindy left Deere in January 1982, taking their baby to her mother\u2019s house. Deere began threatening Cindy and her family, including threatening to *1165kill family members if Cindy left him and took the baby away permanently.\nOn January 12, 1982, Deere and Cindy met with social worker Virginia Erickson Tiernan. Tiernan noticed a seven- or eight-inch cut on Deere\u2019s arm. Deere told Tiernan that if he did not cut himself, he would hurt others. Tiernan was concerned that Deere was mentally ill and suggested that he go to the local mental-health center. An intake worker at the center diagnosed Deere with marital problems, alcohol abuse, and antisocial personality disorder.\nIn February 1982, Deere and Cindy briefly reconciled but again separated. Deere\u2019s self-mutilation and substance abuse increased, and he again began threatening Cindy and her family. In the two weeks before the murders, Cindy and her mother called Tiernan two or three times each night. Tiernan regularly asked the sheriff, probation department, and police for help, reporting Deere\u2019s threats against Cindy and her family.\nOn February 22, 1982, Cindy called Tiernan twice asking for help. Tiernan advised Cindy to get Deere \u201cinto mental health\u201d and tried the next day to get Deere placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold. On the advice of the probation department, Deere returned to the mental-health center on February 25, 1982. The intake worker noticed a cut on Deere\u2019s forearm, but noted that there was \u201cno indication\u201d of any \u201cdanger to self\u2019 and instructed Deere to keep his normal appointment for the next week.\nOn March 3, 1982, Cindy called the police to ask for help. Cindy\u2019s mother called the supervising psychologist at the mental-health center, who told Cindy\u2019s mother that he could not see Deere unless she and Cindy went through \u201cthe proper channels.\u201d Cindy called the probation department for help the next day, March 4, 1982. The probation department told Cindy to call the same supervising psychologist. The supervising psychologist told Cindy to set up an appointment. On the afternoon of March 4, Cindy\u2019s former brother-in-law Don Davis picked up his two daughters, Cindy\u2019s nieces, for visitation. Witnesses reported seeing Deere that evening at a local market, drunk or in a daze. That night, Cindy and her sister drove to Davis\u2019s trailer and found the bodies of Davis and the two girls.\nFive days later, police found Deere in the desert, missing his shirt and a shoe. Deere told the police he had been living on ditch water and raw birds. He had with him notes he had addressed to Cindy and his parents. Police found a .22 rifle with writing scratched into the wood stock: \u201cif you have gone to doctor I got end the mean Ronnie I wish I understood \u2014 Kathy she help kill them now love her \u2014 Now live with it for life \u2014 you killed them to \u2014 Shorty [Cindy] you hurt like me how dose [sic] feel.\u201d\nB. Proceedings Leading to Deere\u2019s Guilty Plea\nOn the afternoon of March 9, 1982, after Deere\u2019s arrest but before appointment of defense counsel, Dr. Tommy Bolger interviewed Deere at the jail. Dr. Bolger had never received formal psychiatric training. He had received a degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine in 1957 and had become a Medical Doctor in 1962 as a result of the California Reunification Act. Dr. Bolger spent most of his career working in the California state prison system. From 1965 to 1970, he worked under the classification \u201cPhysician and Surgeon II\u201d at Patton State Hospital. He then worked as a \u201cChief Medical Officer\u201d at San Quentin prison in 1975 and a \u201cPhysician and Surgeon\u201d at Soledad prison from 1975 to 1977. He received a classification as a \u201cStaff Psychiatrist\u201d at Soledad in 1977. He vol*1166untarily resigned from state service in 1979 and moved to Blythe, where he worked for Riverside County as a \u201cmedical and psychiatric consultant.\u201d\nDr. Bolger spoke with Deere for an hour and five minutes. He prepared a report for the police in which he stated, \u201cHis intellectual capacity is adjudged a dull normal,\u201d and \u201cJudgement is narrowed and constricted.\u201d Dr. Bolger provided what he called a \u201cdiagnostic impression\u201d: \u201c1) Not mentally ill[.] 2) Dependant personality type, with explosive features, Alcohol and drugs a factor. 3) Antisocial personality type, with borderline features, not psychotic.\u201d Dr. Bolger concluded:\nMr. Deere is not mentally ill. He has a severe personality problem. He does understand the nature and [sic] the charges against him and was certainly capable of forming the intent and then carrying out the action. He is capable of cooperating with Counsel in his defense, if he feels it is to his advantage.\nDr. Bolger had interviewed Deere a year earlier in connection with treatment of Deere\u2019s father for seizures and mental health problems linked to alcoholism. At that time, Dr. Bolger had concluded that statements by Deere were \u201cmerely [Deere\u2019s] attempt to blame his problems on someone else.\u201d Dr. Bolger did not disclose in his report to the police that he had previously interviewed and formed an impression of Deere. He testified in 1986 that he had had no knowledge of Deere before the 1982 jail interview.\nThe day after Deere\u2019s jail interview with Dr. Bolger, the court appointed deputy public defender Glenn Jones to represent Deere. Deere told Jones that he did not want a trial, did not want a defense, and wanted to be executed. Deere refused to discuss the facts of the case with Jones and insisted on pleading guilty.\nDeere initially pled not guilty, but later moved to change his plea to guilty. On the recommendation of the prosecutor, the court appointed Dr. Bolger to evaluate Deere\u2019s competence before taking his guilty plea. The prosecutor represented to the court that Dr. Bolger was a board-certified psychiatrist. Dr. Bolger himself sometimes represented that he was a board-certified psychiatrist, even though he was not. It appears to have been common knowledge in the community that Dr. Bolger was not a qualified psychiatrist. Dr. William Jones, the psychologist that attorney Jones later retained to evaluate Deere for mental health defenses, testified in the district court that attorney Jones\ncharacterized Dr. Bolger as sort of a hack. No one else would go to Blythe, so they used him in that area. It was someone who had no formal psychiatric training whatsoever[.]\nDr. Bolger interviewed Deere for about an hour and a half on June 19, 1982, and submitted a short report to the court on June 21. Dr. Bolger wrote that Deere had been given two intelligence tests. In his earlier report to the police, Dr. Bolger had written that Deere\u2019s intellectual capacity was \u201cdull normal,\u201d and that he had \u201cnarrowed and constricted\u201d judgment. But in the June report to the court, Dr. Bolger reported that Deere was intelligent and had good judgment. Dr. Bolger wrote: \u201cHe is given verbal Wechsler and verbal 0[fficer] intelligence] T[est] and scores adequately in the high percentile range.\u201d \u201cJudgement as tested by verbal skills in aforementioned verbal testing is excellent. ... His I.Q. would be adjudged to be in the high range of normal.\u201d There is no indication in the record that Dr. Bolger\u2019s earlier report to the police was ever submitted to the court. Dr. Bolger did not reveal in his report to the court that he had prepared a report for the police or that he had interviewed and formed an impression of Deere a year earlier. Dr. *1167Bolger concluded in his report to the court that Deere was competent to plead guilty.\nOn June 25, Deere pled guilty to three counts of murder and admitted a special circumstance allegation. At the time of Deere\u2019s plea, attorney Jones had requested but had not yet received a psychological evaluation. Attorney Jones had seen the scars of self-inflicted wounds on Deere\u2019s arms, chest, and abdomen. He had recognized signs of possible mental illness and had requested funds from the court to retain mental-health experts. (Jones ultimately spent only $1,696.86 of the $5,000 the court awarded for this purpose.) Jones contacted Dr. William Jones, Ph.D. (no relation), a licenced psychologist, and asked him to do a general psychological evaluation of Deere.\nDeere initially refused to see Dr. Jones. He agreed to see Dr. Jones only on the condition that Attorney Jones allow him to plead guilty. Dr. Jones interviewed Deere twice. The first interview took place two days before Deere pled guilty. The second interview took place a week later. The first interview took an hour and a half, followed by two and a half hours of psychological testing. The second interview lasted only thirty minutes. Dr. Jones testified in the district court that Deere refused to complete the second interview because \u201che was not able to deal with the emotions\u201d of discussing the crime or the death penalty.\nAttorney Jones did not ask Dr. Jones to evaluate Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty. Dr. Jones testified in the district court that it was standard procedure in the profession in 1982 not to give an opinion on competence unless asked to do so. Dr. Jones wrote in his report that Deere frequently cut himself to avoid hurting others, \u201chas a very major alcohol abuse problem,\u201d and \u201cha[s] a major drug abuse problem.\u201d He reported that Deere\u2019s full-scale I.Q. on the \u201cWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised\u201d tested at the 7th percentile, or borderline retarded. Deere\u2019s Wechsler \u201cverbal I.Q.\u201d tested \u201cat the 6th percentile, also in the borderline range.\u201d (Recall that Dr. Bolger reported to the court that Deere had scored \u201cin the high percentile range\u201d on this same Wech-sler test.) The tests showed, further, that Deere had reading recognition at about the sixth grade level, in the fifth percentile of persons his age; spelling at the fourth grade level, in the first percentile; and arithmetic at the third grade level, in the fifth percentile.\nDr. Jones diagnosed Deere as having an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, mixed substance abuse disorder, and borderline personality disorder with anti-social aspects. Dr. Jones wrote that Deere had had a long-standing desire to be killed, and that he pled guilty so that the State would fulfill this desire:\nHe feels that suicide cannot be forgiven, but that it is permissible for someone else to kill him. Consequently, he states that he has frequently asked others to kill him and stab him. He has even paid money for this and on one occasion apparently was stabbed.\nPresently Mr. Deere states that he does not care in the slightest what happens to him. He states that if he is given the death penalty he is willing to accept it and indeed would prefer it to life imprisonment. He thinks this would make him feel better, but he is unclear as to how he would feel better if he were dead.\nDr. Jones testified at the evidentiary hearing in the district court that he had been concerned about Deere\u2019s competence, and had expressed his concerns orally to attorney Jones:\nI have a recollection that we talked either in person \u2014 I believe in person or on the telephone before I prepared the re-\n*1168port. I recall having a \u2014 this conversation sticks in my mind more vividly than anything else about this case. The issue on one hand, my reservations that he was so self-destructive and on [attorney Jones\u2019s] hand the idea ... that opting for the death penalty was, in fact, a rational thing for Mr. Deere to do at the time and not, in fact, a \u2014 something reflecting incompetence.\nWhen asked at the evidentiary hearing if in 1982 he had \u201cfelt Deere was incompetent\u201d and had \u201cin essence ... told [attorney Jones] that,\u201d Dr. Jones replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\nC. District Court Proceedings\nThe district court conducted extensive proceedings after our 2003 remand. The State and Deere both introduced evidence concerning Deere\u2019s competence in 1982.\n1. The State\u2019s Evidence\nThe State\u2019s evidence consisted of Dr. Bolger\u2019s reports and the report and testimony by Dr. Park Dietz. Dr. Bolger had died by the time of the district court hearing, so the State relied on the two reports he prepared in 1982, both of which are described above.\nDr. Dietz is a board-certified psychiatrist, but he has not treated patients since 1988. He testified that he is the \u201chead\u201d of two corporations, one of which provides expert psychiatric testimony in criminal cases. This firm employs a substantial staff of experts \u201cfrom various disciplines.\u201d Dr. Dietz described the manner in which his firm prepares cases:\nBasically, we seek to obtain all the relevant documents that we can foresee or that the client allows us to know exists. So we typically send a list of documents that we\u2019re requesting.... And then depending on the complexity of the case, the quantity of the documents sometimes more than one expert will work on it. On a simple case with a small stack of documents often that will just be one person\u2019s work. But if there are multiple issues, multiple areas of expertise or extensive documents, we\u2019ll often involve additional experts on the case.\nDr. Dietz has testified in a number of high-profile criminal cases in federal and state court. In somewhere between 80 percent to 90 percent of the cases, Dr. Dietz has testified for the prosecution.\nDr. Dietz did not interview Deere. He testified that his declaration and his testimony were primarily based on the observations of attorney Jones and to some degree on the reports of Dr. Bolger. Dr. Dietz concluded in his declaration, \u201cMr. Deere was, in my judgment, competent each time he was examined by the court,\u201d including the occasion on \u201c6/25/92 [sic], when Mr. Deere advised the court that it was his wish to change his plea from not guilty to guilty on all counts.\u201d Dr. Dietz testified that Deere\u2019s history and symptoms were \u201cproof\u2019 that he had \u201ca borderline personality disorder.\u201d He testified, \u201cMr. Deere\u2019s borderline personality disorder did not in my view make him incompetent to enter into the decisions he did in 1982.\u201d\nDr. Dietz relied for his diagnosis in substantial part on a number of statements made by attorney Jones. For example, Dr. Dietz quoted Jones as saying, \u201cHe knows the consequences of every decision he\u2019s made, as well as the consequences of his criminal acts.... They are rational, intelligent decisions by a man who realizes what he has done and says, \u2018This is the only position I can take to show you that I am still a man and not an animal.\u2019 \u201d\nDr. Dietz also testified that he trusted Dr. Bolger\u2019s \u201cobservations\u201d:\nDr. Bolger\u2019s report contains enough descriptive information of Dr. Bolger\u2019s observations to support the opinion he offers in this report. And judged by the *1169standards of the day, it was an average or above average competency evaluation.\nDr. Dietz admitted that Dr. Bolger had made a mistake in \u201cestimating\u201d Deere\u2019s I.Q. He wrote in his declaration:\nDr. Bolger could be faulted by the standards of the day for estimating Mr. Deere\u2019s IQ as too high (\u201chigh range of normal\u201d) in his report of 6/21/82 and for less than laudatory writing skill.\n(Emphasis added.) Dr. Dietz described in his district-court testimony how he thought Dr. Bolger had arrived at his \u201cestimate\u201d that Deere\u2019s I.Q. was in the \u201chigh range of normal\u201d:\nWell, what he did was an impressionistic evaluation of intelligence, which was fairly common then and many people still do it which is give an off-the-cuff idea of whether they think someone is above average or below average without any testing of that. And his off-the-cuff finding was wrong.\n(Emphasis added.) Deere\u2019s attorney asked Dr. Dietz whether Dr. Bolger\u2019s mistake in his \u201cestimate\u201d of Deere\u2019s I.Q. was \u201ca fatal error in his report that makes his conclusion erroneous?\u201d Dr. Dietz replied, \u201cNo. The only way it could be is if it turned, out by objective evidence that Mr. Deere was mentally retarded.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nDr. Jones had concluded in 1982 that Deere was incompetent to plead guilty because he had long felt a compulsion to seek death, had felt that it wrong for him to kill himself, and had desired to be killed by someone else. Deere\u2019s three other professional witnesses agreed with Dr. Jones\u2019s conclusion that Deere\u2019s mental illnesses drove his compulsion to die and thus his decision to plead guilty. Dr. Dietz disagreed with the conclusion that Deere had a \u201ccompulsion\u201d to seek death. However, his disagreement was based on a narrow technical definition of \u201ccompulsion\u201d that requires the sufferer of the disorder to be self-aware, such that the sufferer is himself aware that his actions are \u201cexcessive or unreasonable.\u201d\nDr. Dietz made two obvious mistakes in his testimony. First, Dr. Dietz stated that Dr. Bolger could be forgiven for merely \u201cestimating\u201d Deere\u2019s I.Q. \u201cwithout any testing.\u201d Dr. Dietz had not been told, or perhaps did not remember, that Dr. Bol-ger had not merely \u201cestimated\u201d Deere\u2019s intelligence. Rather, Dr. Bolger had performed two separate intelligence tests. Dr. Bolger had stated in his report to the court: \u201cHe is given verbal Wechsler and verbal 0[fficer] intelligence] T[est] and scores adequately in the high percentile range.\u201d\nSecond, Dr. Dietz minimized the importance of Dr. Bolger\u2019s mistaken \u201cestimate\u201d of Deere\u2019s I.Q. on the ground that there was no \u201cobjective evidence\u201d that Deere was \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d Dr. Dietz had not been told, or perhaps did not remember, that there was indeed objective evidence of mental retardation. Dr. Jones had stated in his report in 1982 that he had tested Deere\u2019s full-scale and verbal I.Q.s, and had found that Deere was borderline retarded.\n2. Deere\u2019s Evidence\nDeere\u2019s evidence at the district court evidentiary hearing consisted primarily of evaluations by four doctors \u2014 Dr. Jones, Dr. Fred Rosenthal, Dr. Armando Favaz-za, and Dr. Pablo Stewart. Two of the four doctors had personally interviewed Deere. All four of them concluded that Deere was not competent to plead guilty in 1982.\nAs noted above, Dr. Jones interviewed Deere twice in 1982, just before and just after Deere pled guilty, and prepared a contemporaneous report. Dr. Jones wrote in a 1993 declaration:\n*1170Mr. Deere ... had a compulsion to be punished with the death penalty and did not want anyone to interfere with that. Mr. Deere\u2019s insistence on pleading guilty was part of that compulsion and an outgrowth of his mental disturbances; it was irrational.... Mr. Deere was extremely self-destructive to begin with and teetered throughout his life on the edge of suicide, as evidenced most dramatically by his history of self-mutilation. ... In sum, it appeared to me that Mr. Deere was so bent on self-destruction that it disabled him from cooperating in a meaningful way with the presentation of a defense and caused him to solicit the death penalty.... Mr. Deere\u2019s personality was one of denial about his inadequacies, and his ability to correctly perceive reality was limited. It would have been naive to take Mr. Deere at face value because he was not thinking logically.\nDr. Jones concluded:\nIn my opinion, which I hold to a reasonable degree of professional certainty, Mr. Deere was not competent to aid and assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner due to his mental disabilities, which compelled him to seek death. Mr. Deere simply was not able to make logical judgments about his defense; rather, he had a compulsion to be punished with the death penalty and did not want anyone to interfere with that. Mr. Deere\u2019s insistence on pleading guilty was an irrational part of that compulsion and an outgrowth of his mental disturbances.\nDr. Jones testified in the district court to the same effect as his 1993 declaration. He emphasized that Deere had wanted someone to kill him long before the murders:\n[Deere] reported that he had asked other people to kill him before. He did not believe in suicide, but he believed it would be okay if someone else killed him.... In my view, his wanting the death penalty ... was just kind of an extreme amount of masochistic behavior and self-destruction, efforts to destroy himself. He was strongly motivated in that direction at that time.\nDr. Jones testified further \u201cthat was my conclusion, [in 1982,] that some of his acting out behavior was quite prov[o]cative towards others, and my belief was that he desired ... to be killed.\u201d Dr. Jones testified that Deere told him that he had even paid others to kill him.\nDr. Rosenthal is a board-certified psychiatrist. He examined Deere twice in December 1992 and prepared a declaration in early 1993. Dr. Rosenthal concluded that Deere was incompetent in 1982. He wrote in his declaration:\nMr. Deere purported to enter a guilty plea, but arrived at that decision under compulsion and substantial pressure from a person on whom he was extremely dependent. He was held in solitary confinement and made constantly aware of threats against his life- by persons inside and outside the jail. He was repeatedly interrogated, including three interviews by his former common-law wife, Cindy Gleason, and he was repeatedly told that he had committed the crimes and deserved to die.\nThere is substantial evidence that his thought processes were illogical and disturbed during the period of his incarceration. For example, he continued to write to Cindy Gleason, proclaiming his love for her, despite her repeated insistence that he deserved to die and was less than a man....\nIn my professional opinion, which I hold to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Mr. Deere\u2019s multiple mental impairments, exacerbated by pressures from his former girlfriend and the condi*1171tions of his confinement, rendered him incompetent to rationally comprehend his trial proceedings or to aid and assist counsel at trial. I concur in the conclusion of William Jones, Ph.D., who examined Mr. Deere at the time of his plea, and would have advised he was not competent to stand trial.\nBecause the State had not been able to examine Deere after 1982, and because there was concern that it might therefore be unfair to allow testimony about Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s 1992 examination of Deere, Dr. Rosenthal did not describe his interviews with Deere in his district-court testimony. However, Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s 1998 declaration was entered into the district-court record.\nDr. Armando Favazza is a board-certified psychiatrist. He is an expert on the psychology of people who cut themselves. Dr. Favazza reviewed Deere\u2019s personal history and records, noting Deere\u2019s troubled and violent family history, alcohol abuse, depression, and his \u201cprodigious\u201d self-mutilation. Dr. Favazza concluded that Deere was incompetent in 1982 because he possessed a \u201cpathological fixed idea that he must be killed.\u201d Dr. Favazza testified that Deere\u2019s fixed idea, formulated in early childhood\nremained with him to this very day and is a core, central, pathological idea and is preventing him from cooperating with his counsel. He just wants to die, and he\u2019s in a perfect situation right now because he can have the state kill him, and this is what he wants.\nDr. Pablo Stewart is a board-certified psychiatrist. He is also an examiner with the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, which grants board certification for psychiatrists. Dr. Stewart also reviewed Deere\u2019s personal history and records. He concluded that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder was Deere\u2019s primary condition, and that its interaction with Deere\u2019s depression, substance abuse, and possible organic brain damage rendered him incompetent. Dr. Stewart\u2019s assessment of Deere\u2019s competence matched that of Drs. Jones, Rosenthal and Favazza. He testified:\nBased on the totality of the record, it is my opinion that [Deere\u2019s] pleading guilty and wishing to be executed was not an independent decision but rather colored by, affected by[,] and was a result of his underlying psychiatric condition.\n3. District Court Decision\nIneffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of both deficient performance and prejudice. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The State does not dispute that Jones performed deficiently. It contends only that there was a lack of prejudice. Prejudice requires that there be a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that counsel\u2019s deficient performance affected the outcome of the case. The Court wrote in Strickland, \u201c[W]e believe that a defendant need not show that counsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.... The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added). See also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995); Howard v. Clark, 608 F.3d 563, 568 (9th Cir.2010).\nThe district court held that Deere established IAC by Jones. Because Dr. Jones was the only qualified professional who had performed a contemporaneous examination, the court relied most heavily on Dr. *1172Jones\u2019s conclusion. The court also relied, though less heavily, on the conclusion of Dr. Rosenthal, who examined Deere in 1992, and on the conclusions of Drs. Favaz-za and Stewart. The district court discounted Dr. Bolger\u2019s conclusion on the ground that Dr. Bolger was an unqualified evaluator who lied about his qualifications. The court considered Dr. Dietz\u2019s conclusion, but weighed it against the contrary conclusions of Drs. Jones, Rosenthal, Fa-vazza and Stewart. The court held that there was a reasonable probability that, had attorney Jones adequately developed the record in 1982, Deere would have been found incompetent to plead guilty. The court gave its reasons in a careful forty-nine-page order. I agree with the district court.\nD. Majority\u2019s Disagreement with the District Court\nThe majority disagrees with the district court. Its reasons are unconvincing.\nFirst, the majority relies heavily on Dr. Bolger\u2019s conclusion that Deere was competent. It tries mightily to make Dr. Bolger into something other than an unqualified imposter, repeatedly referring to Dr. Bol-ger as a \u201cpsychiatrist\u201d and refusing to admit that Dr. Bolger lied when he claimed in sworn testimony that he was board-certified in psychiatry. Op. at 1125-26, 1127-28 and n. 1, 1145-46. However, the parties jointly stipulated in the district court: \u201cDr. Bolger was never board certified, and his educational credentials did not qualify him for board certification.\u201d\nSecond, the majority contends that Dr. Bolger and Dr. Jones came to the same conclusions about Deere\u2019s competence in 1982. Op. at 1145-46. This is not true. As a preliminary matter, I note the obvious: Dr. Bolger\u2019s report responded to the court\u2019s question whether Deere was competent to plead guilty. Dr. Jones\u2019s 1982 report did not purport to answer that question. More fundamentally, Dr. Bol-ger\u2019s and Dr. Jones\u2019s conclusions about Deere\u2019s mental state were strikingly different. Indeed, Dr. Bolger wrote two reports, whose conclusions are themselves strikingly different.\nDr. Bolger\u2019s report to the police (which may not have been submitted to the court) contained a \u201cdiagnostic impression\u201d that Deere had, inter alia, an \u201c[ajntisocial personality type, with borderline features, not psychotic.\u201d It assessed Deere as having a \u201cdull normal\u201d \u201cintellectual capacity,\u201d and having \u201cnarrowed and constricted\u201d judgment. Dr. Bolger\u2019s report to the court described a very different mental state. Dr. Bolger stated that Deere had scored \u201cin the high percentile range\u201d on two I.Q. tests, one of which was the Wechsler Verbal I.Q. test. Dr. Bolger wrote further, \u201cJudgement as tested by verbal skills in aforementioned verbal testing is excellent. ... His I.Q. would be adjudged to be in the high range of normal.\u201d Dr. Bolger concluded: \u201cHe displays no evidence of psychosis or abnormal thinking and of course no mental illness is evident.\u201d\nDr. Jones provided a single report, based on two interviews and testing. Dr. Jones provided a more extensive discussion of Deere\u2019s background and family history than either of Dr. Bolger\u2019s reports. Unlike Dr. Bolger, who had provided only a \u201cdiagnostic impression\u201d in his first report and no \u201cdiagnosis\u201d at all in his second report, Dr. Jones provided a formal diagnosis: \u201cAdjustment disorder with depressed mood[;] Mixed substance abuse disorder, including abuse of alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, a[m]phetamines, etc.[;] Borderline personality disorder with antisocial aspects.\u201d Also unlike Dr. Bolger, who had reported in his first report that Deere had above average intelligence, Dr. Jones reported that Deere was borderline retarded.\n*1173Most important, Dr. Jones provided an analysis of Deere\u2019s mental state that was entirely lacking from either of Dr. Bolger\u2019s reports. Dr. Jones described Deere\u2019s long-standing desire to die at someone else\u2019s hand, which had led to his desire to plead guilty. Dr. Jones wrote, \u201cHe feels that suicide cannot be forgiven, but that it is permissible for someone else to kill him. Consequently, he states that he has frequently asked others to kill him and stab him. He has even paid money for this and on one occasion apparently was stabbed.\u201d Dr. Jones wrote in the last two sentences of his report: \u201cThere are self-destructive inclinations, but they are blocked from expression in suicide. Some of his acting out behavior may have been an effort to get others to kill him.\u201d\nThird, the majority relies on the observations of Judge Metheny, attorney Jones, and the prosecutor. It emphasizes that these people had opportunities to observe Deere, and that none of them concluded that he was incompetent to plead guilty. The relevant time period is 1982, so I do not discount Judge Metheny\u2019s observations on the ground that he was incompetent. But I do note that the opportunities for observation by Judge Metheny and the prosecutor were limited.\nMore important, mental illness is often not detectable by a lay person. Dr. Stewart testified that those who are mentally ill often \u201cmask\u201d symptoms, and that \u201cpeople in the criminal justice system will go to great lengths to hide the severity of mental illness where, in fact, their behavior is incompetent, but it\u2019s not seen that way cause they don\u2019t see it as mental illness.\u201d Dr. Stewart testified further that \u201cthe fact that the judge, his counsel, bailiffs[,] all these other people thought he was competent, that doesn\u2019t help me one way or the other.\u201d Dr. Rosenthal also testified that a competency determination cannot be based on a layperson\u2019s view: \u201cI don\u2019t think the layperson may pick up things that suggest there\u2019s some doubt about competency. It would be a mistake to rely on the layperson\u2019s judgment to assess whether somebody is competent or not competent.\u201d\nDeere\u2019s professional witnesses cautioned against being taken in by Deere\u2019s apparent rationality. Dr. Rosenthal testified that taking \u201cwhat the client says at face value\u201d\ncan be a real trap. Because one of the problems of not understanding much about mental illness and the way it presents is that you can get people telling you things that look very legitimate and reasonable when they\u2019re really not and the person is operating in an entirely different world from the one you\u2019re in.\nDr. Favazza agreed. He concluded that Deere tricked attorney Jones into believing that his decision was rational. Dr. Jones testified, \u201cI did not think that you could take Mr. Deere at face value. He \u2014 I don\u2019t think he used his rational thinking of doing much of anything in his life, but he would offer rationalizations after the fact at times.\u201d\nFourth, the majority contends that the facts of the crimes and the transcripts of Deere\u2019s guilty plea proceedings show that he was not \u201cout of touch with reality,\u201d and that he \u201cactually understood what was going on.\u201d Op. at 1146. The majority misses the point. Drs. Jones, Rosenthal, Fa-vazza, and Stewart did not conclude that Deere was incompetent to plead guilty based on a disconnection from reality that prevented him from understanding what was \u201cgoing on.\u201d Rather, they concluded that Deere\u2019s mental illnesses drove his strong desire to die at the hand of someone else. This desire long predated his crime, and so strongly compelled him to plead guilty that he was prevented from making a rational choice.\nFinally, the majority writes, \u201cEleven years after Deere pled guilty, habeas coun*1174sel came forward with newly-obtained opinions to the effect that Deere\u2019s plea was motivated by an irrational desire to be put to death, rendering him incompetent and his plea invalid.\u201d Op. at 1146. In disparaging what it calls \u201cthese belated opinions,\u201d the majority ignores Dr. Jones\u2019s report, prepared in 1982. Op. at 1147. Dr. Jones described in his report Deere\u2019s longstanding desire to be killed by someone else, such that seeking the death penalty would fulfill that desire. Far from being a \u201cbelated opinion,\u201d this is a contemporaneous opinion by the only qualified professional who examined Deere in 1982.\nDeere\u2019s three other professional witnesses agreed with Dr. Jones. All four witnesses testified to the same thing \u2014 that Deere suffered from mental impairments producing a compulsion to seek death at the hand of someone else, that a plea of guilty followed by execution would satisfy Deere\u2019s deep-seated and irrational need, and that Deere\u2019s compulsion prevented him from making a rational choice. In the words of Dr. Favazza, \u201cHe just wants to die, and he\u2019s in a perfect situation right now because he can have the state kill him, and this is what he wants.\u201d\nConclusion\nThere is no greater judicial responsibility than deciding whether a person shall live or die at the hands of the state. The majority makes a grievous error in holding that no hearing was required on the competence of Judge Metheny to sentence Deere to death in 1986. The majority similarly errs in holding that no hearing was required as to whether Jones was ineffective in failing to seek to disqualify Judge Metheny. Finally, the majority errs in holding that Jones did not commit ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to investigate Deere\u2019s competence to plead guilty in 1982.\nI respectfully but emphatically dissent.\n",
