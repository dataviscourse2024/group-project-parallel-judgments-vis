Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt of both robberies beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, in view of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, any error that may have been committed regarding an in-court identification procedure with respect to the gas station robbery is harmless (see, People v Bradley, 154 AD2d 609).\nThe sentence imposed is not excessive (see, People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Santucci, J. P., Luciano, Feuerstein and Adams, JJ., concur.\n",
