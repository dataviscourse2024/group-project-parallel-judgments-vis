He moved to vacate his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming his counsel\nwas ineffective by misadvising him about the immigration consequences of his guilty\nplea. The district court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. Dat\n\fappeals. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, this court reverses\nand remands.\n\n                                          I.\n\n       Dat, a South Sudanese citizen, was born in 1993 at a refugee camp in Kenya\nafter his parents fled Sudan. Admitted to the United States around 1994, he became\na lawful permanent resident. For most of his life, he lived in Omaha, Nebraska with\nhis parents and five younger siblings. His father is wheelchair-bound, and his mother,\nthe family\u2019s sole provider, works in a factory.\n\n      In 2014, Dat was indicted on two counts of Hobbs Act robbery, under 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2, and one count of brandishing a firearm during a robbery, under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2. He pled guilty to one robbery count. The other charges\nwere dismissed. The district court sentenced him to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n       In an affidavit, Dat asserts: Before pleading guilty, he asked his counsel about\nthe possibility of deportation. His counsel spoke to an immigration specialist, then\nadvised he would not be deported because he was a long-tenured lawful permanent\nresident, not an \u201cillegal immigrant.\u201d After rejecting two plea agreements with strong\ndeportation language, he accepted a plea acknowledging \u201cthere are or may be\ncollateral consequences to any conviction to include but not limited to immigration.\u201d\nHis acceptance was based on counsel\u2019s assurance his immigration status would be\nunaffected. He learned, after his conviction, this immigration advice was incorrect,\nwhen his mother\u2019s attempt to renew his green card was denied.\n\n      Dat moved to vacate his conviction under \u00a7 2255, claiming his counsel\nmisadvised him about the immigration consequences of pleading guilty. The district\ncourt denied his motion without an evidentiary hearing. In a brief order, the court\nfound he was advised of the immigration consequences by his plea agreement,\n\n                                         -2-\n\fPetition to Enter a Plea of Guilty, and colloquy with the court at his change-of-plea\nhearing. Dat appeals, arguing the district court erred in denying his motion and\nabused its discretion by not holding a hearing.\n\n                                          II.\n\n        This court reviews \u00a7 2255-ineffective-assistance claims de novo, and the\nunderlying factual findings for clear error. Hyles v. United States, 754 F.3d 530, 534\n(8th Cir. 2014). \u201cA district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing on a \u00a7 2255\nmotion may be reversed only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. To establish ineffective\nassistance during plea negotiations, \u201ca defendant must show that counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation \u2018fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u2019 and that he was\nprejudiced as a result.\u201d Jae Lee v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 1958, 1964 (2017),\nquoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). A \u00a7 2255 petitioner\nis entitled to an evidentiary hearing \u201c[u]nless the motion and the files and records of\nthe case conclusively show that the [petitioner] is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2255(b). \u201cA petitioner\u2019s allegations must be accepted as true and a hearing should\nbe held unless they are contradicted by the record, inherently incredible, merely\nconclusions, or would not entitle the petitioner to relief.\u201d Garcia v. United States,\n679 F.3d 1013, 1014 (8th Cir. 2012).\n\n                                          A.\n\n       Establishing Strickland deficiency requires showing \u201cthat counsel made errors\nso serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant\nby the Sixth Amendment.\u201d White v. Dingle, 757 F.3d 750, 752\u201353 (8th Cir. 2014),\nquoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. To provide constitutionally effective assistance,\n\u201ccriminal defense attorneys have a duty to inform clients about the possible\nimmigration consequences of pleading guilty.\u201d Barajas v. United States, 877 F.3d\n378, 380 (8th Cir. 2017), citing Padilla v. United States, 559 U.S. 356, 374 (2010).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f[W]hen the deportation consequence is truly clear, . . . the duty to give correct advice\nis equally clear.\u201d Padilla, 559 U.S. at 369.\n\n       Dat asserts his counsel assured him he would not be deported. This would be\ndeficient representation because his conviction subjects him to mandatory removal.\nHobbs Act robbery (with a 78-month term of imprisonment) is clearly an aggravated\nfelony. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (43)(F) (\u201caggravated felony\u201d means a crime of violence\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 with a term of imprisonment of at least one year, which includes\n\u201can offense that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against the person or property of another\u201d); Diaz v. United States, 863 F.3d 781,\n783 (8th Cir. 2017) (holding Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence under\nanalogous statute), citing United States v. House, 825 F.3d 381, 387 (8th Cir. 2016);\nUnited States v. Farmer, 73 F.3d 836, 842 (8th Cir. 1996) (concluding Hobbs Act\nrobbery \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst the person of another\u201d). The Immigration and Nationality Act is \u201csuccinct,\nclear, and explicit\u201d about the removal consequence for aggravated felonies. Padilla,\n559 U.S. at 368. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\u201cAny alien who is convicted of\nan aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1229b(a)(3) (an alien \u201cconvicted of any aggravated felony\u201d is not eligible for\ncancellation of removal); Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. 342, 345 (2013)\n(aggravated felony conviction subjects a lawful permanent resident to \u201cmandatory\nremoval\u201d).\n\n       Because the deportation consequence is clear, \u201cthe duty to give correct advice\nis equally clear.\u201d Padilla, 559 U.S. at 369. Taking Dat\u2019s assertions as true, his\ncounsel provided \u201cfalse assurance that his conviction would not result in his removal\nfrom this country.\u201d Id. at 368. Nothing in the record contradicts his factual\nassertions about this advice. Like in Padilla, \u201c[t]his is not a hard case in which to\nfind deficiency: The consequences of [Dat\u2019s] plea could easily be determined from\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\freading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his\ncounsel\u2019s advice was incorrect.\u201d Id. at 368\u201369.\n\n                                           B.\n\n       Prejudice is a closer question. Dat asserts he would have rejected the plea and\ninsisted on trial but for his counsel\u2019s misadvice. If true, this shows prejudice. See\nJae Lee, 137 S. Ct. at 1965 (\u201c[W]hen a defendant claims that his counsel\u2019s deficient\nperformance deprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the defendant\ncan show prejudice by demonstrating a \u2018reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\nerrors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019\u201d),\nquoting Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985). But, \u201c[c]ourts should not upset a\nplea solely because of post hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have\npleaded but for his attorney\u2019s deficiencies. Judges should instead look to\ncontemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant\u2019s expressed preferences.\u201d Id.\nat 1967. Though the record lacks evidence such as an affidavit from plea counsel or\nthe allegedly rejected plea agreements, sufficient contemporaneous evidence\nsubstantiates his claims.\n\n       Dat\u2019s background supports his assertion that he was focused on remaining in\nthe country, which the Government does not contest. Cf. Doe v. United States, 915\nF.3d 905, 912 (2d Cir. 2019) (\u201c[Defendant\u2019s] history in the United States, his family\ncircumstances, and his gainful employment all signal [his] strong connection to, and\ndesire to remain in, the United States.\u201d), citing Jae Lee, 137 S. Ct. at 1968. At the\ntime of his plea, he had lived in the United States with his family for two decades.\nAt the change-of-plea hearing, his counsel noted his request for a prison placement\nclose to his family, due to travel difficulties. There is no indication of ties to another\ncountry. True, he faced around five more years in prison from a conviction on all\ncounts at trial (if the two counts had not been dismissed per the plea agreement).\nHowever, \u201cdeportation is \u2018a particularly severe penalty,\u2019 which may be of greater\n\n                                           -5-\n\fconcern to a convicted alien than \u2018any potential jail sentence.\u2019\u201d Sessions v. Dimaya,\n138 S. Ct. 1204, 1213 (2018), quoting Jae Lee, 137 S. Ct. at 1968. At this stage,\nsufficient evidence supports his assertions of prejudice. See Jae Lee, 137 S. Ct. at\n1968\u201369 (defendant demonstrated prejudice from counsel\u2019s misadvice \u201che would not\nbe deported if he pleaded guilty\u201d where \u201cdeportation [was] the \u2018determinative issue\u2019\n. . . in plea discussions,\u201d he \u201chad strong connections to this country and no other,\u201d and\n\u201cthe consequences of taking a chance at trial were not markedly harsher than\npleading\u201d).\n\n       The Government argues that contemporaneous evidence contradicts Dat\u2019s\nassertion he would not have pled guilty if his lawyer had properly advised him. As\nthe district court noted, he acknowledged in his plea agreement that \u201cthere are or may\nbe collateral consequences to any conviction to include but not limited to\nimmigration.\u201d In his Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty, he acknowledged that a guilty\nplea in \u201cmost federal felony cases\u201d results in permanent removal. And at his\nchange-of-plea hearing, he affirmed he was aware his conviction \u201ccould affect\u201d his\nimmigration status and had discussed the matter with his attorney. However, his\ncounsel\u2019s alleged misadvice specifically undermined these equivocal warnings. They\ninformed Dat of a general possibility of immigration consequences. They do not\nnecessarily contradict or correct his counsel\u2019s alleged misadvice he would not suffer\nthose consequences in his case. Compare Doe, 915 F.3d at 913 (counsel\u2019s\nmisadvice\u2014that deportation was not a mandatory result of the guilty plea\u2014not\nremedied where judge asked if defendant understood he \u201cmay be deported\u201d and did\nnot inform him of the \u201cmandatory consequences\u201d of his plea to an aggravated felony),\nand United States v. Akinsade, 686 F.3d 248, 254 (4th Cir. 2012) (\u201cgeneral and\nequivocal admonishment\u201d that defendant\u2019s plea \u201ccould lead to deportation\u201d was\n\u201cinsufficient to correct counsel\u2019s affirmative misadvice that [defendant\u2019s] crime was\nnot categorically a deportable offense\u201d), with United States v. Fazio, 795 F.3d 421,\n428 (3d Cir. 2015) (any error in counsel\u2019s failure to inform defendant his guilty plea\nsubjected him to automatic deportation was cured by plea agreement and district\n\n                                          -6-\n\fcourt\u2019s \u201cin-depth colloquy,\u201d both of which \u201cmade clear that [defendant] was willing\nto plead guilty even if that plea would lead to automatic deportation\u201d). The record\nhere is inconclusive whether the plea documents or district court remedied counsel\u2019s\nmisadvice.\n\n        The PSR noted Dat would be subject to \u201cAdministrative Removal,\u201d and\nimmigration proceedings would commence upon his release. Dat accepted the PSR\nwithout objection; his counsel affirmed she discussed it with him. In Abraham v.\nUnited States, 699 F.3d 1050 (8th Cir. 2012), the defendant could not show prejudice\nwhen \u201cthe PSR indicated a likelihood that [the defendant] would be deported if\nconvicted; [the defendant] confirmed that he had read the PSR, discussed it with his\ncounsel, and understood it; and [the defendant] never moved to withdraw his guilty\nplea.\u201d Abraham, 699 F.3d at 1053 (alterations in original). Abraham is\ndistinguishable. There, the defendant claimed counsel failed to \u201cadvise him that the\noffense \u2018virtually ensured\u2019 deportation.\u201d Id. Because the PSR remedied any failure\nby \u201cclearly indicat[ing] his offense rendered him deportable,\u201d there was no reasonable\nprobability that the result of the proceeding would have been different if counsel had\n\u201cadvised him of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty.\u201d See id., citing\nPadilla, 559 U.S. at 366. Here, Dat asserts counsel misadvised he would not be\ndeported. The PSR does not necessarily remedy this affirmative misadvice. Relying\non counsel\u2019s advice, Dat could have reasonably believed he would not be deported\nin immigration proceedings. These assertions show an evidentiary hearing is\nrequired. See Witthar v. United States, 793 F.3d 920, 922 (8th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[T]he\ngeneral rule is that a hearing is necessary prior to the [\u00a7 2255] motion\u2019s disposition\nif a factual dispute exists.\u201d).\n\n      At sentencing, counsel noted Dat had an immigration attorney and was dealing\nwith immigration ramifications. The Government argues this shows he knew the\ndeportation risk. In United States v. Ramirez-Jimenez, 907 F.3d 1091 (8th Cir. 2018),\nan ineffective-assistance claim failed because the defendant \u201csurely knew\u201d\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdeportation was likely based on the district court\u2019s and counsel\u2019s advice at the\nchange-of-plea hearing, \u201c[c]ombined with what [the defendant] already knew from\nhis ICE custody and prior dealings with immigration officials.\u201d Ramirez-Jimenez,\n907 F.3d at 1094. Dat, however, was not in ICE custody during this case. The scope\nof his immigration attorney\u2019s representation is not in the record, let alone the advice,\nif any. He asserts his plea counsel affirmatively misadvised him, and there is a factual\ndispute whether that misadvice was remedied. Unlike in Ramirez-Jimenez, the record\nhere is inconclusive whether Dat \u201csurely knew\u201d deportation was likely.\n\n       The record does not conclusively show that Dat is entitled to no relief. The\ndistrict court thus abused its discretion by denying relief without an evidentiary\nhearing. This court remands for an evidentiary hearing on Dat\u2019s ineffective-\nassistance claim.1\n\n                                     *******\n\n      The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded for proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Dat\u2019s motion to supplement the record is denied as moot.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f",
