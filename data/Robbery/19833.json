THE STATE.\n\n\n       THOMPSON, Chief Justice.\n\n       Appellant Courtney Sales was found guilty of felony murder, armed\n\nrobbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime in\n\nconnection with the shooting death of Jamal Cooper.1 His motion for new trial\n\nin which he asserted, inter alia, that the trial court erred by commenting on the\n\nevidence in violation of OCGA \u00a7 17-8-57 was denied, and he appeals. Based\n\non our review of the record, we agree that by stating to the venire in reference\n\n\n       1\n          The crimes occurred on December 17, 2005. Appellant was indicted by a Taylor County\ngrand jury on June 12, 2006, on charges of malice murder, felony murder (two counts), armed\nrobbery, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime (two\ncounts). Following a jury trial from November 6-15, 2006, appellant was found guilty on November\n15, 2006, of felony murder based on the underlying felony of armed robbery, armed robbery and one\ncount of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. That same day appellant was\nsentenced to life for the felony murder conviction, twenty years concurrent without parole for armed\nrobbery and five years consecutive for possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.\nAppellant filed a motion for new trial on December 11, 2006 and, thereafter, filed amendments to\nhis motion on January 22, 2013, April 16, 2013, July 22, 2013 and September 10, 2013. Following\na hearing held December 27, 2013, the trial court entered an order January 16, 2014 vacating\nappellant\u2019s sentence on the armed robbery count finding this conviction had merged into his\nconviction for felony murder. See Malcolm v. State, 263 Ga. 369 (434 SE2d 479) (1993).\nThereafter, on January 21, 2014, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. Appellant\nfiled a notice of appeal on February 5, 2014 and the appeal was docketed in this Court for the\nSeptember 2014 term and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\n\fto the crimes committed that \u201c[t]his happened in Taylor County\u201d the trial court\n\nexpressed or intimated its opinion as to a disputed issue of fact at trial and\n\nviolated OCGA \u00a7 17-8-57. See Rouse v. State, __ Ga. ___ (765 SE2d 879)\n\n(2014). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n\n      1. Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, the evidence\n\npresented at trial revealed that appellant drove from New Jersey to Americus,\n\nGeorgia, with Jamal Cooper in December of 2005 to purchase cheap firearms\n\nfor resale. Appellant made arrangements for the sale through an acquaintance,\n\nKenneth Dupree. Appellant, Cooper, Dupree and three of Dupree\u2019s cousins\n\nagreed to meet an individual named \u201cSham\u201d on a dirt road to complete the\n\ntransaction. Sham never arrived. Later that night, police responded to a call\n\nfrom a gas station where they found appellant lying on the ground, shot multiple\n\ntimes. Appellant told the officers that he was involved in a transaction that went\n\nwrong and his friend, Cooper, had been shot. From appellant\u2019s description, it\n\nwas unclear whether Cooper\u2019s body was located in Taylor County. Eventually,\n\npolice found Cooper\u2019s body lying on a dirt road in south Taylor County.\n\n      Although originally confirming appellant\u2019s account, Dupree and other\n\nwitnesses eventually revealed to police that appellant made the trip from New\n\n                                        2\n\fJersey to rob Cooper because appellant believed Cooper had not given him his\n\nfair share of profits from an earlier deal. Pursuant to plea deals, members of the\n\ngroup testified that appellant shot Cooper in the back of the head then asked one\n\nof the group to take the gun and shoot appellant to make it look like he was the\n\nvictim.\n\n      We conclude the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact\n\nto find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime for which he was\n\nconvicted. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560)\n\n(1979).\n\n      2. Appellant enumerates as error three separate comments made by the\n\ntrial court during the proceedings which appellant contends violated OCGA \u00a7\n\n17-8-57. This statute provides:\n\n      [i]t is error for any judge in any criminal case, during its progress\n      or in his charge to the jury, to express or intimate his opinion as to\n      what has or has not been proved or as to the guilt of the accused.\n      Should any judge violate this Code section, the violation shall be\n      held by the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals to be error and the\n      decision in the case reversed, and a new trial granted in the court\n      below with such directions as the Supreme Court or Court of\n      Appeals may lawfully give.\n\nOCGA \u00a7 17-8-57. Given the mandatory language of the statute, \u201cany violation\n\n\n                                        3\n\fof OCGA \u00a7 17-8-57 requires a new trial regardless of whether there has been\n\nany showing of actual prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Rouse, supra, ____ Ga. at\n\n___       (citations omitted). See also Patel v. State, 282 Ga. 412, 415 (651 SE2d\n\n55) (2011). Further, appellant\u2019s failure to contemporaneously object to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s alleged violations of this statute does not preclude appellate review. See\n\nMurphy v. State, 290 Ga. 459, 461 (722 SE2d 51) (2012); State v. Gardner, 286\n\nGa. 633, 634 (690 SE2d 164) (2010).\n\n      a. Appellant first contends that the trial court violated OCGA \u00a7 17-8-57\n\nduring jury selection by improperly expressing its opinion to the venire that\n\nvenue was proper in Taylor County. Venue is a jurisdictional fact which must\n\nbe proved by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt in every criminal case.\n\nSee Patel, supra, 282 Ga. at 414. Whenever a criminal defendant pleads not\n\nguilty, he or she has challenged venue. See Jones v. State, 272 Ga. 900, 902\n\n(537 SE2d 80) (2000). Here, the record reveals that during voir dire, while\n\ninstructing prospective jurors to consider whether they might have heard\n\nsomething about the case or know any of the parties involved, the trial court\n\nstated:\n\n      This happened in Taylor County. So if anybody knows any of the\n\n                                          4\n\f      parties, we would respectfully ask you to let us know now.\n\nWe find that this statement made by the trial court clearly, unambiguously and\n\nerroneously suggested to jurors that venue in Taylor County had been\n\nestablished or was not in dispute in this case.\n\n      In a case with facts virtually identical to those presented here, this Court\n\nrecently observed:\n\n      [W]hen . . . a trial judge makes a statement to jurors, however\n      inadvertent or unintentional, informing them that a crime occurred\n      in a particular county, i.e., a particular venue, the making of the\n      statement violates \u00a7 17-8-57 because it could be construed as a\n      comment regarding a required element of the State\u2019s case.\n\nRouse, supra, ___ Ga. at ___. In Rouse, the trial court stated, \u201cyou will be\n\nhearing about a case . . . that happened in Muscogee County,\u201d while giving\n\npreliminary instructions to the venire. Id. at ___. Finding it \u201cbeyond dispute\n\nthat voir dire is part of the \u2018progress\u2019 of a case,\u201d we held that this comment\n\nviolated OCGA \u00a7 17-8-57 because it \u201caffirmatively establish[ed] a disputed\n\nelement which the state [had] the burden of proving at trial.\u201d Id. at ___.\n\nMoreover, this Court concluded it could not \u201csurmise whether [the Rouse\n\ncourt\u2019s comment] may have caused actual prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Id. at\n\n___, citing Murphy v. State, 290 Ga. 459, 461 (722 SE2d 51) (2012) (trial\n\n                                        5\n\fcourt\u2019s comments about witness violated OCGA \u00a7 17-8-57 because it is\n\nimpossible to determine that jurors were not influenced).\n\n         We find no discernable differences between the trial court\u2019s statement in\n\nRouse and the statement at issue in this case. Considered in context, neither\n\nstatement could reasonably be construed as a mere comment on the evidence\n\njurors could expect to hear or as a comment on what the State was expected to\n\nprove at trial. Accordingly, we conclude that by stating to the venire in this case\n\nthat the crime happened in Taylor county, the trial court \u201cexpressed or intimated\n\nthe court\u2019s opinion as to a disputed issue of fact\u201d and thus violated OCGA \u00a7 17-\n\n8-57. Rouse, supra, ____ at ___. Accordingly, appellant must be granted a new\n\ntrial.\n\n         b. Having determined that appellant is entitled to a new trial, we need not\n\naddress appellant\u2019s claims alleging additional comments by the trial court\n\nviolated OCGA \u00a7 17-8-57 as such matters are not likely to recur on retrial. See\n\nPatel, supra at 416; Willingham v. State, 279 Ga. 886, 889 (622 SE2d 343)\n\n(2005).\n\n         Judgment reversed.      All the Justices concur, except Nahmias and\n\nBlackwell, JJ., who concur in the judgment only.\n\n                                          6\n\f7\n\f",
