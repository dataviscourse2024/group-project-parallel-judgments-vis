            "opinion_text": "\nFletcher Justice\nIn Christenson v. State, 261 Ga. 80 (402 SE2d 41) (1991), we affirmed Christenson\u2019s conviction for murder and armed robbery, but remanded the case to the trial court for further hearing on two penalty-phase issues in this death-penalty case. Specifically, we directed the court on remand to determine (1) whether the district attorney\u2019s questions to the defendant\u2019s character witnesses were based on reliable information supported by admissible evidence, and (2) whether the defendant\u2019s confession to an extrinsic crime was voluntary and admissible in this case. Id. at 90-92.\nOn remand, the court conducted the required hearing and set forth its detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a 19-page order.\n1. The proceedings on remand afforded the defendant a full and fair opportunity to address the issues contemplated by our remand.\n2. The record supports the findings of the remand court and its conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s sentencing-phase witnesses was proper and that the defendant\u2019s confession to an extrinsic crime was properly admitted in evidence in this case.\n3. As we held previously, the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the offense of murder was committed during the commission of armed robbery. OCGA \u00a7 17-10-30 (b) (2). Now that we have the benefit of the proceedings on remand, we find that Christenson\u2019s death sentence was not imposed as the result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. OCGA \u00a7 17-10-35 (c) (1). His death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate to penalties imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. OCGA \u00a7 17-10-35 (c) (3). The similar cases listed in the Appendix support the imposition of a death sentence in this case.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\n\nAll the Justices concur, except Benham, J., who dissents.\n\n",
