CARLA MOTEN\n\n                  Direct Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County\n                     Nos. 98-06935, 98-06936 Arthur T. Bennett, Judge\n\n\n\n                  No. W2001-01922-CCA-R3-CD - Filed November 22, 2002\n\n\nDefendant, Carla Moten, was indicted by the Shelby County Grand Jury for aggravated burglary and\nintentional aggravated assault. Defendant was convicted by a jury of the lesser-included offense of\nreckless aggravated assault. The jury also found Defendant guilty of aggravated criminal trespass\nas a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary. Defendant was sentenced to two years for her\nreckless aggravated assault conviction and six months for her aggravated criminal trespass\nconviction, to be served concurrently. In her appeal as of right, Defendant argues that the evidence\nat trial was insufficient to support her conviction for reckless aggravated assault. We disagree, and\naffirm the judgment of the trial court regarding the conviction for reckless aggravated assault.\nHowever, we find plain error in the conviction for aggravated criminal trespass as a lesser-included\noffense of aggravated burglary and therefore reverse and dismiss the conviction for aggravated\ncriminal trespass.\n\n                         Tenn.

Facts\n\n        On October 26, 1997, Crystal Moore was at the home of Thomas Jones, whom she was\ndating at the time. Moore testified that around midnight, she was looking out the front door when\nshe saw the Defendant across the street at Moore\u2019s aunt\u2019s house. Moore assumed that Defendant\nwas looking for her, so she stuck her head outside the door to let Defendant see that she was there.\nDefendant then came across the street to Jones\u2019 house. Moore testified that Defendant had called\nJones earlier that night. Moore had then asked Jones to take her home before Defendant got to his\nhouse. Jones told her that he was too intoxicated to do so, having drunk a half of a pint of bourbon\nthat night.\n\n        As Moore observed Defendant cross the street and approach Jones\u2019 house, Jones came to the\ndoor and slammed the door on Defendant. He then pushed Moore onto the floor and picked up the\nphone to call the police. Defendant broke the window beside the front door and dove through the\nbroken window. Moore testified that she got up from the floor and ran to the bathroom. She tried\nto hold the bathroom door closed, but Defendant pushed it open. Moore shoved Defendant and ran\noutside the house. Defendant ran behind her, chasing her up and down the street, saying, \u201cYou took\nmy man.\u201d Moore was running from Defendant, yelling, \u201cGet her off of me.\u201d Defendant picked up\na broken bottle from the street and cut Moore with it while chasing her.\n\n        Moore saw Jones, who had already called the police, backing out of the driveway in his car.\nShe ran over to Jones\u2019 car and tried to get inside it, but Defendant was holding onto her shirt and\ntrying to climb into the car with her. The two women struggled for a while. Then Moore ran across\nthe street to her aunt\u2019s house. Defendant continued to chase her across the street. Moore testified\nthat she was trying to get help from her aunt when she saw the police coming. The police arrived,\nand Moore ran over to police and tried to get into the back seat of the police car to get away from\nDefendant. Moore was taken to the hospital, where she received stitches for lacerations to her neck\nand arm.\n\nII. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n        The sole issue raised by Defendant on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to\nsupport her conviction for reckless aggravated assault. When an accused challenges the sufficiency\nof the convicting evidence, we must determine whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found\nthe essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Keough, 18 S.W.3d 175,\n180-81 (Tenn. 2000) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)). In so determining,\nthis Court must review the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, affording it the\nstrongest legitimate view of the evidence in the record as well as all reasonable and legitimate\ninferences which may be drawn from the evidence. Keough, 18 S.W.3d at 181 (citing State v. Bland,\n958 S.W.2d 651, 659 (Tenn. 1997)). Questions regarding the credibility of the witnesses, the weight\nto be given the evidence, and any factual issues raised by the evidence are resolved by the trier of\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\ffact, not this Court. Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 659. Furthermore, a guilty verdict replaces the\npresumption of innocence with a presumption of guilt, which defendant has the burden of\novercoming on appeal. State v. Grace, 493 S.W.2d 474, 476 (Tenn. 1973).\n\n        A conviction for reckless aggravated assault requires proof that a defendant recklessly\ncommits an assault, as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(1), and causes serious bodily\ninjury to the victim, or uses or displays a deadly weapon. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-102(a)(2). A\ndeadly weapon is defined as \u201c[a]nything...capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Tenn.\nCode Ann. \u00a7 39-11-106(a)(5)(B). Defendant contends that the only evidence that Defendant caused\nbodily injury to Moore with the use of a deadly weapon was the testimony of Moore herself, which\nthe Defendant argues is self-serving and cannot be believed because Jones\u2019 testimony conflicts with\ntestimony of Moore, the victim. The trier of fact determines issues of witness credibility and is\nafforded all inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence. State v. Cabbage, 571 S.W.2d 832, 832\n(Tenn. 1978). Furthermore, conflicts in trial testimony are resolved in favor of the jury verdict.\nTuggle, 639 S.W.2d at 914.\n\n         Moore testified that Defendant chased her into the street, picked up a broken bottle, and\nattacked her with it. The evidence shows that Moore suffered lacerations to her neck and arm. Jones\ntestified that he did not remember seeing either Moore or the Defendant with a weapon that night.\nThat Jones does not remember seeing either the victim or the Defendant in possession of a weapon,\nor that certain parts of his testimony conflict with parts of Moore\u2019s testimony, is not a sufficient basis\nupon which to conclude that the evidence does not support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. The jury accredited the testimony of the victim in this case. Defendant is not entitled to relief\non this issue.\n\nIII. Plain Error - Conviction of Aggravated Criminal Trespass\n\n                An error which has affected the substantial right of a defendant may be noticed at any\ntime in the discretion of the appellate court where necessary to do substantial justice. State v. Taylor,\n992 S.W.2d 941, 944 (Tenn. 1999). \u201cPlain error\u201d or \u201cfundamental error\u201d is recognized under Tenn.\nR. Crim. P. 52(b). State v. Adkisson, 899 S.W.2d 626, 639 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). Some errors\nare so fundamental and pervasive that they require reversal without regard to the facts or\ncircumstances of the particular case. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S. Ct. 1431,\n1436, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986).\n\n        There are five factors which must be present for a court to determine \u201cplain error\u201d exists:\n               (a) the record must clearly establish what occurred in the trial court;\n               (b) a clear and unequivocal rule of law must have been breached;\n               (c) a substantial right of the accused must have been adversely affected;\n               (d) the accused did not waive the issue for tactical reasons; and\n               (e) consideration of the error is \u201cnecessary to do substantial justice.\u201d\n\nState v. Smith, 24 S.W.3d 274, 282 (Tenn. 2000) (citing Adkisson, 899 S.W.2d at 641-42).\n\n\n                                                   -3-\n\f        This Court held, in State v. Townes, 56 S.W.3d 30 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000), pursuant to the\n\u201cstatutory elements approach\u201d of State v. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453, 464 (Tenn. 1999), that \u201ccriminal\ntrespass cannot be a lesser-included offense of burglary.\u201d Townes, 56 S.W.3d at 39.\n\n         Subsequent opinions of this Court, which are unpublished, have held that criminal trespass\nis a lesser-included offense of burglary. See State v. George Redd, 2001 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS\n631, No. W2000-01620-CCA-R3-CD (Tenn. Crim. App., filed Aug. 9, 2001 at Jackson), perm. to\nappeal denied March 4, 2002 (Tenn. 2002); State v. Mickey G. White, 2002 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS\n321, No. W2001-02429-CCA-R3-CD (Tenn. Crim. App., filed April 12, 2002 at Jackson), no app.\nfor perm. to appeal filed.\n\n        However, in State v. Reginald D. Terry, 2002 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 749, No. W2001-\n03027-CCA-RM-CD (Tenn Crim. App., filed Aug. 27, 2002 at Jackson), perm. to appeal filed Oct.\n29, 2002, a panel of this Court noted the split in authority on this issue, but followed the holding in\nthe published opinion of State v. Townes, following the requirement of Tennessee Supreme Court\nRule 4(H)(2) that \u201copinions reported in the official reporter, however, shall be considered controlling\nauthority for all purposes, until such opinion is reversed or modified by a court of competent\njurisdiction.\u201d The court in Terry, supra, explicitly held that aggravated criminal trespass is not a\nlesser-included offense of aggravated burglary. As noted by our court in State v. Reginald D. Terry,\nthe opinions inconsistent with Townes did not mention the court\u2019s holding in Townes. Therefore,\nwe respectfully conclude that Townes has not been reversed or modified. Having come to that\nconclusion, we agree with the panel of this court in Terry that the opinion in Townes must be\nfollowed. Accordingly, since aggravated criminal trespass is not a lesser-included offense of\naggravated burglary, Defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated criminal trespass must be reversed and\ndismissed.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court as to the conviction for reckless\naggravated assault is affirmed. The conviction for aggravated criminal trespass is reversed and\ndismissed.\n\n                                                       ___________________________________\n                                                       THOMAS T.
