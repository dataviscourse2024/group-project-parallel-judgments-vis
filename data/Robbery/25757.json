I respectfully\n\ndissent. For the reasons set forth below, I would grant the application and reinstate the\n\ntrial court\u2019s order lifting the automatic supersedeas.\n\n       In this case, police officers executed a search warrant on Applicant\u2019s jewelry\n\nstores. The warrant specified that only the jewelry that was \u201cidentifiable\u201d as being the\n\nsubject of ongoing burglary investigations was to be seized.          See Trial Ct. Op.,\n\n8/4/2017, at 2.    The Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence later demonstrated that only\n\napproximately 2% of the jewelry that was seized was connected to any crime. Id. at 2\n\n(noting that, of approximately 50,000 items seized, \u201conly 1,000 pieces were \u2018identifiable\u2019\n\nas part of a crime\u201d), 16 (\u201c48,093 pieces [were] not identified as being part of a crime\u201d).\n\nNonetheless, police officers seized Applicant\u2019s entire inventory. Id. at 1-2. The origin of\n\nsome of the inventory could not be ascertained, but the trial court specifically credited\n\ntestimonial and documentary evidence demonstrating that \u201c95% of the inventory\n\fconfiscated by the Commonwealth [was] bought from wholesalers and, therefore, was\n\nlegitimate and not proceeds of a crime.\u201d        Id. at 9-10.    The trial court\u2019s finding\n\nnotwithstanding, the Commonwealth has retained Applicant\u2019s property, and has\n\ncontinued to operate a website upon which it advertised and posted photographs of all\n\nof Applicant\u2019s inventory, inviting members of the public to claim any items that belong to\n\nthem.1 Id. at 12.\n\n      Applicant filed a petition for the return of property.     The trial court granted\n\nApplicant\u2019s petition, and ordered the Commonwealth to return the pieces of jewelry that\n\nwere unconnected to any crime, while allowing the Commonwealth to retain the pieces\n\nthat served as evidence of a criminal enterprise.      To minimize any possibility that\n\nApplicant irretrievably would dissipate jewelry later determined to be connected to the\n\ncrimes under investigation, the trial court ordered Applicant to photograph every item\n\nsubsequently sold, to keep receipts with those photographs, and to record the sale\n\nprice, method of payment, and every buyer\u2019s name, address, and telephone number.\n\n      The Commonwealth appealed the trial court\u2019s order granting Applicant\u2019s petition\n\nin part, thereby effecting an automatic supersedeas and staying the trial court\u2019s order\n\npending the resolution of its appeal.    See Pa.R.A.P. 1736. The trial court granted\n\nApplicant\u2019s motion to lift the stay. The Comonwealth sought emergency relief in the\n\nSuperior Court. The Superior Court reinstated the supersedeas through a per curiam\n\norder, providing no explanation for its rejection of the trial court\u2019s reasoning.     The\n\nSuperior Court\u2019s determination on the merits is pending.        Although that court has\n\ndirected expedited consideration, Applicant remains unable to access the inventory that\n\n\n\n\n1\n      http://montcopa.org/JewelryWebsite (last visited August 18, 2017).\n\n\n\n                                    [85 EM 2017] - 2\n\fthe trial court determined to be legitimate and wholly unconnected to any crime.\n\nConsequently, Applicant is unable to conduct any lawful business operations.\n\n        In my view, the Superior Court\u2019s order reinstating the supersedeas and\n\npreventing Applicant\u2019s recovery of its lawfully-owned property reflects an \u201cegregious\n\nerror\u201d that warrants the exercise of this Court\u2019s supervisory powers. See Pa.R.A.P.\n\n3315, Note (providing for this Court\u2019s review of stay orders of appellate courts). The\n\ntrial court aptly determined that Applicant has made a sufficient demonstration that: (1)\n\nit is likely to prevail on the merits, (2) it will suffer irreparable injury if the requested relief\n\nis not granted, (3) lifting the supersedeas will not substantially harm the Commonwealth\n\nor other interested parties, and (4) lifting the supersedeas will not adversely affect the\n\npublic interest. See Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n v. Process Gas Consumers Grp., 467 A.2d\n\n805, 808-09 (Pa. 1983) (identifying the criteria for grant of a stay, and considering them\n\nin context of a motion to vacate an order granting a stay). I would exercise this Court\u2019s\n\nextraordinary jurisdiction, which is necessary here to \u201ccause right and justice to be\n\ndone.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726.\n\n        Applicant notes that, having already prevailed on the merits before the trial court\n\nwith regard to the thousands of items that the trial court determined to have been\n\nobtained legitimately, it has made a sufficient showing that it was \u201centitled to lawful\n\npossession thereof,\u201d so as to establish grounds for the return of its property under\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 588.2 Applicant observes that, once it preliminarily established its\n\n2\n        Rule 588 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant\npart:\n        (A) A person aggrieved by a search and seizure, whether or not executed\n        pursuant to a warrant, may move for the return of the property on the\n        ground that he or she is entitled to lawful possession thereof. . . .\n       (B) The judge hearing such motion shall receive evidence on any issue of\n       fact necessary to the decision thereon. If the motion is granted, the\n(continued\u2026)\n\n                                        [85 EM 2017] - 3\n\fentitlement to the lawfully-owned property, the burden fell upon the Commonwealth to\n\ndemonstrate that the property was derivative contraband, necessitating proof of a\n\nspecific nexus between the property and the crimes alleged.             See Emergency\n\nApplication at 19-20 (citing, inter alia, Barron v. Commonwealth, 74 A.3d 250, 255 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2013), and Petition of Koenig, 663 A.2d 725, 726 (Pa. Super. 1995)).\n\n        Applicant notes that the Commonwealth had months to acquire evidence\n\nsufficient to satisfy its burden, and that the trial court granted the Commonwealth\n\nnumerous extensions of time to produce such evidence. Despite the time afforded to\n\nthe Commonwealth, and despite the Commonwealth\u2019s invitation to the public to claim\n\nApplicant\u2019s inventory as stolen property, \u201cthe Commonwealth did not provide any direct\n\nor circumstantial evidence that the property which [Applicant] wanted returned was, in\n\nfact, derivative contraband.\u201d      Trial Ct. Op. at 12 (emphasis in original).   Applicant\n\nhighlights the Commonwealth\u2019s concession that some percentage of the property seized\n\nwas not evidence of a crime, and that the Commonwealth, therefore, had no entitlement\n\nto it. See Emergency Application at 12-13 (quoting Notes of Testimony, 5/26/2017, at\n\n161) (statement of the Commonwealth that \u201cwe have never [\u2014] not once [\u2014] walked\n\ninto this courtroom and said every single item in there [i]s stolen. God knows that some\n\nof this is not stolen . . . .\u201d).\n\n        Importantly, the trial court only ordered the return of the inventory for which no\n\nnexus of a crime had been established, allowing the Commonwealth to retain the pieces\n\nof jewelry that would serve as actual evidence of a crime. There is no legal theory that\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\n     property shall be restored unless the court determines that such property\n     is contraband, in which case the court may order the property to be\n     forfeited.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 588(A)-(B).\n\n\n\n                                       [85 EM 2017] - 4\n\fwould allow the Commonwealth to retain indefinitely property that is lawfully owned and\n\nunconnected to any crime. The delineation between the property that was possessed\n\nunlawfully and the property that was obtained legitimately was based upon the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, which are owed substantial\n\ndeference on appeal.       For these reasons alone, Applicant has demonstrated a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits.3\n\n       Applicant has established that it will suffer irreparable injury if it cannot reacquire\n\nits lawfully-owned inventory. The trial court noted that, subsequent to the seizure of\n\nApplicant\u2019s inventory, Citizens Bank has sought to collect a $100,000.00 loan that was\n\nsecured by the inventory. Trial Ct. Op. at 14.4     Applicant cannot repay the loan due to\n\nthe seizure, and has borrowed money from more than nine friends and relatives in an\n\nattempt to prevent Citizens Bank from seeking to acquire from the Commonwealth the\n\njewelry serving as collateral and then proceeding to liquidate it for less than its fair\n\nmarket value. Id. at 15. Apart from Applicant\u2019s difficulties with the loan, Applicant is\n\n3\n        The Commonwealth also appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to transfer\nvenue of Applicant\u2019s petition for return of property. The venue issue is pending before\nthe Superior Court. Applicant does not address the venue issue in the instant\napplication for emergency relief. Arguably, this omission could serve as a basis to\nconclude that Applicant has not established a \u201clikelihood of success on the merits.\u201d But\nI would not deny the Emergency Application upon these grounds.                 First, the\nCommonwealth\u2019s argument makes no mention of its challenge to the trial court\u2019s venue\nruling, and the Commonwealth does not suggest it as a basis for this Court to deny\nrelief to Applicant. More importantly, the venue issue is wholly independent from the\nmerits of the issue upon which Applicant sought relief. Nowhere is it suggested that the\nruling upon the substantive issue would have been different had the same evidence\nbeen presented to a trial court in Montgomery County instead of Philadelphia County.\n4\n      Again highlighting the legitimacy of much of Applicant\u2019s inventory, the trial court\nnoted that the jewelry that served as collateral for the Citizens Bank loan was\npurchased lawfully from jewelry wholesalers, and that Applicant produced\n\u201cdocumentation showing purchases of their inventory from Alpha Gem Corp., Mehdioff\nDiamond Dealers Trading Company, Diamond Castle, Inc., New York Diamond\nExchange, Inc., and many others too numerous to list.\u201d Trial Ct. Op. at 10-11.\n\n\n\n                                     [85 EM 2017] - 5\n\fwithout inventory and cannot conduct business operations.         The trial court credited\n\nevidence showing that the owners of DUA were three months behind in paying their\n\nhome mortgage, and that foreclosure proceedings were imminent. Id. The trial court\n\ncredited evidence that Applicant has lost existing customers and prospective new\n\ncustomers because its stores are closed and empty, causing Applicant\u2019s business\n\n\u201cimmeasurable harm.\u201d Id. The trial court credited evidence that Applicant is many\n\nmonths behind on paying its rent for the commercial leases for all of its storefronts, and\n\nthat \u201ceviction will be certain.\u201d Id. The trial court credited evidence that the owners of\n\nDUA have three children and now cannot afford to purchase groceries for their family.\n\nId. at 16.\n\n       The trial court noted that Applicant likely would not be able to recoup any\n\neconomic losses from the Commonwealth because, if Applicant later seeks to bring an\n\naction for damages, \u201cit would likely be blocked by immunity provisions applicable to\n\ngovernmental entities.\u201d Id. at 17. This appears to be correct. But let us assume for the\n\nsake of argument that Applicant later could somehow recover damages from the\n\nCommonwealth. The harm to Applicant still could not be undone. By that time, it likely\n\nwould be out of business permanently. Its owners may have faced foreclosure and lost\n\ntheir family home. Financial and reputational ruin of this sort is not easily remedied by a\n\npotential award of damages that might or might not arrive years in the future. And that\n\nis assuming, merely arguendo, Applicant\u2019s best-case scenario of being able to pursue\n\nsuch a claim at some later date, as opposed to the more likely eventuality that the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s immunity would operate to deny Applicant any recourse whatsoever,\n\nas the trial court postulated. As such, Applicant has established that it faces immediate,\n\nirreparable harm if it cannot reacquire its lawfully-owned inventory and return to\n\nconducting its business operations.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [85 EM 2017] - 6\n\f       In addition to the clear financial harm resulting from the Commonwealth\u2019s\n\nretention of Applicant\u2019s inventory, the trial court noted that Applicant is being injured by\n\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s website, inasmuch as \u201cthe Commonwealth is distributing\n\n[Applicant\u2019s] inventory to the public, some of whom are not the rightful owners.\u201d Id. The\n\ntrial court \u201cheard evidence directly from the Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s\n\nOffice\u201d that nine people had claimed jewelry from the website, only later to return it,\n\nstating that they were not the rightful owners of the items. Id. Perhaps somewhat\n\nironically, given that Applicant is alleged to have distributed property of which it was not\n\nthe rightful owner, Applicant\u2019s \u201cinventory is being distributed to other than their rightful\n\nowners, which is obviously harming\u201d Applicant. Id.\n\n       With regard to potential harm to the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to prosecute the\n\ncrimes alleged, Applicant notes that the only property sought to be returned is the\n\nproperty determined to be unrelated to criminal activity. It remains undisputed that the\n\nCommonwealth may retain possession of the jewelry determined to be \u201cevidence\u201d of the\n\nalleged offenses. Applicant notes that the lawfully-obtained inventory \u201cis not \u2018evidence,\u2019\n\nand very likely never will be.\u201d Emergency Application at 27. The trial court noted that\n\nApplicant \u201cis not seeking return of any items/jewelry [that] the Commonwealth is using to\n\nprosecute\u201d the participants in the alleged burglary ring. Trial Ct. Op. at 18. Regardless,\n\nin an abundance of caution, the trial court imposed the above-referenced conditions\n\nupon Applicant, in order to protect against the irretrievable loss of inventory in the event\n\nthat some items later might be determined to be connected to the offenses at issue.\n\nThe trial court further noted that, in setting up its website, the Commonwealth already\n\nhas photographed and catalogued every piece of jewelry seized.                    \u201cTherefore,\n\nprophylactically,   the Commonwealth       already has what        [it] need[s]    regarding\n\nphotographs and catalogued information to be able to continue to pursue [Applicant]\n\n\n\n\n                                     [85 EM 2017] - 7\n\fshould anyone else ever come forward to make additional claims.\u201d             Id.   Under the\n\ncircumstances, the Commonwealth will suffer no material prejudice by returning\n\nApplicant\u2019s lawfully-obtained inventory during the pendency of its appeal.\n\n       Applicant argues that the public interest favors returning Applicant\u2019s lawfully-\n\nowned property and discouraging the \u201cabuse and overreach\u201d in which the\n\nCommonwealth has engaged. Emergency Application at 30. Reiterating the lack of\n\nharm to the Commonwealth, Applicant again asserts that, under the circumstances of\n\nthe instant case, the \u201cpublic interest in protecting criminal prosecutions simply will not be\n\ncompromised by the return of the inventory.\u201d Id. The trial court agreed with Applicant\n\nthat the Commonwealth relied upon an impermissible expansion of the parameters of\n\nthe search warrant, and that seizing and retaining all of Applicant\u2019s inventory, rather\n\nthan the just the items for which probable cause was established, \u201coffends the basic\n\nnotions of due process at the heart of our jurisprudence.\u201d Trial Ct. Op. at 14. I agree\n\nwholeheartedly (or whole-mindedly) with the trial court\u2019s observation.\n\n       In essence, the police officers treated the search warrant as a general warrant.\n\nSo armed, they deemed themselves authorized simply to seize all items possibly\n\nconnected to a crime, regardless of whether probable cause existed for any individual\n\nitem or whether the warrant specified the items to be seized with the requisite degree of\n\nparticularity.\n\n       Our search and seizure jurisprudence does not countenance such a haphazard,\n\nscattershot approach. Our Constitutions do not allow for items to be seized first and\n\nprobable cause to be established second. Little difference may be found between the\n\nexecution of the search warrant in the instant case and the operation of the infamous\n\n\u201cwrits of assistance\u201d in Colonial America, the abuses of which helped inspire the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [85 EM 2017] - 8\n\fFramers to draft the Fourth Amendment and to include within it an essential and explicit\n\nparticularity requirement.5 This is a basic, bedrock principle of our law.\n\n       The proprietor of Applicant\u2019s businesses, Wasim Shazad, may very well be\n\nproven guilty of any number of criminal offenses. Let us assume for the moment that he\n\nis convicted. It has nonetheless remained undisputed by the parties throughout these\n\nproceedings that some substantial percentage of Applicant\u2019s inventory is part of\n\nApplicant\u2019s completely legitimate business operations. In its role as finder of fact, the\n\ntrial court assessed the evidence, rendered its credibility determinations, and quantified\n\nthe property that is not connected to a crime and is of no use to the Commonwealth\u2019s\n\nprosecutorial efforts. No public interest is served in allowing the Commonwealth to\n\nretain private property to which it has no entitlement. Applicant persuasively avers that\n\n\u201cit is in the public\u2019s interest to prevent overzealous government agents from making\n\nsuch a sweeping seizure and retaining private property indefinitely without any legal\n\nbasis.\u201d Emergency Application at 30.\n\n       The Commonwealth certainly is entitled to its appeal in the Superior Court.\n\nHowever, the same appellate process that is designed to facilitate the dispensing of\n\njustice is here operating to deny it. The automatic supersedeas mechanism that attends\n\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is causing irreparable harm to a business and to the adults\n\n\n5\n       See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 608 (1980) (\u201c[I]t was the abusive use of\nthe warrant power . . . that precipitated the Fourth Amendment. That Amendment grew\nout of colonial opposition to the infamous general warrants known as writs of\nassistance, which empowered customs officers to search at will, and to break open\nreceptacles or packages, wherever they suspected uncustomed goods to be.\u201d);\nStanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 485 (1965) (quoting Marron v. United States, 275 U.S.\n192, 196 (1927)) (\u201cThe requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to\nbe seized makes general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of\none thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is left\nto the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                     [85 EM 2017] - 9\n\fand children who rely upon that business. The Commonwealth already has taken steps\n\nto minimize any harm that may arise from lifting the supersedeas, and the trial court\n\ntailored its order to further mitigate any potential prejudice to the ongoing criminal\n\nproceedings. Because Applicant has established its likelihood of success on the merits,\n\nthe severe and irreparable harm that it faces, the lack of harm to the Commonwealth,\n\nand the public interests that its requested relief would serve, I would grant Applicant\u2019s\n\nEmergency Application and would reinstate the trial court\u2019s order lifting the automatic\n\nsupersedeas.     The Superior Court\u2019s error in dismissing the above-discussed\n\nconsiderations requires intervention in our extraordinary jurisdiction to \u201ccause right and\n\njustice to be done.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726.\n\n      I respectfully dissent.\n\n      Justice Donohue joins the dissenting statement.\n\n\n\n\n                                   [85 EM 2017] - 10\n\f",

            "opinion_text": "\nJUSTICE WECHT,\nDissenting\nToday, this Court denies the emergency application for relief filed by DUA Diamonds, Inc., (\u201cDUA\u201d) and Jasmeen Kaur (collectively, \u201cApplicant\u201d). I respectfully dissent. For the reasons set forth below, I would grant the application and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order lifting the automatic supersedeas,\nIn this case, police officers executed a search warrant on Applicant\u2019s jewelry stores. The warrant specified that only the jewelry that was \u201cidentifiable\u201d as being the subject of ongoing burglary investigations was to be seized. See Trial Ct. Op.; 8/4/2017, at 2. The Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence later demonstrated that only approximately 2% of the jewelry that was seized was connected to any crime. Id. at 2 (noting that, of approximately 50,000 items seized, \u201conly 1,000 pieces were \u2018identifiable\u2019 as part of a crime\u201d), 16 (\u201c48,093 pieces [were] not identified as being part of a crime\u201d). Nonetheless, police officers seized Applicant\u2019s entire inventory. Id. at 1-2. The origin of some of the inventory could, not be ascertained, but the trial court specifically credited testimonial and documentary evidence demonstrating that \u201c95% of the inventory confiscated by the Commonwealth [was] bought from wholesalers and, therefore, was legitimate and not proceeds of a crime.\u201d Id. at 9-10. The trial court\u2019s finding notwithstanding, the Commonwealth has retained Applicant\u2019s property, and has continued to operate a website upon which it advertised and posted photographs of all of Applicant\u2019s inventory, inviting members of the public to claim any items that belong to them.1 Id. at 12.\nApplicant filed a petition for the return of property. The trial court granted Applicant\u2019s petition, and ordered the Commonwealth to return the pieces of jewelry that were unconnected to any crime, while allowing the Commonwealth to retain the pieces that served as evidence of a criminal enterprise. .To minimize any possibility that Applicant irretrievably would dissipate jewelry later determined to be connected to the crimes under investigation, the trial court ordered Applicant to photograph every item subsequently sold, to keep receipts with those photographs, and *1000to record the sale price, method of payment, and every buyer\u2019s name, address, and telephone number.\nThe Commonwealth appealed the trial court\u2019s order granting Applicant\u2019s petition in part, thereby effecting an automatic su-persedeas and staying the trial court\u2019s order pending the resolution of its appeal. See Pa.R.A.P. 1736. The trial court granted Applicant\u2019s motion to lift the stay. The Commonwealth sought emergency relief in the Superior Court. The Superior Court reinstated the supersedeas through a per curiam order, providing no explanation for its rejection of the trial court\u2019s reasoning. The Superior Court\u2019s determination on the merits is pending. Although that court has directed expedited consideration, Applicant remains unable to access the inventory that the trial court determined to be legitimate and wholly unconnected to any crime. Consequently, Applicant is unable to conduct any lawful business operations.\nIn my view, the Superior Court\u2019s order reinstating the supersedeas and preventing Applicant\u2019s recovery of its lawfully-owned property reflects an \u201cegregious error\u201d that warrants the exercise of this Court\u2019s supervisory powers. See Pa.R.A.P. 3315, Note (providing for this Court\u2019s review of stay orders of appellate courts). The trial court aptly determined that Applicant has made a sufficient demonstration that: (1) it is likely to prevail on the merits, (2) it will suffer irreparable injury if the requested relief is not granted, (3) lifting the supersedeas will not substantially harm the Commonwealth or other interested parties, and (4) lifting the supersedeas will not adversely affect the public interest. See Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n v. Process Gas Consumers Grp., 502 Pa. 545, 467 A.2d 805, 808-09 (1983) (identifying the criteria for grant of a stay, and considering them in context of a motion to vacate an order granting a stay). I would exercise this Court\u2019s extraordinary jurisdiction, which is necessary here to \u201ccause right and justice to be done.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726.\nApplicant notes that, having already prevailed on the merits before the trial court with regard to the thousands of items that the trial court determined to have been obtained legitimately, it has made a sufficient showing that it was \u201centitled to lawful possession thereof,\u201d so as to establish grounds for the return of its property under Pa.R.Crim.P. 588.2 Applicant observes that, once it preliminarily established its entitlement to the lawfully-owned property, the burden fell upon the Commonwealth to demonstrate that the property was derivative contraband, necessitating proof of a specific nexus between the property and the crimes alleged. See Emergency Application at 19-20 (citing, inter alia, Barren v. Commonwealth, 74 A.3d 250, 255 (Pa. Super. 2013), and Petition of Koenig, 444 Pa.Super. 163, 663 A.2d 725, 726 (1995)).\nApplicant notes that the Commonwealth had months to acquire evidence sufficient to satisfy its burden, and that the trial court granted the Commonwealth numerous extensions of time to produce such evidence. Despite the time afforded to the Commonwealth, and despite the Common*1001wealth\u2019s invitation to the public to claim Applicant\u2019s inventory as stolen property, \u201cthe Commonwealth did not provide any direct or circumstantial evidence that the property which [Applicant] wanted returned was, in fact, derivative contraband.\u201d Trial Ct. Op. at 12 (emphasis in original). Applicant highlights the Commonwealth\u2019s concession that some percentage of the property seized was not evidence of a crime, and that the Commonwealth, therefore, had no entitlement to it. See Emergency Application at 12-13 (quoting Notes of Testimony, 5/26/2017, at 161) (statement of the Commonwealth that \u201cwe have never [ \u2014 ] not once [ \u2014 ] walked into this courtroom and said every single item in there [i]s stolen. God knows that some of this is not stolen .... \u201d).\nImportantly, the .trial court only ordered the return of the inventory for which no nexus of a crime had been established, allowing the Commonwealth to retain the pieces of jewelry that would serve as actual evidence of a crime. There is no legal theory that would allow the Commonwealth to retain indefinitely property that is lawfully owned and unconnected to any crime. The delineation between the property that was possessed unlawfully and the property that was obtained legitimately was based upon the trial court\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, which are owed substantial deference on appeal. For these reasons alone. Applicant has demonstrated a-substantial likelihood of success on the merits.3\nApplicant has established that it will suffer irreparable injury if it cannot reacquire'its lawfully-owned inventory. The trial court noted that, subsequent to the seizure of Applicant\u2019s inventory, Citizens Bank has sought to collect a $100,000.00 loan that was secured by the inventory. Trial Ct. Op. at- 14.4- Applicant cannot repay the loan due to the seizure, and has borrowed money from more than nine friends and relatives in an attempt to prevent Citizens Bank from seeking to acquire from the Commonwealth the jewelry serving as collateral and then proceeding to liquidate it for less than its fair market value. Id. at 15. Apart from Applicant\u2019s difficulties with the loan, Applicant is without inventory and cannot conduct business operations'. The trial -court credited evidence showing that the \u00a1owners of DUA were three -months behind in paying their home mortgage, \u2019and that foreclosure proceedings were- imminent. Id. The trial court credited evidence that Applicant has lost existing customers and prospective *1002new customers because its stores are closed and empty, causing Applicant\u2019s business \u201cimmeasurable harm.\u201d Id, The trial court credited evidence that Applicant is many months behind on paying its rent for the commercial leases for all of its storefronts, and that \u201ceviction will be certain.\u201d Id. The trial court credited evidence that the owners of DUA have three children and now cannot afford to purchase groceries for their family. Id. at 16.\nThe trial court noted that Applicant likely would not be able.to recoup any economic losses from the Commonwealth because, if Applicant later seeks to bring an action for damages, \u201cit would likely be blocked by immunity provisions applicable to governmental entities.\u201d Id, at 17. This appears to be correct. But let us assume for the sake of argument that Applicant later could somehow recover damages from the Commonwealth. The harm to Applicant still could not be undone. By that time, it likely would be out of business permanently. Its owners may have faced foreclosure and lost their family home. Financial and reputational ruin of this sort is not easily remedied by a.potential award of damages that might or might not arrive years in the future. And that is assuming, merely arguendo, Applicant\u2019s best-case scenario of being able to pursue such a claim at some later date, as opposed to the more likely eventuality that the Commonwealth\u2019s immunity would operate to deny Applicant any recourse whatsoever, as the trial court postulated. As such, Applicant has established that it faces immediate, irreparable harm if it cannot reacquire its lawfully-owned inventory and return to conducting its business operations.\nIn addition to the clear financial harm resulting from the. Commonwealth\u2019s retention of Applicant\u2019s inventory, the trial court noted that Applicant is being injured by the Commonwealth\u2019s website, inasmuch as \u201cthe Commonwealth is distributing [Applicant\u2019s] inventory to the public, some of whom are not the rightful owners.\u201d Id. The trial court \u201cheard evidence directly from the Montgomery County .District Attorney\u2019s .Office\u201d that nine people had claimed jewelry from the website, only later to return it, stating that they were not the rightful owners of the.items. Id. Perhaps somewhat, ironically, given that Applicant is alleged to have distributed property of which it was not the rightful owner, Applicant\u2019s \u201cinventory is being distributed to other than their rightful owners, which is obviously harming\u201d Applicant. Id,\nWith regard to potential harm to, the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to prosecute .the crimes alleged, Applicant notes, that the only property sought to be returned is the property determined to be unrelated to criminal activity. It remains undisputed that the Commonwealth may retain possession of1 the jewelry determined to be \u201cevidence\u201d of the alleged offenses. Applicant notes that the lawfully-obtained inventory \u201cis not \u2018evidence,\u2019 and very likely never will be,\u201d Emergency Application at 27. The trial court noted that Applicant \u201cis not seeking return of any items/jewelry [that] the Commonwealth is using to prosecute\u201d the participants in the alleged burglary ring. Trial Ct. Op. at 18. Regardless, in an abundance of caution, the trial court imposed the aboveTreferenced conditions upon Applicant, in order to protect against the irretrievable loss of inventory in the event that some items, later might be determined to be connected to the offenses at issue; The trial court further noted that, in setting up its website, the Commonwealth already has photographed and catalogued every piece of jewelry seized. \u201cTherefore, prophylactically, the Commonwealth already has whht' [it] n\u00e9ed[s] regarding photographs and catalogued information to be able to continue to -pursue [Applicant] should anyone else ever come forward to *1003make additional claims.\u201d Id. Under the circumstances, the Commonwealth will suffer no material prejudice by returning Applicant\u2019s lawfully-obtained inventory during the pendency of its appeal.\nApplicant argues that the public interest favors returning Applicant\u2019s lawfully-owned property and discouraging the \u201cabuse and overreach\u201d in which the Commonwealth has engaged. Emergency Application at 30. Reiterating the lack of harm to the Commonwealth, Applicant again asserts that, under the circumstances of the instant case, the \u201cpublic interest in protecting criminal prosecutions simply will not be compromised by the return of the inventory.\u201d Id. The trial court agreed with Applicant that the Commonwealth relied upon an impermissible expansion of the parameters of the search warrant, and that seizing and retaining all of Applicant\u2019s inventory, rather than the just the items for which probable cause was established, \u201coffends the basic notions of due process at the heart of our jurisprudence.\u201d Trial Ct. Op. at 14.1 agree wholeheartedly (or whole-mindedly) with the trial court\u2019s observation.\nIn essence, the police officers treated the search warrant as a general warrant. So armed, they deemed themselves authorized simply to seize all items possibly connected to a crime, regardless of whether probable cause existed for any individual item or whether the warrant specified the items to be seized with the requisite degree of particularity.\nOur search and seizure jurisprudence does not countenance such a haphazard, scattershot approach. Our Constitutions do not allow for items to be seized first and probable cause to be established second. Little difference may be found between the execution of the search warrant in the instant case and the operation of the infamous \u201cwrits of assistance\u201d in Colonial America, the abuses of which helped inspire the Framers to draft the Fourth Amendment and to include within it an essential and explicit particularity requirement.5 This is a basic, bedrock principle of our law. ' \u25a0\nThe proprietor of Applicant\u2019s businesses, Wasim Shazad, may very well be proven guilty of any number of criminal offenses. Let us assume for the moment that he is convicted. It has nonetheless remained undisputed by the parties throughout these proceedings that some substantial percentage of Applicant\u2019s inventory is part of Applicant\u2019s completely legitimate business operations. In its role as finder of fact, the trial court assessed the evidence, rendered its credibility determinations, and quantified the property that is not connected to a crime and is of no use to the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecutorial efforts. No public interest is served in allowing the Commonwealth to retain private property to which it has no entitlement. Applicant persuasively avers that \u201cit is in the public\u2019s interest to prevent overzealous government agents from making such a sweeping seizure and retaining private property indefi*1004nitely without any legal basis.\u201d Emergency Application at 30.\nThe Commonwealth certainly is entitled to its appeal in the Superior Court. However, the same appellate process that is designed to facilitate the dispensing of justice is here operating to deny it. The automatic supersedeas mechanism that attends the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is causing irreparable harm to a business and to the adults and children who rely upon that business. The Commonwealth already has taken steps to minimize any harm that may arise from lifting the supersedeas, and the trial court tailored its order to further mitigate any potential prejudice to the ongoing criminal proceedings. Because Applicant has established its likelihood of success on the merits, the severe and irreparable harm that it faces, the lack of harm to the Commonwealth, and the public interests that its requested relief would serve, I would grant Applicant\u2019s Emergency Application and would reinstate the trial court\u2019s order lifting the automatic su-persedeas. The Superior Court\u2019s error in dismissing the above-discussed considerations requires intervention in our extraordinary jurisdiction to \u201ccause right and justice to be done.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726.\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n. http://montcopa.org/JewelryWebsite (last visited August 18, 2017).\n\n\n. Rule 588 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part:\n(A) A person aggrieved by a search and seizure, whether or not executed pursuant to a warrant, may move for the return of the property on the ground that he or she is entitled to lawful possession thereof....\n(B) The judge hearing such motion shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision thereon. If the motion is granted, the property shall be restored unless the court determines that such property is contraband, in which case the court may order the property to be forfeited.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 588(A)-(B).\n\n\n. The Commonwealth also appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to transfer venue of Applicant\u2019s petition for return of property. The venue issue is pending before the Superi- or Court. Applicant does not address the venue issue in the instant application for emergency relief. Arguably, this omission could serve as a basis to conclude that Applicant has not established a \"likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d But I would not deny the Emergency Application upon these grounds. First, the Commonwealth\u2019s argument makes no mention of its challenge to the trial court\u2019s venue ruling, and the Commonwealth does not suggest it as a basis for this Court to deny relief to Applicant. More importantly, the venue issue is wholly independent from the merits of the issue upon which Applicant sought relief. Nowhere is if suggested that the ruling upon the substantive issue would have been different had the same evidence been presented to a trial court in Montgomery County \u2022 instead of Philadelphia County.\n\n\n. Again highlighting the legitimacy of much of Applicant\u2019s inventory, the trial court noted that the jewelry that served as collateral for the Citizens Bank loan was purchased lawfully from jewelry wholesalers, and that Applicant produced \"documentation showing purchases of their inventory from Alpha Gem Corp., Mehdioff Diamond Dealers Trading \u25a0 Company, Diamond Castle, Inc., New York Diamond Exchange, Inc., and many others , too numerous to list.\u201d Trial Ct. Op. at 10-11.\n\n\n. See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 608, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980) (\"[I]t was the abusive use of the warrant power ... that precipitated the Fourth Amendment, That Amendment grew out of colonial opposition to the infamous general warrants known as writs of assistance, which empowered customs officers to search at will, and to break open receptacles or packages, wherever they suspected uncustomed goods to be.\u201d); Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 485, 85 S.Ct. 506, 13 L.Ed.2d 431 (1965) (quoting Marron v.

As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\u201d).\n\n",
