Roadarmel, Jr.,\nSupervising Deputy Attorney General, Daniel C. Chang, Deputy Attorney General, for\nPlaintiff and Respondent.\n                                        _________________________\n\f       The jury found defendant and appellant Gregory Jackson guilty of forcible rape\n(Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2) [count 1]),1 two counts of forcible oral copulation (\u00a7\n288a, subd. (c)(2) [counts 2-3]), two counts of criminal threats (\u00a7 422, subd. (a) [counts 4\nand 6]), and assault with intent to commit rape or oral copulation (\u00a7 220, subd. (a)(1)\n[count 5]). The jury found true the allegations that defendant personally used a deadly\nand dangerous weapon in commission of the crimes charged in counts 5 and 6. (\u00a7 12022,\nsubd. (b)(1).)\n       In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found true as to counts 1-3 that\ndefendant suffered a prior sexual offense conviction for purposes of the one strike law.\n(\u00a7 667.61, subds. (a) & (d).) As to all counts, the court found that defendant suffered\nthree prior serious and/or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three\nstrikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and three prior serious felony\nconvictions within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1).\n       Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of 392-years-to-life. As to counts\n1-3, the trial court imposed consecutive terms of 25-years-to-life pursuant to the one\nstrike law, tripled to 75-years-to-life under the three strikes law. In counts 4-6, defendant\nwas sentenced to consecutive terms of 25-years-to-life. The sentences in counts 1-6 were\neach enhanced by 15 years based on the three serious felony prior convictions. The\nsentences in counts 5 and 6 were each also enhanced by one year for use of a deadly or\ndangerous weapon.\n       Defendant contends: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence\nof prior misdemeanor prostitution convictions of a complaining witness; (2) the trial court\nabused its discretion by excluding evidence of other prior misdemeanor convictions and\nan arrest suffered by complaining witnesses; (3) the trial court abused its discretion by\nrequiring that defendant present evidence of conduct evidencing moral turpitude rather\nthan the misdemeanor conviction of a witness; (4) the prosecutor improperly questioned\n\n\n       1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless stated otherwise.\n\n                                               2\n\fdefendant on cross-examination and committed prosecutorial misconduct in her closing\nargument; (5) the errors identified in defendant\u2019s first four contentions prejudiced\ndefendant in the aggregate; (6) the evidence was insufficient to support one of three prior\nserious felony enhancements; (7) the trial court erred when it failed to stay the sentences\non the criminal threats convictions in counts 4 and 6 pursuant to section 654; (8) the\nevidence was insufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction for criminal threats in count\n6; and (9) the evidence was insufficient to support the deadly or dangerous weapon\nfindings in counts 5 and 6.\n       The Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that there is insufficient evidence\nto support one of the prior serious felony enhancements. We further agree with\ndefendant that the sentence imposed in count 6 must be stayed pursuant to section 654.\nAdditionally, our review of the record disclosed that the abstract of judgment did not\nconform to the oral pronouncement of judgment as to the sentences in counts 1-3. After\nreviewing the parties\u2019 supplemental briefing on this issue, we conclude that the abstract\nof judgment must be corrected as to counts 1-3 to reflect that the sentences were imposed\nunder the one strike law as well as the three strikes law, and that the indeterminate term\nimposed on those counts is 75-years-to-life. In all other respects the judgment is\naffirmed.\n\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n\nProsecution\n\n\n       Counts 5 & 6: Victim Tammy J.\n\n\n       Tammy J. was driving her truck alone on Sierra Highway during the evening on\nSeptember 16, 2012. She pulled over because the truck stopped running. Tammy\nchecked the engine and noticed that it was hot, so she stood on the side of the road to wait\nfor it to cool down.\n\n                                             3\n\f       A van drove past her and made a U-turn. The driver, who Tammy later identified\nas defendant, pulled up behind her truck. Defendant got out of the van and approached\nher. Tammy was apprehensive about defendant because it was dark and the area was\n\u201cnot that great.\u201d\n       Defendant was pleasant and offered assistance. Tammy did not have her phone\nwith her, so she asked to borrow defendant\u2019s phone. He said that the battery had died,\nand quickly put his cell phone in his pocket.\n       Tammy suspected that she had run out of gas, though she could not be sure\nbecause the gauge was broken. Defendant said that he would get her more gas if she had\na gas can. Tammy retrieved a red plastic two-gallon gas can with a black mark on it from\nthe back of her truck and handed it to defendant. Defendant said that he would go get the\ngas, but that he needed to stop at the bank first.\n       Defendant put the gas can in his van. He told Tammy that he was worried about\nleaving her there because it was dark and the area was not safe. He told her that he was a\ngood guy and just wanted to get her truck running again. Nervous about the area and the\ndarkness, Tammy got into the van with defendant.\n       Defendant drove to a parking lot in an industrial area and parked. The area was\ndimly lit and many of the businesses were closed. There were no other people around.\n       Defendant got out of the driver\u2019s seat, put his leg between Tammy\u2019s legs, and\nplaced his left hand around Tammy\u2019s throat. He held \u201cwhat [Tammy] thought was a\nknife to [her] neck, something sharp . . . .\u201d It was dark in the van and she could not see.\nDefendant said, \u201cBitch, get in the back and get naked.\u201d Tammy asked if he was joking.\nHe responded, \u201cBitch, get in the back and get naked; otherwise, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Tammy\nwas \u201cscared to death.\u201d She tried to think of ways to escape, and reached for the door\nhandle. Defendant had put the knife down behind him, but when she reached for the door\nhe picked it up again and held it to her neck. He threatened, \u201cBitch, get in the back and\nget naked; otherwise I\u2019m going to stab you.\u201d Defendant put the knife down a second\ntime. Tammy got out of the van and ran, screaming for help. Tammy had been wearing\nflip flops, but they came off as she ran for help. She left her gas can in defendant\u2019s van.\n\n                                                4\n\f       Tammy ran to a street and tried to flag down help, but no one stopped. She ran a\nlittle over half a mile to a Panda Express. She did not look back as she was running. The\nrestaurant was closed, but there were two women inside cleaning. Tammy banged on the\ndoor and asked them to call 911. The women called the police but did not let her inside\nthe restaurant. Tammy sat outside at a table for approximately 45 minutes until police\narrived.\n       When Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Carl Forbes arrived at the Panda\nExpress, Tammy was out of breath, crying, and hysterical. Her hair was \u201cmessed up,\u201d\nand she was not wearing shoes. Deputy Forbes spoke with Tammy for about 30 minutes,\nand then drove her to where her truck was parked on the side of Sierra Highway. It was\nnear a closed car dealership. There were no open businesses in the area. Deputy Forbes\nhad Tammy retrace the route that defendant took to drive them to the industrial area. She\ntook Deputy Forbes to the spot where defendant parked the van and assaulted her. The\nindustrial area was deserted and not as well-lit as Sierra Highway. They found Tammy\u2019s\nflip flops nearby.\n       At trial, Tammy was shown photographs of a gas can recovered from defendant\u2019s\nvan. She testified that it was \u201cdefinitely\u201d hers.\n       Tammy did not take $50 from defendant, nor did she run out of defendant\u2019s van\nwith the money.\n\n\n       Counts 1-4: Diedra M.\n\n\n       Diedra M. was drinking beer in a bar parking lot while watching live music during\nthe evening of September 26, 2012. Diedra had parked her Ford Taurus at Village Grill,\nacross the street from the bar. After drinking for about an hour, Diedra decided to go\nhome, but realized she was too drunk to drive. She did not call her husband because she\ndid not have a cell phone or money to make a call. Diedra did not want to walk home\nbecause it was about a mile and a half away, so she decided to hitchhike. She made eye\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fcontact with defendant, who was driving a van on Sierra Highway. Defendant stopped to\npick her up.\n       Diedra got into the van and told defendant where she was going. He said he\nwould give her a ride, but that he needed to stop somewhere first. Defendant drove the\nvan to a house, where he parked. There were no streetlights in the area. Cars\noccasionally drove past, but there was no one else around. It was dark inside the van.\n       Defendant said, \u201cBitch, get in the back and take your clothes off.\u201d Defendant told\nDiedra, \u201cI don\u2019t play games.\u201d His hand was positioned on the side of his seat as if he was\nholding a weapon. Diedra was afraid that defendant would become violent. It was too\ndark for her to tell for certain if he had a weapon. Diedra took off all her clothes.\nDefendant told Diedra he wanted to look at her. He used a lighter to see her, and asked\nher how old she was. When she responded he seemed disappointed. Diedra complied\nwith defendant\u2019s direction to get into the back of the van. Diedra was afraid that\ndefendant would hurt her if she did not obey him. She told him she did not want any\nproblems, and that he did not have to do what he was doing. Defendant took off his pants\nand demanded that Diedra \u201csuck his dick.\u201d She complied because she did not want to get\nhurt. Defendant repositioned himself and demanded more oral sex. This continued for \u201ca\nlong time.\u201d Defendant repositioned himself multiple times during the oral copulation.\nDiedra began crying. She asked defendant to let her go. He replied that \u201che would let\n[her] go when [he] was finished and that he didn\u2019t know [why she] was crying because he\nwas going to pay [her].\u201d She said she did not want to be paid, she just wanted him to let\nher go. Defendant said he wanted to perform oral sex on her. She refused to lie down\nbecause she \u201cwas scared [she] wouldn\u2019t get back up.\u201d She told defendant she was afraid.\nShe then sat with her legs open and defendant touched her vagina once with his mouth.\nShe told him that she was scared repeatedly. She pleaded for him to stop and told him\nthat she had children. Defendant replied, \u201cShut that shit up.\u201d He said he would let her\ngo, but she had to finish first.\n       Defendant demanded sexual intercourse. Diedra told him she was married, and\nasked him to use a condom. Defendant pulled out a condom from somewhere beside\n\n                                              6\n\fhim. Diedra continued to cry. Defendant did not seem to care and kept telling her to stop\ntalking. Diedra could not see a way to escape. Defendant was big, and he was in\nbetween her and the door. Defendant put on the condom. He inserted the tip of his penis\ninto her vagina. Diedra refused to lie down. He was unable to fully insert his penis into\nher because she kept moving her body.\n       Defendant lost his erection. He sat down next to Diedra and demanded oral sex\nagain. She was crying so hysterically that she could not perform oral sex because her\nnose was filled with mucus. Defendant gave her his shirt to blow her nose in. He asked\nher to talk to him, and sat down next to her. He told her \u201cthat he had to finish what he\nwas doing because it mess[ed] with him physically if he [didn\u2019t] complete it.\u201d He said he\nwould let her go. Diedra responded that if he was going to let her go he should give her\nbra to her. Defendant gave Diedra her bra. She then asked for her shirt. Defendant gave\nit to her and said, \u201cSee, I\u2019m going to let you go.\u201d Diedra then said that if he was going to\nlet her go he should give her pants back, and defendant got very angry. He said, \u201cBitch,\nyou going to suck my dick till I come or I\u2019m going to cut your throat and slash your face\nand watch you bleed.\u201d He told her he liked to \u201cwatch[] bitches bleed.\u201d Diedra thought\nshe was never going to see her children again. She thought she was going to die.\n       When defendant leaned back to receive more oral copulation, Diedra escaped\nthrough the driver\u2019s side door. Defendant came to the front of the van and told her to get\nin. She said that she was not getting in. He threw her clothes out of the van. Diedra\nwent to the road quickly and flagged down a man in a car. She was terrified. Defendant\nstarted the van and left. Diedra told the man she had been raped and asked if he could\ntake her back to her car. He called the police, but did not let her into his vehicle.\n       Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Melissa Navarro responded to the call and\nspoke with Diedra. Diedra was upset and crying, and had difficulty speaking. It took\nabout 20 minutes for her to calm down enough to talk to Deputy Navarro. After she\ncalmed down, Diedra relayed the events to Deputy Navarro. Deputy Navarro smelled\nalcohol on Diedra\u2019s breath and believed that she had been drinking. The deputy searched\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fDiedra and found loose change and her California identification card. The deputy did not\nfind a $20 bill in Diedra\u2019s possession.\n       Deputy Navarro drove Diedra home, and then drove to the Village Grill parking\nlot to try to find Diedra\u2019s car. She observed a single car parked in the lot, which was later\ndetermined to be a 1999 Ford Taurus.\n       Diedra testified she was not working as a prostitute on the night of the incident.\nShe did not discuss performing oral copulation on defendant in exchange for $20, and she\ndid not smoke crack cocaine with defendant in his van.\n\n\n       Defendant\u2019s Arrest, Search of the Van, and Scientific Evidence\n\n\n       At approximately 3:00 a.m. on the day after Diedra was sexually assaulted,\nDeputy Forbes saw defendant driving a vehicle matching the description that Tammy had\ngiven of defendant\u2019s van. Deputy Forbes initiated a traffic stop, spoke with defendant,\nplaced him under arrest, and impounded the van.\n       Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department Sergeant Troy Bowser searched\ndefendant\u2019s van. Sergeant Bowser recovered a box of condoms from the center seat row,\na used condom from the rear map pocket of the front passenger seat, and a red two-gallon\ngas can that Tammy later identified as belonging to her.\n       Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department criminalist Leslie Thompson inspected\nthe used condom and collected cellular material. She collected semen in an exterior swab\nof the condom and seminal fluid on an interior swab. Ms. Thompson determined there\nwas a major contributor and a minor contributor to the sample obtained from the condom.\nDefendant\u2019s DNA profile matched the profile of the major contributor. The profile of the\nminor contributor matched Diedra\u2019s DNA profile.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f          Testimony of Maria H.\n\n\n          On February 22, 1991, Maria H. was 16 years old.2 She was walking with her\nfriend, Jacqueline, when defendant stopped them. Defendant asked if they wanted \u201ca\nride.\u201d They wanted a ride home, so they said yes and got into his vehicle. Defendant\ndrove the girls to the desert. He told them he had a gun, and pressed something metal\nthat felt like a gun to the back of Maria\u2019s head. He ordered Jacqueline to get out, and\nthen drove Maria further into the desert. Defendant stopped the vehicle, put his arm\nacross Maria\u2019s throat, and threatened to kill her. He put his mouth on her vagina and\ninserted his penis into her vagina. When he was done he let her go. He said something\nlike, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a head start.\u201d Maria ran to a road for help. A passerby called the\npolice.\n\n\nDefense\n\n\n          Defendant testified on his own behalf. Early one evening in September 2012, he\nwas driving his father\u2019s van on Sierra Highway, intending to get high with a prostitute.\nHe had crack cocaine in a toolbox inside the van. Defendant saw Tammy walking on the\nside of the road toward a motel. She waved at him, so he thought she was a prostitute.\n          Defendant pulled up next to Tammy and she immediately got into the van. He\nsaid he was \u201clooking to party\u201d and asked her what she was \u201cinto.\u201d Tammy said she was\ninto \u201cspeed.\u201d Defendant told her he did not have speed, and offered her money. She\nagreed. Defendant gave her two $20 bills and one $10 bill for a total of $50.\n          Tammy told him where they could go to get speed, but it was far away, so\ndefendant parked in a factory parking lot instead. He said, \u201c[C]ome on baby. Let\u2019s get in\nthe back.\u201d Tammy agreed. Defendant went to the back of the van and sat down. He\n\n\n\n\n          2   Maria testified at trial under the name \u201cMaria A.\u201d\n\n                                                  9\n\fheard the front passenger door slam, so he went to the front of the van to see what was\ngoing on. He saw Tammy running away.\n       On another evening in September 2012, defendant drank alcohol and used crack\ncocaine at the Shadow Park Motel with a group of men. He was driving out of the\nparking lot when he saw Diedra in front of the motel. She was standing with some other\ngirls, one of whom he knew as \u201cBlack.\u201d Several months earlier, defendant had given\nBlack drugs in exchange for sex. Defendant waved for Diedra to get in his van. He told\nher he wanted to \u201cparty.\u201d She said she did, too, and asked, \u201c[W]hat you got?\u201d Defendant\ntold her he had crack cocaine. Diedra said, \u201c[A]ll you have to do is give me a hit and I\nturn into a free mama.\u201d Diedra then indicated she was skilled at oral copulation.\n       Diedra told defendant where to drive. After defendant parked the van, they sat on\nits floor, smoking cocaine, for about an hour and a half. Diedra orally copulated him, but\ndefendant did not ejaculate. He never inserted his penis into her vagina.\n       Defendant and Diedra consumed all of defendant\u2019s $100 worth of cocaine.\nDefendant refused to get more cocaine. Diedra swore at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get\nyou.\u201d Defendant said he would give her money to buy more drugs. She became very\nagitated and paced back and forth in the van. Diedra got out of the van, but continued\nswearing at defendant. He threw $20 at her, but she threw it back at him. Defendant\ndrove away.\n       Defendant did not believe there were any condoms in the van. If there were\ncondoms, they might belong to his father. Defendant knew a used condom was found in\nthe van, but denied using a condom with Diedra. When questioned whether it would\nsurprise him to learn that the used condom was found to include both his and Diedra\u2019s\nDNA, he responded, \u201cIt would surprise me because it\u2019s impossible.\u201d Although Diedra\nperformed oral sex on defendant, he never performed oral sex on her, never penetrated\nher vaginally, and he did not achieve orgasm. He did not have sexual intercourse with\nprostitutes because he did not want to catch any diseases. Defendant did not threaten\nDiedra, or become physically violent with her. He did not have any weapons in the van.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       Defendant testified that he was convicted of forcible rape while acting in concert\nin 1991. The victim was a prostitute named Cynthia J. He was convicted for the forcible\nrape of Maria, a 16-year-old prostitute, also in 1991. Defendant denied having sex with\nMaria, but admitted that he pleaded guilty to raping her by force.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\nExclusion of Diedra\u2019s Prior Misdemeanor Convictions for Prostitution\n\n\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding Diedra\u2019s two 1997\nmisdemeanor convictions for prostitution. Defendant further contends that the trial court\nerred when it \u201cappeared\u201d to exclude evidence that Diedra had worked as a prostitute in\nthe recent past, and specifically on any day other than the night the crimes took place. He\nargues the evidence was admissible to impeach Diedra\u2019s credibility. We agree with the\nAttorney General that these contentions are both forfeited and fail on the merits.\n\n\n       Relevant Proceedings\n\n\n       Before the jury was empanelled, the prosecutor moved to exclude evidence of\nDiedra\u2019s two misdemeanor convictions for prostitution (\u00a7 647, subd. (b)), which she\nsuffered in September and October of 1997. The prosecutor argued the misdemeanor\nconvictions should be excluded because they were too remote in time. The trial court\nasked defense counsel whether he intended to impeach Diedra with the two convictions:\n       \u201c[Defense counsel]: Yes, your honor. The defense in this case essentially is that\nDiedra was acting as a prostitute on the night in question, that the business transaction\nwent bad. Consequently, she made up lies about [defendant], about what he had done.\n[\u00b6] And I think that even though they\u2019re old, . . . she will be asked on the night in\nquestion was she working as a prostitute. I believe from her previous statements and\ntestimony she will say no. [\u00b6] I would like to ask her, have you ever worked as a\n\n                                             11\n\fprostitute. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019ll say to that question. If she says no, she hasn\u2019t, I\nwould like to use those convictions to impeach her. If she says yes, she has, then I don\u2019t\nneed to get into those specific convictions.\n       \u201cThe Court: So you are not actually seeking to introduce them as crimes of moral\nturpitude; you\u2019re actually talking about [Evidence Code section] 1101 type of evidence as\nto the victim that you\u2019re talking about her actions in conformity with prior actions,\ncorrect?\n       \u201c[Defense counsel]: Yes. I would agree with that, Your Honor, but having said\nalready if she denies having worked as a prostitute, I would then want to use those priors\nfor impeachment purposes.\u201d\n       The trial court then gave the prosecutor the opportunity to respond.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor]: I would just add, your honor, that this statement that the defendant\nmakes, he declares that both of the victims were prostitutes at the time of the assaults on\ntwo separate occasions. [\u00b6] I believe that counsel asking Diedra if she was working on\nthe evening of the assault as a prostitute is appropriate, but anything beyond that I believe\nis [subject to Evidence Code section] 1101 and inappropriate.\n       \u201c[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, factually, so you know, my understanding of the\ndiscovery is that Diedra essentially waived down [defendant]. She flagged him down,\nasked him for a ride. [\u00b6] . . . She claimed she drank too much alcohol that night at a bar\nand did not want to drive her car home. She was hitchhiking and flagging down\nmotorists. [\u00b6] I would think that her knowledge about that, things that can happen and\ndo happen, is related to her prior experience working as a prostitute, and I would think\nthat it could go to state of mind on her part as to what she was doing and what concerns,\nif any, she had while doing it.\n       \u201cThe Court: Okay. I honestly don\u2019t follow you there. I do think that in analyzing\nwhether or not she was working as a prostitute that night is certainly relevant. [\u00b6] You\ncan cross-examine her in terms of her actions to support or undermine whatever her\nstatement is, but the fact that someone suffered . . . two misdemeanor convictions for\nprostitution 17 years ago, I think that the probative value is very minimal. [\u00b6] In\n\n                                               12\n\faddition, even trying to get there by asking her, well, isn\u2019t it true that you have been a\nprostitute in the past, I don\u2019t see what the relevance of that that [sic] is as to what\nhappened on that night. So the probative value seems very minimal to me. [\u00b6] On the\nother hand, the prejudicial effect of confusing the issues for the jury, and we are talking\nabout something that is quite remote 17 years ago, the prejudicial effect in terms of the\nundue consumption of time and confusion of the issues does appear to me to substantially\noutweigh any minimal probative value. [\u00b6] Therefore, under Evidence Code section 352,\nI will grant the People\u2019s motion to exclude any reference to those prior misdemeanor\nconvictions from 1997.\u201d\n       Later, the court reiterated its ruling:\n       \u201cThe Court: Well, again, counsel, I said your questioning as to what [Diedra] was\ndoing that night and what she said that night, that\u2019s all admissible. It\u2019s 17 years ago that\n\u2026 [\u00b6] \u2014we\u2019re not getting into.\n\n\n       Legal Principles\n\n\n       Evidence the victim participated in a form of prostitution is evidence of conduct\ninvolving moral turpitude, which is admissible for impeachment purposes. (People v.\nChandler (1997) 56 Cal. App. 4th 703, 708-709 (Chandler).) Court records of\nmisdemeanor convictions are also admissible to prove both \u201cthe fact of conviction, [and]\n\u2026 that the offense reflected in the record occurred\u201d under an exception to the hearsay\nrule. (People v. Duran (2002) 97 Cal. App. 4th 1448, 1461 (Duran); see Evid. Code, \u00a7\n452.5.) However, Evidence Code sections 782 and 1103, subdivision (c), place limits on\nhow and under what circumstances a victim\u2019s prior sexual behavior can be admitted in a\ntrial of sexual assault charges. (Chandler, supra, at p. 707.)\n       \u201c[Evidence Code] [s]ection 1103, subdivision (c), provides that a defendant cannot\nintroduce opinion evidence, reputation evidence, and evidence of specific instances of the\nalleged victim\u2019s previous sexual conduct with persons other than the defendant to prove\nthe victim consented to the sexual acts alleged. In adopting this section the Legislature\n\n                                                 13\n\frecognized that evidence of the alleged victim\u2019s consensual sexual activities with others\nhas little relevance to whether consent was given in a particular instance. [Citation.]\u201d\n(Chandler, supra, 56 Cal.App.4th at p. 707, fn. omitted.) Although admission of the\nvictim\u2019s past sexual conduct for purposes of proving consent is strictly precluded,\nEvidence Code section 1103, subdivision (c)(4), allows the admission of evidence of\nprior sexual conduct relevant to the credibility of the victim. (Ibid.)\n       \u201cEvidence Code section 782 specifies a procedure requiring an in camera review\nof the proffered evidence to diminish the potential abuse of section 1103, subdivision\n(c)(4).\u201d (Chandler, supra, 56 Cal.App.4th at pp. 707-708.) \u201c[Evidence Code] [s]ection\n782 requires that the testimony be preceded by a written motion by the defendant\naccompanied by an affidavit containing an offer of proof. If the trial court finds that the\noffer of proof is \u2018sufficient,\u2019 it must conduct a hearing out of the presence of the jury and\nallow the alleged victim to be questioned \u2018\u201cregarding the offer of proof . . . . At the\nconclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that evidence proposed to be offered by the\ndefendant regarding the sexual conduct of the complaining witness is relevant . . . and is\nnot inadmissible pursuant to Section 352 of [the Evidence Code], the court may make an\norder stating what evidence may be introduced by the defendant, and the nature of\nquestions to be permitted. The defendant may then offer evidence pursuant to the order\nof the court.\u201d\u2019 (See People v. Blackburn [(1976)] 56 Cal. App. 3d 685, 691.)\u201d (People v.\nSims (1976) 64 Cal. App. 3d 544, 553-554 (Sims).)\n       Evidence Code section 782 vests broad discretion in the trial court to weigh the\ndefendant\u2019s proffered evidence prior to its submission to the jury and to resolve the\nconflicting interests of the victim and the defendant. (People v. Rioz (1984) 161\nCal. App. 3d 905, 916 (Rioz).) In addition, the statute reaffirms the role of Evidence Code\nsection 352 in authorizing the trial court to exclude relevant evidence that is more\nprejudicial than probative. (Ibid.; People v. Casas (1986) 181 Cal. App. 3d 889, 896.)\nThe statutes do not permit the trial judge to make a credibility determination at the in\ncamera hearing. Instead, the trial judge must evaluate the proffered evidence under the\nadmissibility guidelines set forth in Evidence Code section 352, weighing prejudicial\n\n                                             14\n\feffect versus probative value and additional evidentiary criteria. Credibility of the\nproffered witness is not included under these guidelines. (Chandler, supra, 56\nCal.App.4th at p. 711.)\n       \u201c[T]he latitude [Evidence Code] section 352 allows for exclusion of impeachment\nevidence in individual cases is broad. The statute empowers courts to prevent criminal\ntrials from degenerating into nitpicking wars of attrition over collateral credibility\nissues.\u201d (People v. Wheeler (1992) 4 Cal. 4th 284, 296 (Wheeler).) \u201cWhen exercising its\ndiscretion under Evidence Code section 352, a court must always take into account, as\napplicable, those factors traditionally deemed pertinent in this area.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201c[C]ourts\nmay and should consider with particular care whether the admission of such evidence\nmight involve undue time, confusion, or prejudice which outweighs its probative value.\u201d\n(Id. at pp. 296-297, fn. omitted.) We review a trial court\u2019s ruling under Evidence Code\nsection 352 for abuse of discretion. (People v. Cudjo (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 585, 609 (Cudjo).)\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       We conclude defendant has forfeited his challenge to exclusion of the 1997\nmisdemeanor prostitution convictions and to the alleged exclusion of evidence that\nDiedra worked as a prostitute in the recent past on several grounds.\n       First, the trial court did not rule on the issue of evidence that Diedra worked as a\nprostitute in the recent past. Defendant\u2019s arguments do not persuade us that the court\nintended to rule on this issue. The trial court stated: \u201c[T]he fact that someone suffered . .\n. two misdemeanor convictions for prostitution 17 years ago, I think that the probative\nvalue is very minimal. [\u00b6] In addition, even trying to get there by asking her, well, isn\u2019t\nit true that you have been a prostitute in the past, I don\u2019t see what the relevance of that\nthat [sic] is as to what happened on that night.\u201d (emphasis added.) The trial court made\nno mention of the \u201crecent past\u201d in its ruling. It was specifically addressing the issue of\nthe 17-year-old misdemeanor prostitution convictions as raised by the prosecution, and\nclarifying that it did not matter how defendant intended to introduce the evidence. It\n\n                                              15\n\fdetermined that the misdemeanor prostitution convictions simply did not have sufficient\nrelevance to be admitted in light of other considerations. Even if defense counsel\nbelieved evidence of Diedra\u2019s recent past prostitution was excluded by the court\u2019s ruling,\nhe failed to preserve the issue for appeal because he did not press for a definitive ruling\nfrom the trial court. (People v. Morris (1991) 53 Cal. 3d 152, 195, disapproved on\nanother ground in People v. Stansbury (1995) 9 Cal. 4th 824, 830, fn. 1.)\n       Second, defendant forfeited his argument because he made no offer of proof as to\nwhether Diedra had worked as a prostitute in the recent past, up to the day before the\nincident. \u201c\u2018It is the burden of the proponent of evidence to establish its relevance through\nan offer of proof or otherwise,\u2019 and a specific offer of proof is necessary in order to\npreserve an evidentiary ruling for appeal. [Citation.] \u2018An offer of proof should give the\ntrial court an opportunity to change or clarify its ruling and in the event of appeal would\nprovide the reviewing court with the means of determining error and assessing prejudice.\n[Citation.] To accomplish these purposes an offer of proof must be specific. It must set\nforth the actual evidence to be produced and not merely the facts or issues to be\naddressed and argued.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Brady (2005) 129 Cal. App. 4th 1314,\n1332.) Defense counsel gave no explanation of what proof he intended to offer other the\n1997 misdemeanor prostitution convictions, let alone a specific explanation of the\nevidence.\n       Third, defense counsel did not file a written motion or otherwise comply with the\nprocedures of Evidence Code section 782 with respect to either the 1997 prostitution\nconvictions or any evidence of recent prostitution Diedra may have engaged in.\nDefendant is therefore precluded from complaining of error in the trial court\u2019s exclusion\nof such evidence. (See Sims, supra, 64 Cal.App.3d at p. 554 [defendant failed to file an\naffidavit or written motion as required by Evidence Code section 782 and therefore\ncannot complain of error on appeal].)\n       To avoid forfeiture, defendant argues that counsel\u2019s inaction denied him the\neffective assistance of counsel. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       \u201cTo establish a violation of the constitutional right to effective assistance of\ncounsel, a defendant must show both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient when\nmeasured against the standard of a reasonably competent attorney and that this deficient\nperformance caused prejudice in the sense that it \u2018so undermined the proper functioning\nof the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just\nresult.\u2019 [Citations.] If a defendant has failed to show that the challenged actions of\ncounsel were prejudicial, a reviewing court may reject the claim on that ground without\ndetermining whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Kipp\n(2001) 26 Cal. 4th 1100, 1122-1123.)\n       \u201c\u2018If the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the\nmanner challenged, an appellate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be\nrejected unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or there\nsimply could be no satisfactory explanation. (People v. Mendoza Tello (1997) 15 Cal. 4th\n264, 266.) Otherwise, the claim is more appropriately raised in a petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus.\u2019 (People v. Carter (2003) 30 Cal. 4th 1166, 1211.)\u201d (People v. Gray\n(2005) 37 Cal. 4th 168, 207.)\n       Here, the record is silent regarding the reason for counsel\u2019s failure to object more\nexplicitly or follow the procedure required in Evidence Code section 782. Accordingly,\nthe issue is more appropriately raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n       Moreover, defendant has not carried his burden of establishing prejudice. (Cal.\nConst., art. VI, \u00a7 13.) The probative value of the 1997 prostitution convictions was\nminimal. As the trial court stated, the convictions were very remote in time. It would be\npure speculation to infer that because Diedra had prostituted herself then, she was\nnecessarily prostituting herself 17 years later on the night of the crimes, or that her crimes\nof moral turpitude in 1997 were relevant to her veracity in 2012. This case is not\nanalogous to People v. Varona (1983) 143 Cal. App. 3d 566 (Varona), and People v.\nRandle (1982) 130 Cal. App. 3d 286 (Randle), as defendant urges. Both Verona and\nRandle involved conduct that was close in time to the charged crimes and similar in\nnature. In Varona, the defendants were found guilty of rape, oral copulation, and false\n\n                                             17\n\fimprisonment. The defendants claimed the victim solicited them and agreed to engage in\nsex acts for money, but became angry when defendants did not pay her. The appellate\ncourt held that the trial court erred in excluding evidence that the victim had pled guilty\nto prostitution, was on probation for that conviction at the time of the crimes, had\nfrequented the area where the crimes occurred while working as a prostitute, and\nspecialized in oral copulation in addition to sexual intercourse. (Varona, supra, at pp.\n569-570.) In Randle, the defendant was accused of forcing the victim to orally copulate\nhim in a bar restroom after the two danced and the victim had several drinks. (Randle,\nsupra, at pp. 289-290.) A new trial was ordered after discovery of voluminous evidence\nof the victim\u2019s habit of soliciting public sex acts in exchange for money and drinks. (Id.\nat pp. 293-294.) The circumstances in Varona and Randle are in no way comparable to\nthe instant case.\n       Here, there is no evidence of similarity or connection between the misdemeanor\nprostitution convictions and the crimes. The slight probative value of the prior\nconvictions is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial risk of evoking \u201can emotional\nbias against [the victim].\u201d (People v. Yu (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d, 358, 377.) Questioning\nDiedra broadly about her prostitution activities in the \u201crecent past\u201d with no evidence that\nshe had engaged in prostitution in the 15 years before trial would have the effect of\nimpermissibly placing Diedra on trial. (See Rioz, supra, 161 Cal.App.3d at p. 916.) The\ntrial court could reasonably conclude this line of questioning would unduly consume time\nat trial and confuse the jury by causing it to focus on collateral issues. Because the\nrelevance for impeachment was slight and its potential for prejudice, undue consumption\nof time, and confusion of the jury was significant, the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in refusing to admit the 1997 misdemeanor prostitution convictions or any\nunspecified evidence regarding the possibility of more recent prostitution.\n       Defendant argues that the exclusion of evidence denied him his constitutional\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to present a defense and to confrontation. These\narguments were not raised below and are forfeited. Even if the issues are properly before\nus on appeal, we conclude defendant\u2019s arguments are without merit.\n\n                                             18\n\f       The trial court properly applied state evidentiary law, which did not impinge on\ndefendant\u2019s due process rights. (See People v. Riccardi (2012) 54 Cal. 4th 758, 809.)\nMoreover, defendant was not denied his right to confrontation. Defendant was not\nprevented from presenting relevant evidence. He was permitted to ask Diedra if she was\nworking as a prostitute on the night of the crime. He presented evidence in support of his\ntheory that Diedra was working as a prostitute that night. Defendant testified to his\nversion of events, and evidence of Diedra\u2019s conduct on the night of the crimes was\nadmitted. The jury was told that Diedra was very drunk and in an area where defendant\nhad solicited prostitutes in the past. She claimed to have decided to hitchhike despite the\nfact that her car was parked across the street from the bar, and despite the fact that she\nlived only a mile and a half away. She flagged defendant down on the highway. She\nvoluntarily entered his van at night, although he was a complete stranger to her. The jury\nheard from both defendant and Diedra that defendant tried to pay her for the sexual acts\nthat occurred. In sum, there was no evidence with more than minimal probative value\nthat defendant was prevented from introducing in support of his defense. Defendant\u2019s\nconstitutional rights were not violated. (See People v. Cunningham (2001) 25 Cal. 4th\n926, 999 [\u201cAlthough the complete exclusion of evidence intended to establish an\naccused\u2019s defense may impair his or her right to due process of law, the exclusion of\ndefense evidence on a minor or subsidiary point does not interfere with that constitutional\nright\u201d].)\n       Even if the trial court had erred in excluding the 1997 prostitution misdemeanors,\nthere has been no miscarriage of justice. \u201cAlthough defendant asserts the standard of\nreview is the \u2018harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard prescribed in Chapman v.\nCalifornia (1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [(Chapman)], we have held the application of ordinary\nrules of evidence like Evidence Code section 352 does not implicate the federal\nConstitution, and thus we review allegations of error under the \u2018reasonable probability\u2019\nstandard of [People v.] Watson [(1956)] 46 Cal.2d [818,] 836 [(Watson)]. [Citations.]\nAlthough we apply Watson, we note that the result would be the same under Chapman.\u201d\n(People v. Marks (2003) 31 Cal. 4th 197, 226-227.)\n\n                                             19\n\f       The evidence in support of defendant\u2019s convictions was overwhelming. Diedra\u2019s\ntestimony was corroborated by the police investigation. She testified that defendant used\na condom when he inserted his penis into her vagina. A box of condoms was discovered\nin the center console of the van. A used condom was also discovered inside the vehicle.\nTesting revealed that it had both parties\u2019 DNA on the interior and the exterior, as would\nhave been the case if Diedra\u2019s story was true. Defendant\u2019s veracity was seriously\nundermined by the condom and DNA evidence, as he had testified that he did not have\nany condoms in the van, had not used a condom with Diedra, and had not had sexual\nintercourse with Diedra. Defendant was adamant that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for his and\nDiedra\u2019s DNA would be found on the used condom. His protestations that such evidence\nwould not be found in his van brought the rest of his testimony into serious question.\nAdditionally, Deputy Navarro testified that Diedra was so emotionally distraught when\nshe tried to question her that she had difficulty speaking. It took Diedra 20 minutes to\ncalm down enough for the deputy to interview her, consistent with the trauma Diedra\nclaimed to have suffered.\n       Tammy\u2019s testimony was also corroborated. When Deputy Forbes arrived she was\nhysterical, out of breath, and crying. Her hair was messed up and she was shoeless,\nconsistent with her account of events. Tammy took the deputy back to her truck, which\nwas parked on the side of the road on Sierra Highway, as she had told him it was when\ndefendant picked her up. She retraced the route defendant took her with the deputy, and\nwhen they arrived at the location where defendant had parked the van, they found her flip\nflops, which she had told the deputy came off as she fled. A search of defendant\u2019s van\nrevealed a gas can inside, which was identical to the one Tammy had described leaving\nthere. At trial she identified a photograph of the gas can as \u201cdefinitely\u201d hers.\n       The circumstances of the attacks described by the women were very similar.\nDefendant picked up both Tammy and Diedra in a van on Sierra Highway in the evening,\nwhen they were alone, weeks apart. Both women were obviously vulnerable. Tammy\nhad car trouble, while Diedra was inebriated. Defendant told both women that he would\ngive them a ride home, but that he had to stop somewhere first. He drove both women to\n\n                                             20\n\fdark, secluded areas. He threatened them similarly, saying, \u201cBitch, get in the back and\nget naked\u201d to Tammy, and \u201cBitch, get in the back and take your clothes off\u201d to Diedra.\n       In light of the overwhelming evidence against him, it is not \u201creasonably probable\nthat a result more favorable to [defendant] would have been reached in the absence of the\nerror.\u201d (Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) Any error was also \u201charmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\u201d (Chapman, supra, 386 U.S. at p. 24.) We conclude that the exclusion\nof the prior prostitution evidence, and defense counsel\u2019s failure to preserve the issues for\nappeal, were not prejudicial and did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\n\nExclusion of Diedra\u2019s Other Convictions and Tammy\u2019s Misdemeanor Arrest\n\n\n       Defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Diedra\u2019s other convictions\nand Tammy\u2019s misdemeanor arrest. We conclude the contentions are not meritorious, and\nany error was harmless.\n\n\n       Relevant Proceedings\n\n\n       Prior to trial, the prosecutor also moved to exclude Diedra\u2019s 1992 conviction for\nburglary (\u00a7 459), 1997 conviction for hit and run (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20001), and 2003\nmisdemeanor conviction for assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245), arguing that the\nconvictions were too remote in time to have significant probative value. Defense counsel\nsought to use the prior convictions for impeachment.\n       The trial court ruled:\n       \u201cI will allow the defense to impeach with the [Penal Code section] 245\n[conviction] from 2003, although that also is remote in time. [\u00b6] I do believe the victim\nshouldn\u2019t be given an enhanced aura of veracity or having a clean record just because it\nhas been so long, so I\u2019ll let you impeach with that last misdemeanor if you choose to do\nso. [\u00b6] As far as the cases from the 1990\u2019s, they are simply too remote and any probative\nvalue as the years go on and as she remains crime free or conviction free becomes less\n\n                                             21\n\fand less probative, so I\u2019ll allow you to impeach with the most recent one. The others are\nexcluded.\u201d3\n       The prosecutor then moved to exclude evidence of Tammy\u2019s 2006 arrest for grand\ntheft (\u00a7 487, subd. (a)), which the defense sought to admit as impeachment evidence.\nThe trial court excluded the evidence:\n       \u201cIt\u2019s only an arrest. It\u2019s not a conviction. Again, in terms of all of the analysis\nunder [Evidence Code section] 352, any minimal probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the undue consumption of time and confusion of issues, especially when\nwe\u2019re talking about a 2006 arrest and that\u2019s the only information that we have.\u201d\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       A misdemeanor conviction for a crime of moral turpitude is admissible for\nimpeachment purposes where its probative value is not outweighed by prejudice, undue\nconsumption of time, or the possibility of confusing the jury. (Duran, supra, 97\nCal.App.4th at p. 1461; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 452.5.) We review the trial court\u2019s exclusion\nof evidence for abuse of discretion. (Cudjo, supra, 6 Cal.4th at p. 609.)\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion with respect to Diedra\u2019s\nmisdemeanor convictions. Diedra\u2019s convictions for burglary and hit and run were remote\nin time. Just as the 1997 misdemeanor prostitution convictions had little relevance in\n2012, her other convictions for crimes of moral turpitude in 1992 and 1997 had limited\nrelevance to her credibility 15 or more years later. Even considered together with the\nconviction in 2003 for assault with a deadly weapon, the trial court could reasonably\nconclude there is not a continued pattern of dishonesty, given the large gap in years\nbetween the crimes. Introducing evidence of misdemeanors with little relevance to\n\n\n\n       3 The trial court also excluded Diedra\u2019s 2003 arrest for unlawful possession of a\ncontrolled substance (Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350). Defendant does not challenge that\nruling.\n\n                                             22\n\fDiedra\u2019s veracity so many years later would necessarily confuse the issues for the jury\nand unduly consume time at trial.\n       With respect to Tammy\u2019s 2006 arrest for grand theft, evidence of prior arrests is\ninadmissible to impeach a witness. (People v. Anderson (1978) 20 Cal. 3d 647, 650;\nPeople v. Lopez (2005) 129 Cal. App. 4th 1508, 1523 [\u201cit is established that evidence of\nmere arrests is inadmissible because it is more prejudicial than probative\u201d].) Defendant\nargues for the first time on appeal that the conduct underlying the arrest is admissible.\nHaving not raised the issue with the trial court, he has failed to preserve it for appeal.\n(Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.) The trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n       Finally, any error in excluding this evidence was harmless, for the reasons\ndiscussed above.\n\n\nExclusion of Maria\u2019s Misdemeanor Conviction\n\n\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in requiring him to present evidence\nof the conduct underlying Maria\u2019s 2008 misdemeanor conviction for theft (\u00a7 484), rather\nthan admitting her conviction. Without addressing the merits of the contention, we hold\nthat any error was harmless.\n\n\n       Relevant Proceedings\n\n\n       Outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel raised the issue of admission of\nMaria\u2019s prior conviction. Defense counsel stated that the prosecutor indicated Maria may\nhave had a 2008 conviction, which he intended to use for impeachment. The prosecutor\nverified that Maria did, in fact, have a conviction for theft (\u00a7 484) in 2008. The\nprosecutor argued that the conviction was remote and irrelevant. The court ruled:\n       \u201cI don\u2019t think it is remote and it is relevant insofar as it is a theft-related offense.\nIt goes to credibility so I will allow the impeachment. Obviously because it\u2019s a\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fmisdemeanor you have to ask about the conduct as opposed to the conviction, [defense\ncounsel].\u201d\n       Defendant did not cross-examine Maria regarding the facts underlying her prior\ntheft conviction.\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       Theft is a crime of moral turpitude, relevant to a witness\u2019s credibility. (People v.\nMendoza (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th 918, 925.) Prior to 1996, moral turpitude relating to\nmisdemeanors had to be proven through evidence of the underlying conduct, as the\nconviction itself was inadmissible hearsay. (Wheeler, supra, 4 Cal.4th at pp. 298-299.)\nAs noted above, after the decision in Wheeler, the legislature has made misdemeanor\nconvictions admissible to prove both \u201cthe fact of conviction, [and] \u2026 that the offense\nreflected in the record occurred\u201d under an exception to the hearsay rule. (Duran, supra,\n97 Cal.App.4th at p. 1461; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 452.5.)\n       Defendant argues the trial court\u2019s ruling demonstrates that the court failed to take\ninto account the change in the law permitting admission of the misdemeanor conviction,\nrather than limiting proof to the underlying conduct. While the court\u2019s comments are\narguably susceptible to defendant\u2019s interpretation, the point is not entirely clear, as\ndefense counsel did not cite Evidence Code section 452.5 or Duran, supra, 97\nCal. App. 4th 1448, at the hearing on admissibility of the theft prior conviction.\n       In any event, error, if any, was harmless. Defendant did not even cross-examine\nMaria about the conduct leading to the prior conviction. As set forth in detail earlier, the\nevidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. Given the state of the record, we\ncannot envision any circumstance in which admission of the relatively trivial fact of\nMaria\u2019s prior conviction could reasonably have lead to a result more favorable to\ndefendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fProsecutorial Misconduct\n\n\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing\nargument, by characterizing documents that defendant referred to while testifying as a\n\u201cscript,\u201d and by questioning defendant regarding the names of his drug dealers and fellow\ndrug users on cross-examination. He further asserts that, as to the prosecutor\u2019s comments\nin summation, the court committed trial error by overruling his objections. The Attorney\nGeneral argues that defendant forfeited the claims by failing to object to the alleged acts\nof misconduct on the same grounds or to request that the jury be admonished to disregard\nthe alleged improprieties, and that the contentions lack merit. We agree with the\nAttorney General.\n       \u201cThe standards governing review of misconduct claims are settled. \u2018A prosecutor\nwho uses deceptive or reprehensible methods to persuade the jury commits misconduct,\nand such actions require reversal under the federal Constitution when they infect the trial\nwith such \u201c\u2018unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019\u201d\n[Citations.] Under state law, a prosecutor who uses such methods commits misconduct\neven when those actions do not result in a fundamentally unfair trial. [Citation.] In order\nto preserve a claim of misconduct, a defendant must make a timely objection and request\nan admonition; only if an admonition would not have cured the harm is the claim of\nmisconduct preserved for review. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Parson (2008) 44\nCal. 4th 332, 359.)\n\n\n       Prosecutor\u2019s Rebuttal Argument\n\n\n              Relevant Proceedings\n\n\n       The record shows that twice during his testimony, defendant looked at documents\nthat he had with him on the witness stand. This first instance occurred during direct\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fexamination, when defendant was giving the location where a conversation he had with\nDiedra took place:\n       \u201c[Defense counsel:] Now, after she said, you know, take care of me and I\u2019ll take\ncare of you, what happened next?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] Got to the \u2013 J \u2013 is that 4 \u2013 J-4.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Your Honor, I\u2019m sorry, is he referring to something?\n       \u201c[The Court:] He is. He does appear to have some sort of booklet up here,\ncounsel, that he\u2019s referring to. [\u00b6] Sir, if you are going to refresh your recollection with\nanything, you need to let me know that you are refreshing your recollection and, counsel,\nyou are both entitled to look at whatever it is that he is refreshing his recollection with, if\nyou care to do so.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] I would like to. Thank you.\n       \u201c[Defense counsel:] Yeah.\n       (Brief pause in the proceedings.)\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] I would just ask that we place this out of his view. If he needs it \u2013\n       \u201c[Defense counsel:] That\u2019s fine. If he needs something, he can ask.\u201d\n       Later, on cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant if he needed to refer\nto the papers to refresh his recollection of his father\u2019s address:\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] What is his address?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] I got it in my book.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Would you like to look at your book?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] Yes.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Would it refresh your recollection?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] You said what\u2019s my pop\u2019s address?\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Yes.\n       \u201c[Defendant:] I have it in my folder.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] With the Court\u2019s permission.\n       \u201c[The Court:] Sure.\n(Brief pause in the proceedings.)\n\n                                              26\n\f       \u201c[Defendant:] You want the phone number too?\n       \u201c[The Court:] She just asked for the address.\n       \u201c[Defendant provides address.]\u201d\n       In her rebuttal summation, the prosecutor referred to the papers defendant had\nconsulted:\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Again, the defendant [was] willfully false when he testified. In\nfact he had to have his story written down in his little book that he brought up to the\nwitness stand and would have kept looking at the book had I not noticed him looking\ndown every time he needed to confirm his statement or answer, and the judge actually\nsaw that he had his book out and he was referring to it where he had his little script for\nhis testimony.\n       \u201c[Defense counsel:] Your Honor, objection; misstates; not in evidence.\n       \u201c[The Court:] Overruled.\u201d\n\n\n              Analysis\n\n\n       Defendant forfeited his argument that the prosecutor committed misconduct by\ncharacterizing the papers he consulted as a \u201cscript.\u201d Defense counsel objected on the\nbasis that the argument \u201cmisstates; not in evidence.\u201d He did not object on the basis that\nthe prosecutor\u2019s argument rose to the level of misconduct, nor did he request an\nadmonition. The issue was not preserved for review. (See People v. Alfaro (2007) 41\nCal. 4th 1277, 1328 (Alfaro).)\n       This is not a case where the prosecutor\u2019s actions rendered the trial fundamentally\nunfair or where an admonition would not have cured the alleged harm. \u201c[W]hen the\nclaim focuses upon comments made by the prosecutor before the jury, the question is\nwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the\ncomplained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.\u201d (People v. Morales (2001) 25\nCal. 4th 34, 44 (Morales).) \u201cProsecutors have wide latitude to discuss and draw\ninferences from the evidence at trial. (People v. Lucas (1995) 12 Cal. 4th 415, 473.)\n\n                                             27\n\fWhether the inferences the prosecutor draws are reasonable is for the jury to decide. (Id.\nat p. 474.) Harsh and vivid attacks on the credibility of opposing witnesses are permitted,\nand counsel can argue from the evidence that a witness\u2019s testimony is unsound,\nunbelievable, or even a patent lie. (People v. Arias (1996) 13 Cal. 4th 92, 162.) . . . [W]e\nmust view the [prosecutor\u2019s] statements in the context of the argument as a whole.\n(People v. Lucas, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 475.)\u201d (People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal. 4th 468,\n522.)\n        We cannot conclude there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have\n\u201cconstrued or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.\u201d\n(Morales, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 44.) The record shows that defendant consulted the\ndocuments twice to refresh his memory as to specific locations. Although the prosecutor\nreviewed the documents after the first instance, her reaction before the jury was mild.\nThe court, prosecutor, and defense counsel agreed that the documents would be set aside,\nbut that defendant could use them again if necessary to refresh his recollection. The\ndocuments were removed from defendant\u2019s view, and he continued to testify to the\ndetails of the incidents unaided until he had trouble recalling an address on cross-\nexamination. At that point, the prosecutor volunteered that defendant could refer to the\ndocuments to help him recall the address, and the court allowed defendant to do so. It is\nnot unusual for witnesses to refresh their recollections of matters like times, dates, and\naddresses, as did other witnesses in this case, including Deputy Navarro. It was clear that\nthe trial court sanctioned the use of the documents for this purpose, as it specifically\nstated that defendant was free to view the documents to refresh his recollection. The\nlogical inference for the jury to draw from these facts is that the documents served a\nproper purpose in the trial as a means of assisting a witness in remembering relatively\ninnocuous facts.\n        The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were a fleeting passage in the context of her entire\nclosing argument. Prosecutors are permitted and expected to attack the credibility of\nwitnesses for the defense, including the defendant. A reasonable juror would have\nrecognized that the prosecutor\u2019s single reference to a \u201cscript,\u201d was a platitude used to\n\n                                             28\n\fsupport her position. The jurors were instructed that they must \u201cdetermine what facts\nhave been proved from the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source,\u201d\n(CALJIC No. 1.00), and that \u201c[s]tatements made by the attorneys during the trial are not\nevidence\u201d (CALJIC No. 1.02). Jurors are presumed to be intelligent and capable of\ncorrectly understanding the court\u2019s instructions. (People v. Lewis (2001) 26 Cal. 4th 334,\n390; People v. Sanchez (2001) 26 Cal. 4th 834, 852.) We presume the jury followed its\ninstructions here, and there is not a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have\n\u201cconstrued or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.\u201d\n(Morales, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 44.) There was no prosecutorial misconduct with\nrespect to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.\n       Defendant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding the court\u2019s knowledge\nof the substance of the documents lent credence to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of\nthe documents as a \u201cscript.\u201d He contends that the court committed trial error by\noverruling his objections and allowing the jury to believe that the court agreed with the\nprosecutor\u2019s assessment. This contention fails for the same reasons. The court allowed\ndefendant to consult the documents to refresh his memory of dates. Had the court\nbelieved defendant was reading a \u201cscript,\u201d it would not have permitted defendant to\nconsult them. The logical inference is that the court did not believe that the documents\nwere improper or a \u201cscript.\u201d\n\n\n       Cross-Examination Regarding Drug Dealers and Users\n\n\n              Relevant Proceedings\n\n\n       On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned defendant about the names of the\npeople who sold him the crack cocaine he claimed to have been using in September of\n2012, when the incidents with Tammy and Diedra occurred:\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Where did you get the crack [cocaine]?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] I bought it.\n\n                                            29\n\f      \u201c[Prosecutor:] From who?\n      \u201c[Defendant:] Certain individuals.\n      \u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection; relevance.\n      \u201c[The Court:] I\u2019m sorry?\n      \u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection; relevance.\n      \u201c[The Court:] Overruled.\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] You can answer.\n      \u201c[Defendant:] A certain individual.\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] Who?\n      \u201c[Defendant:] Whoever.\n      \u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection; relevance.\n      \u201c[The Court:] Overruled.\n      \u201c[Defendant:] I don\u2019t know his name.\u201d\n      Later, the prosecutor questioned defendant about the names of the people he\nclaimed to have been using drugs with prior to picking up Diedra:\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] Who were they?\n      \u201c[Defendant:] Some people I knew.\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] Who were they?\n      \u201c[Defendant:] Someone I knew.\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] What are their names?\n      \u201c[Defendant:] I don\u2019t know their real names.\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] How did you know them?\n      \u201c[Defendant:] I know them by street names.\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] What names?\n      \u201c[Defendant:] I\u2019m not giving any names up.\n      \u201c[The Court:] Sir, I\u2019m going to order you to answer the question.\n      \u201c[Prosecutor:] I don\u2019t know the names. I don\u2019t know the names.\n      \u201c[The Court:] She asked you what names you knew them by.\n      \u201c[Defendant:] One name Rock.\n\n                                            30\n\f       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Who else?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] The other one named Eight.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] Eight?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] Eight.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] As in the number?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] Yes.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] What is the female\u2019s name?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] I never knew her name.\n       \u201c[Prosecutor:] And you were doing crack with them?\n       \u201c[Defendant:] Right.\u201d\n\n\n              Analysis\n\n\n       Again, defendant forfeited his claim by failing to object on the ground of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial, and by failing to request an admonition. (See Alfaro,\nsupra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 1328.) The only objections he made were related to the\nquestioning about his drug dealers, and those objections were based on relevance.\nDefendant\u2019s contention would fail even if it had been preserved, however, as the\nprosecutor did nothing improper.\n       \u201c\u2018[W]hen a defendant voluntarily testifies in his own defense the People may\n\u201cfully amplify his testimony by inquiring into the facts and circumstances surrounding his\nassertions, or by introducing evidence through cross-examination which explains or\nrefutes his statements or the inferences which may necessarily be drawn from them.\u201d\n[Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Reynolds (1984) 152 Cal. App. 3d 42, 46 (Reynolds).)\n\u201c[T]he right of cross-examination takes on added significance where the witness\u2019s\ncredibility is of special significance to the proceedings.\u201d (People v. Seminoff (2008) 159\nCal. App. 4th 518, 526-527.) \u201cA [d]efendant\u2019s refusal to answer relevant questions . . . .\ndeprive[s] the prosecution its right to subject that claim to \u2018the greatest legal engine ever\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\finvented for the discovery of truth,\u2019 cross-examination. [Citation.]\u201d (Reynolds, supra, at\np. 46.)\n          In this case, Tammy and Diedra both testified that they encountered defendant\nbecause he offered assistance when they were alone and in need of help. Neither woman\ntestified to being with defendant for any other purpose, or to voluntarily engaging in\nillicit activities while in defendant\u2019s company. Neither consented to any sexual activity\nwith defendant. In contrast, defendant testified that both women got into his van because\nthey were prostitutes who wanted to use drugs with him, and exchange sex for drugs.\nAccording to defendant, any sexual activities that occurred were consensual.\nDefendant\u2019s testimony that he was in possession of drugs offered an alternate explanation\nas to why Tammy and Diedra would get into a van with a strange man at night. His\ntestimony that Diedra became furious with him when they ran out of drugs provided a\npossible motive for her to lie about being raped. Credibility was a central issue in the\ncase, and defendant brought his own credibility into question by choosing to testify to his\nversion of events. Who he obtained the drugs from and who he used them with were\nrelevant questions that defendant should have been readily able to answer if he was\ntestifying truthfully.\n          Although defendant may have legitimately feared retaliation from the \u201cdrug\nunderworld\u201d as he claims, he is not exempted from cross-examination on that basis.\n(See, e.g., Reynolds, supra, 152 Cal.App.3d at p. 46 [\u201cno legal exemption from cross-\nexamination\u201d due to fear that other inmates would label defendant a snitch if he named\nthem].) The prosecutor properly questioned defendant on the circumstances surrounding\nthe two rapes. There was no misconduct.\n\n\nCumulative Prejudicial Error\n\n\n          Defendant contends the cumulative prejudicial effect of the alleged errors raised\nabove requires the reversal of his conviction. We have rejected defendant\u2019s claims of\nerror, except one in which the record is ambiguous and the purported error was so trivial\n\n                                               32\n\fas to not warrant a discussion of the merits. Defendant\u2019s trial was not fundamentally\nunfair. (See People v. Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal. 4th 900, 1056.)\n\n\nEvidence Supporting One of Defendant\u2019s Recidivist Prior Convictions Enhancements\n\n\n       Defendant contends that one of the five-year enhancements for prior serious\nfelony convictions must be stricken. He argues that two of the prior charges\u2014rape (\u00a7\n261, subd. (a)(2)) and rape in concert (\u00a7 264.1)\u2014were not brought and tried separately.\nThe Attorney General concedes the issue, and we agree. 4\n       Section 667, subdivision (a)(1) provides: \u201c[A]ny person convicted of a serious\nfelony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony in this state or of any\noffense committed in another jurisdiction which includes all of the elements of any\nserious felony, shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the\npresent offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges\nbrought and tried separately. The terms of the present offense and each enhancement\nshall run consecutively.\u201d \u201cBrought and tried separately\u201d means that \u201cthe underlying\nproceedings must have been formally distinct, from filing to adjudication of guilt.\u201d (In re\nHarris (1989) 49 Cal. 3d 131, 136; People v. Wagner (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 729, 737).\n\u201c[A] court may look to the record of conviction to determine whether the defendant\u2019s\nprior serious felony convictions were sustained \u2018on charges brought and tried separately .\n. . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Wilson (2013) 219 Cal. App. 4th 500, 510.)\n       In this case, the prosecutor introduced into evidence two section 969, subdivision\n(b) packets from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The evidence\nrelating to defendant\u2019s prior convictions for rape and rape in concert consisted of an\nabstract of judgment and an information. The abstract of judgment shows that defendant\nwas convicted of one count of rape and one count of rape in concert on May 8, 1991, in\n\n\n\n       4\n       Defendant does not challenge the section 667, subdivision (a)(1) enhancement\nimposed on the basis of his prior robbery conviction (\u00a7 211) in case number A765883.\n\n                                             33\n\fcase number MA002638. Further proof that the two rape charges were not brought and\ntried separately is found in the felony information in case No. MA002638. Defendant\nwas charged in that information in count 1 with forcible rape while acting in concert and\nin count 2 with forcible rape.\n       Based on this evidence, defendant was convicted and sentenced for rape and rape\nin concert in the same proceeding. Because these prior felonies were not brought and\ntried separately, the trial court upon issuance of the remittitur must dismiss one of the\nfive-year enhancements stemming from case No. MA002638 and issue an amended\nabstract of judgment reflecting the change.\n\n\nImposition of Consecutive Sentences for Criminal Threats\n\n\n       Defendant contends the sentences imposed on the charges of criminal threats in\ncounts 4 and 6 must be stayed because the threats were part of the force and fear used for\nthe underlying sexual assaults against Tammy and Diedra. We agree that the sentence\nimposed in count 6 must be stayed pursuant to section 654. Section 654 does not require\nthat the sentence imposed in count 4 be stayed, however, as substantial evidence supports\nthe trial court\u2019s implied finding that defendant\u2019s course of conduct was divisible.\n       Section 654, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAn act or omission that\nis punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the\nprovision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case\nshall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.\u201d In Neal v. State of\nCalifornia (1960) 55 Cal. 2d 11 (Neal), our Supreme Court \u201cexpanded the meaning of\nsection 654 to apply to more than one criminal act when there is a course of conduct that\nviolates more than one statute but nevertheless constitutes an indivisible transaction.\u201d\n(People v. Hairston (2009) 174 Cal. App. 4th 231, 240.) In determining whether a course\nof conduct consisting of multiple acts is indivisible, we look to the \u201cdefendant\u2019s intent\nand objective.\u201d (People v. Harrison (1989) 48 Cal. 3d 321, 335.) \u201c[I]f all of the offenses\nwere merely incidental to, or were the means of accomplishing or facilitating one\n\n                                              34\n\fobjective, defendant may be found to have harbored a single intent and therefore may be\npunished only once.\u201d (Ibid.) On the other hand, \u201c[i]f [the defendant] entertained\nmultiple criminal objectives which were independent of and not merely incidental to each\nother, he may be punished for independent violations committed in pursuit of each\nobjective even though the violations shared common acts or were parts of an otherwise\nindivisible course of conduct.\u201d (People v. Beamon (1973) 8 Cal. 3d 625, 639.)\n       \u201c[S]ection 654 serves to match a defendant\u2019s culpability with punishment.\u201d\n(People v. Yang Vang (2010) 184 Cal. App. 4th 912, 915.) \u201c[D]ecisions . . . have refined\nand limited application of the \u2018one intent and objective\u2019 test, in part because of concerns\nthat the test often defeats its own purpose because it does not necessarily ensure that a\ndefendant\u2019s punishment will be commensurate with his culpability.\u201d (People v. Kwok\n(1998) 63 Cal. App. 4th 1236, 1253.) As our Supreme Court noted in People v. Latimer\n(1993) 5 Cal. 4th 1203, 1211-1212, the cases following Neal have \u201climited the rule\u2019s\napplication in various ways,\u201d including, in some cases, by \u201cnarrowly interpret[ing] the\nlength of time the defendant had a specific objective, and thereby [concluding] similar\nbut consecutive objectives permit[ed] multiple punishment.\u201d Under such circumstances,\n\u201c[i]f the separation in time afforded [the] defendant[] an opportunity to reflect and to\nrenew [his] intent before committing the next crime, a new and separate crime [wa]s\ncommitted.\u201d (People v. Louie (2012) 203 Cal. App. 4th 388, 399.)\n       \u201cThe question whether section 654 is factually applicable to a given series of\noffenses is for the trial court, and the law gives the trial court broad latitude in making\nthis determination. Its findings on this question must be upheld on appeal if there is any\nsubstantial evidence to support them. [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Hutchins (2001) 90\nCal. App. 4th 1308, 1312 (Hutchins).) \u201cWhen a trial court sentences a defendant to\nseparate terms without making an express finding the defendant entertained separate\nobjectives, the trial court is deemed to have made an implied finding each offense had a\nseparate objective.\u201d (People v. Islas (2012) 210 Cal. App. 4th 116, 129.) \u201c\u2018\u201cWe must\n\u2018view the evidence in a light most favorable to the respondent and presume in support of\nthe [sentencing] order the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from\n\n                                              35\n\fthe evidence.

App. 4th 612, 627.)\n\n\n       Criminal Threats Against Tammy (Count 6)\n\n\n       With respect to Tammy, the jury convicted defendant in count 5 of assault with\nintent to commit rape or oral copulation and in count 6 of criminal threats. The trial court\nimposed separate, consecutive sentences, stating: \u201cIn terms of the victim in count 5 and\ncount 6, again between the assault with the knife and the threat being made for the\n[section] 422 and also the actual assault and kidnaping type behavior, there is enough\ntime and space that separates each of those things to just [sic] the consecutive term.\u201d\n       Making criminal threats is a specific intent crime that occurs when the defendant\n\u201cwillfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to\nanother person, with the specific intent that the statement . . . is to be taken as a threat,\neven if there is no intent of actually carrying it out . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 422.) Section 422 was\nenacted to punish those who try to instill fear in others. (People v. Felix (2001) 92\nCal. App. 4th 905, 913.) The intent required by section 422 is not the intent to actually\ncarry out the threatened crime, but the intent that the victim receive and understand the\nthreat. (People v. Wilson (2010) 186 Cal. App. 4th 789, 806.)\n       Assault with intent to commit rape or oral copulation is an \u201cunlawful attempt,\ncoupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another\u201d (\u00a7\n240) with the intent to commit either rape or orally copulation the victim (\u00a7 220, subd.\n(a)(1)). \u201cOrdinarily, \u2018[a]n assault occurs whenever \u201c\u2018[t]he next movement would, at least\nto all appearance, complete the battery.\u2019\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] But there can also be\nan assault when the battery is only threatened. [Citation.] \u2018\u201cWhere a party puts in a\ncondition which must be at once performed, and which condition he has no right to\nimpose, and his intent is immediately to enforce performance by violence, and he places\nhimself in a position to do so, and proceeds as far as it is then necessary for him to go in\norder to carry out his intention, then it is as much an assault as if he actually struck, or\n\n                                               36\n\fshot, at the other party, and missed him.\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Page (2004) 123\nCal. App. 4th 1466, 1473 (Page).)\n       In this case, the prosecutor relied on a conditional threat theory of assault, and the\njury was accordingly instructed under CALJIC 9.00.1, which applies to cases in which a\nconditional threat constitutes the assault.5 In convicting defendant pursuant to section\n240, the jury necessarily found that defendant intended to threaten Tammy for the\npurpose of committing oral copulation or rape. No evidence was presented that\ndefendant had an objective in committing criminal threats that was not also his objective\nin committing assault with intent to commit rape or oral copulation, so we cannot\nconclude that the crimes were not part of a single course of conduct on this basis.\n       Additionally, there was no temporal separation between the two crimes. Tammy\ntestified that the entire incident occurred very quickly: Defendant got out of the driver\u2019s\nseat, put his leg between her legs, and put his hand around her throat. He held something\nsharp to her neck and said, \u201cBitch, get in the back and get naked.\u201d Tammy asked if he\nwas joking, and he immediately responded, \u201cBitch, get in the back and get naked;\notherwise, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Defendant set the sharp object down behind the seat, but picked\nit up and held it to her neck again when Tammy reached for the door. He again said,\n\u201cBitch, get in the back and get naked; otherwise I\u2019m going to stab you.\u201d When defendant\nput the sharp object down a second time, Tammy was able to escape and get help.\n       On these facts, there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that\nthe crimes were divisible for purposes of section 654, as there does not appear to be a\n\n\n\n\n       5 The jury was instructed that: \u201cAn assault includes a conditional threat to apply\nphysical force upon another, providing that: [\u00b6] 1. The threat commands the immediate\nperformance of some act which the threatening party has no legal right to demand; [\u00b6] 2.\nThe threat is made with the intention of compelling performance of that act by the\napplication of physical force; [\u00b6] 3. The person making the threat has placed himself\nphysically in a position to inflict such physical force; and [\u00b6] 4. That person has\nproceeded as far as it is necessary to go in order to carry out his intention.\u201d\n\n\n                                              37\n\fseparation between the threats and the assault. Defendant\u2019s sentence in count 6 must\ntherefore be stayed.\n\n\n       Criminal Threats Against Diedra (Count 4)\n\n\n       With respect to Diedra, the jury convicted defendant in count 1 of forcible rape, in\ncounts 2 and 3 of forcible oral copulation, and in count 4 of criminal threats. The trial\ncourt imposed separate, consecutive sentences without discussing why the sentence in\ncount 4 was not stayed pursuant to section 654.\n       Forcible rape \u201cis an act of sexual intercourse . . . accomplished against a person\u2019s\nwill by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful\nbodily injury on the person or another.\u201d (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2).) \u201cOral copulation is the act\nof copulating the mouth of one person with the sexual organ or anus of another person\u201d\n(\u00a7 288a, subd. (a)), \u201caccomplished against the victim\u2019s will by means of force, violence,\nduress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another\nperson . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(2)). Within the context of sexual offenses, \u201c\u2018duress\u2019\nmeans a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution sufficient to\ncoerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which otherwise\nwould not have been performed, or acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not\nhave submitted.\u201d (\u00a7 261, subd. (b).) \u201c\u2018[M]enace\u2019 means any threat, declaration, or act\nwhich shows an intention to inflict an injury upon another.\u201d (\u00a7 261, subd. (c).)\n       Defendant threatened Diedra before he committed the sexual offenses and again\nafterwards. His initial use of threats to accomplish the rape and oral copulations was\nnecessary to the jury\u2019s finding that those crimes were forcible, and no evidence was\npresented that he had an objective in making those threats that was not also his objective\nin committing the sexual offenses. However, defendant\u2019s final threat\u2014that he would cut\nDiedra\u2019s throat and watch her bleed if she did not orally copulate him again because he\nliked watching \u201cbitches bleed\u201d\u2014was made after the sexual offenses were completed, and\nnecessarily could not have been for the same objective. Defendant\u2019s stated intention was\n\n                                             38\n\fto commit another sexual offense or to cause Diedra bodily harm, which increased his\nculpability. There was substantial evidence to support imposition of a separate sentence.\n       Additionally, the crimes defendant committed against Diedra occurred over a\nsignificant period of time, with numerous breaks: After Diedra complied with his initial\nthreats and undressed, defendant stopped and told her he wanted to look at her. He took\nthe time to light a lighter to see her, and asked her how old she was before making her get\ninto the back of the van. Defendant then made Diedra orally copulate him for \u201ca long\ntime,\u201d during which he repositioned himself multiple times. He stopped and talked to\nDiedra when she began crying and asked to be let go. When defendant demanded to\norally copulate Diedra, she did not immediately comply, saying she was scared and\nrefusing to lie down. While defendant orally copulated Diedra, he again talked to her,\ntelling her that he would let her go when she was finished. After demanding sexual\nintercourse, defendant stopped to obtain and put on a condom. When defendant\ndemanded oral sex again, and Diedra was crying too much to orally copulate him,\ndefendant again stopped. He gave her his shirt to blow her nose, and asked her to sit next\nto him and talk to him. He said he would let her go after she finished. Defendant gave\nDiedra her bra and shirt, and allowed her time to put her bra on. He did not threaten\nDiedra again until she asked for her pants.\n       These facts support the finding that there were periods of time between the crimes\nin which defendant stopped and was able to reflect and form a new criminal intent.\nInstead of taking the opportunity to cease his prolonged attack, defendant proceeded to\nmake an additional threat instead. We conclude the trial court\u2019s implicit determination\nthat defendant had a separate objective in count 4 is supported by substantial evidence.\nAccordingly, the imposition of separate punishment for criminal threats against Diedra\nwas appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                              39\n\fEvidence Supporting Criminal Threats in Count 6\n\n\n       Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for\ncriminal threats in count 6 because Tammy was not in reasonable sustained fear for her\nown safety. There is no merit to this contention.\n       The Fifth and Sixth Amendments, which apply to the states through the Fourteenth\nAmendment, require the prosecution to prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. (Sullivan v. Louisiana (1993) 508 U.S. 275, 277-278.) A conviction supported by\ninsufficient evidence violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and\nmust be reversed. (Jackson v. Virginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 317-319.) The same is true\nof enhancements. (People v. Albillar (2010) 51 Cal. 4th 47, 59-60 (Albillar).) \u201c\u2018When\nconsidering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we\nreview the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether\nit contains substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of\nsolid value\u2014from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond\na reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal. 4th 680, 701.)\n       Pursuant to section 422, a person is guilty of criminal threats if he \u201cwillfully\nthreatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another\nperson, with the specific intent that the statement . . . is to be taken as a threat, even if\nthere is no intent of actually carrying it out, which, on its face and under the\ncircumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and\nspecific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate\nprospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in\nsustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety.\u201d\n       To establish the \u201csustained fear\u201d element, \u201cthe statute . . . requires proof of a\nmental element in the victim.\u201d (People v. Allen (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1149, 1156\n(Allen).) \u201cSustained fear\u201d is fear that is more than \u201cmomentary, fleeting, or transitory.\u201d\n(Ibid.) The fear must also be reasonable. (\u00a7 422; People v. Toledo (2001) 26 Cal. 4th\n221, 227-228.)\n\n                                               40\n\f       Defendant argues that Tammy was not in sustained fear because she left the scene\nquickly, and did not look back to see if defendant was pursuing her. He asserts that she\nwas no longer in danger after running a few blocks because there was no evidence that\ndefendant had a long-range weapon or that he could find her in the future. We disagree.\n       Defendant assaulted Tammy with the intent of raping her or subjecting her to oral\ncopulation. Even defendant does not appear to contest that from the moment Tammy\nunderstood what was happening until she was able to escape the van she was terrified.\nShe testified she was \u201cscared to death\u201d as she thought of a way to escape the van.\nTammy was so afraid that she did not retrieve her gas can, lost her sandals while running,\nand continued to run barefoot in an industrial area. She tried desperately to flag down\nanyone she could, but could not get anyone to stop, so she ran barefoot for over a half of\na mile past closed businesses to reach the Panda Express, where she banged on the door\nfor the women inside to call 911. Although they called the police for her, they would not\nlet her inside, so she waited outside, in the dark, for 45 minutes for the police to arrive.\nWhen Deputy Forbes arrived, Tammy was out of breath, crying, and hysterical. Her hair\nwas \u201cmessed up,\u201d and she didn\u2019t have any shoes on. There was ample evidence that\nTammy was subjectively afraid the entire time, which was close to an hour. The jury\ncould reasonably conclude that an hour spent in fear of being sexually assaulted or killed\nis more than \u201cmomentary, fleeting, or transitory.\u201d Our courts have upheld convictions for\ncriminal threats where the duration of the sustained fear was substantially less. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Fierro (2010) 180 Cal. App. 4th 1342, 1349 [victim in sustained fear for\napproximately 15 minutes]; Allen, supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1156 [same].)\n       This same evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s finding that Tammy\u2019s fear was\nreasonable. Substantial evidence supports defendant\u2019s conviction for criminal threats in\ncount 6.\n\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\fEvidence Supporting Weapon Enhancements\n\n\n       Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to support the weapon\nenhancements (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)) appended to the charges relating to Tammy in\ncounts 5 and 6. We apply the traditional substantial evidence standard of review in\ndetermining the sufficiency of the evidence to support enhancements. (Albillar, supra,\n51 Cal.4th at pp. 59-60.)\n       Section 12022, subdivision (b)(1) provides that: \u201cA person who personally uses a\ndeadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be\npunished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for\none year, unless use of a deadly or dangerous weapon is an element of that offense.\u201d To\nfind a deadly weapon allegation true, the trier of fact must conclude that \u201cthe defendant\nhimself intentionally displayed an instrument capable of inflicting great bodily injury or\ndeath in a menacing manner during the crime.\u201d (In re Bartholomew D. (2005) 131\nCal. App. 4th 317, 322.) Defendant does not dispute using an object during the\ncommission of the offenses against Tammy, but argues there was insufficient evidence to\nestablish the object was a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n       Deadly weapons can include objects which \u201cmay be used as weapons but which\nhave nondangerous uses, such as hammers and pocket knives.\u201d (People v. Burton (2006)\n143 Cal. App. 4th 447, 457.) Circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to establish the\ndeadly nature of an object. (People v. Monjaras (2008) 164 Cal. App. 4th 1432, 1436\n(Monjaras).) This includes a defendant\u2019s own words and conduct in the course of the\noffense. (Id. at pp. 1436-1437.) It is not necessary that the victim see the weapon, but\nonly that \u201cby sensory perception, the victim is made aware of its presence.\u201d (People v.\nJacobs (1987) 193 Cal. App. 3d 375, 381 [holding that a firearm was displayed when\nvictim was made aware of its presence by a the sound of the hammer being cocked].)\n       Tammy testified that defendant held \u201cwhat [she] thought was a knife to [her] neck,\nsomething sharp . . . . [\u00b6] [\u00b6] [\u00b6] [\u00b6] right behind her earline\u201d It was dark in the van so\nTammy could not see what defendant was holding. Defendant threatened, \u201cBitch, get in\n\n                                            42\n\fthe back and get naked; otherwise, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Defendant put what Tammy thought\nwas a knife down behind him, but when she reached for the door he picked it up again\nand held it to her neck. He threatened, \u201cBitch, get in the back and get naked; otherwise\nI\u2019m going to stab you.\u201d\n       When questioned further about the object defendant used, Tammy described the\nsensation she felt as \u201ca point, something that was pointy or sharp pushing into the back of\nmy neck.\u201d She could not tell what it was made of, but when defendant put the object\ndown the second time, she thought \u201cit might not be a knife because it wasn\u2019t shiny or\nsomething like that.\u201d She could not see the object to know for certain.\n       Defendant\u2019s actions and words indicated that the sharp object he held to Tammy\u2019s\nneck could cause great bodily injury, specifically that he could kill or stab her with it.\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that a pointed object aimed at the victim\u2019s neck is capable of\nproducing death or great bodily injury.\u201d (In re Brandon T. (2011) 191 Cal. App. 4th 1491,\n1497; see also Page, supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1469, 1472 [\u201c\u2018sharp[,] pointy\u2019\u201d pencil\nheld a deadly weapon].) \u201cThe jury was not required to give defendant the benefit of\n[Tammy\u2019s] inability to say conclusively [what the object was] . . . because \u2018defendant\u2019s\nown words and conduct in the course of an offense may support a rational fact finder\u2019s\ndetermination that he used a [deadly weapon].\u2019\u201d (Monjaras, supra, 164 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1436-1437, quoting People v. Rodriguez (1999) 20 Cal. 4th 1, 13.) \u201c[T]he jury was\nentitled to take defendant at his word, so to speak, and infer from his conduct that the\n[object was a dangerous weapon] and that he was prepared to [use it] if [Tammy] did not\ncomply with his demand.\u201d (Monjaras, supra, at p. 1437.) Substantial evidence supports\nthe jury\u2019s finding that defendant used a dangerous or deadly weapon in commission of\ncounts 5 and 6.\n\n\nErrors in the Abstract of Judgment\n\n\n       Our review of the record disclosed that the abstract of judgment did not conform\nto the oral pronouncement of judgment as to counts 1-3. At the sentencing hearing on\n\n                                              43\n\fMarch 21, 2014, the trial court orally imposed consecutive terms in counts 1-3 of 25-\nyears-to-life pursuant to the one strike law, tripled to 75-years-to-life under the three\nstrikes law, plus an enhancement of 15 years for three prior serious felony convictions.\nThe abstract of judgment omits any reference to section 667.61\u2014the one strike law\u2014and\nincorrectly reflects the indeterminate terms imposed by the trial court as 25-years-to-life\nfor counts 1-3. We invited the parties to submit further briefing on this issue.\n       Defendant contends that the abstract of judgment \u201cappears\u201d to properly reflect the\ntrial court\u2019s oral pronouncement of judgment on these points, albeit in a round-about\nfashion through cross-reference. The Attorney General contends that the abstract of\njudgment does not conform to the court\u2019s oral pronouncement and must be corrected.\n       We agree with the Attorney General that the abstract of judgment does not\naccurately reflect the trial court\u2019s oral pronouncement, but even if we were to accept\ndefendant\u2019s interpretation, it is clear from our review and from the responses that, at best,\nthe meaning of the abstract of judgment on these points is unclear and confusing. The\nabstract of judgment must be modified to clearly reflect the oral pronouncement of\njudgment. (See People v. Scott (2012) 203 Cal. App. 4th 1303, 1324 [\u201cit is the oral\npronouncement of sentence that constitutes the judgment\u201d].) There is no dispute that the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling was clear, and that any discrepancies in the abstract of judgment were\nclerical in nature and may be corrected on appeal. (Ibid. [\u201cdiscrepancies between an\nabstract and the actual judgment as orally pronounced are subject to correction at any\ntime, and should be corrected by a reviewing court when detected on appeal\u201d].)\n       Accordingly, we order the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment to reflect\nthat the sentences in counts 1-3 were imposed under the one strike law (\u00a7 667.61, subds.\n(a) and (d)), as well as the three strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-\n(d)), and that the indeterminate term on those counts is 75-years-to-life.\n\n\n\n\n                                              44\n\f                                       DISPOSITION\n\n\n       The trial court is directed to modify the judgment as to counts 1-6 to reflect that\ndefendant has suffered two prior serious felony convictions pursuant to section 667,\nsubdivision (a), and impose two five-year enhancements on these counts. The abstract of\njudgment is ordered modified to reflect that the sentences imposed in counts 1-3 are\nconsecutive terms of 25-years-to-life pursuant to the one strike law (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (a)\nand (d)), tripled to 75-years-to-life under the three strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i),\n1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), plus two five-year serious felony prior conviction enhancements\n(\u00a7667, subd. (a)(1)), for an aggregate of 85-years-to-life. Additionally, the trial court is\ninstructed to modify the judgment to stay the sentence imposed in count 6 pursuant to\nsection 654. The clerk of the superior court shall send a copy of the corrected abstract of\njudgment to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. As modified, the\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n              KRIEGLER, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n              TURNER, P.
