Kenneth Eugene Allen pled guilty\nto an indictment charging him with possession of crack\ncocaine and an illegal firearm, after his motion to suppress\nevidence seized pursuant to a warrant issued on an allegedly\ninsufficient affidavit was denied by the district court. He\nappealed that denial. A panel of this court ruled that the\naffidavit was insufficient to provide probable cause for the\nwarrant, and reversed his conviction. United States v. Allen,\n168 F.3d 293 (6th Cir. 1999). We granted a rehearing en\nbanc, and now hold that an affidavit based upon personal\nobservation of criminal activity by a confidential informant\nwho has been named to the magistrate and who, as the\naffidavit avers, has provided reliable information to the police\nin the past about criminal activity, though without further\nspecificity as to the type of such activity, can be sufficient for\na magistrate to find probable cause to issue a warrant. We\naffirm the district court\u2019s denial of Allen\u2019s motion to suppress\nevidence, and Allen\u2019s subsequent conviction.\n\fNo. 96-6313                        United States v. Allen         3\n\n                               I\n  On October 11, 1995, Detective Gary Lomenick of the\nChattanooga Police Department received a tip from a\nconfidential informant (\u201cCI\u201d) that a man called Red Dog,\nresiding at 910 North Market Street, was in possession of\ncocaine. Red Dog was familiar to other officers, though not\nto Lomenick, as someone known to be involved with drugs,\nnamed Kenneth Allen. Based on the CI\u2019s information,\nLomenick sought and obtained a search warrant that same\nday. The affidavit read in full as follows:\n    I, Gary Lomenick, a duly sworn Chattanooga Police\n  Officer, hereby apply for a search warrant and make oath\n  as follows:\n    1. I am a sworn Chattanooga Police Officer with the\n  Narcotics Division, where I have been assigned for over\n  15 years, and a commissioned Special Deputy Sheriff for\n  Hamilton County, Tennessee.\n     2. On the 11th day of October 1995 I Gary Lomenick\n  received information from an informant, a responsible\n  and credible citizen of the county and state, who I know\n  to be a responsible and credible citizen because, I have\n  known said informant for 5 years and said informant has\n  given me information about individuals involved in\n  criminal activity in the past that has proven to be reliable.\n  Said informants\u2019s name whom I have this day disclosed\n  to the Judge to whom this application is made, that [sic]\n  John Doe (Alias) Red Dog who resides in or occupies\n  and is in possession of the following described premises\n  910 North Market Street, apartment directly underneath\n  carport located in Chattanooga, Hamilton County\n  Tennessee, unlawfully has in his possession on said\n  premises legend and/or narcotic drugs including Cocaine\n  in violation of law made and provided in such cases.\n    3. On the 11th day of October 1995 said informant\n  advised me that said informant was on the premises of\n  the said John Doe (Alias) Red Dog located at 910 North\n\f4      United States v.

In a motion filed on April\n18, 1996, he moved to suppress the evidence as illegally\nseized, alleging that the indictment was based on an\ninsufficient affidavit, one that did not provide probable cause,   the warrant was applied for and issued prior to the Weaver decision.

We do not agree, however, that these elements\nagrees that the warrant was not supported by probable cause                    should be understood as entirely separate and\nbecause \u201cin the absence of greater specificity, the special                    independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every\njudge who issued the warrant in this case could not have had                   case . . . .
