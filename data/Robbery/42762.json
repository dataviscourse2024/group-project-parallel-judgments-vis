On October 28, 1983, the defendant was sentenced, on the robbery charge, to a term of twenty years, execution suspended after service of fifteen years, and, on the conspiracy to commit robbery charge, to a term of ten years, execution suspended with three years probation.\nOn the day the defendant was sentenced, an application for waiver of fees, costs and expenses and for the appointment of counsel to appeal the judgment of conviction was filed. Despite the appointment of a number of appellate counsel between January, 1984, and February, 1987, nothing was done to perfect the defendant\u2019s appeal. On the basis of the particular facts of this case, the defendant was allowed to file a late appeal.\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the record in this case, we find no error.\nThere is no error.\n",
