CommissionerDocket Nos. 91061, 91062, 91063, 91064, 91065, 91066United States Tax Court43 T.C. 842; 1965 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS 111; March 24, 1965, Filed March 24, 1965, Filed *111 Decisions will be entered under Rule 50.  Held, petitioners have shown on this record by clear evidence that they paid out sums of money to enter into certain tax-avoidance schemes by reason of misrepresentations of M. Eli Livingstone, that they relied upon those misrepresentations and would not have paid out such sums otherwise, that they were thus swindled by Livingstone, and that they are accordingly entitled to deductions for theft losses in 1959, the year in which Livingstone's fraud was discovered by them.  Sec. 165(a), (c)(3), and (e), I.R.C. 1954.  Cyrus A. Neuman, for the petitioners.Kenneth G. Anderson, for the respondent.  Raum, Judge.  RAUM*842  The Commissioner determined deficiencies against petitioners for each of the years 1956 through 1959.  As a result of various concessions the only issue for decision is whether petitioners sustained a theft loss in 1959.FINDINGS OF FACTPerry A. Nichols and Inez Nichols, William C. and Elaine B. Gaither, Walter H., Jr., and Ethel K. Beckham, and William C. and Phoebe Diehl Green were husbands and wives, respectively, residing in Miami, Fla., during the taxable years 1956 through 1959.  William S. and Jean Frates were husband and wife, *112 residing in Miami, Fla., during the taxable years 1956 through 1958.  Each couple filed a joint Federal income tax return for these taxable years with the district director of internal revenue, Jacksonville, Fla.  In addition, William S. Frates filed his Federal income tax return for the taxable year 1959 with the district director of internal revenue, Jacksonville, Fla.  For convenience, the male petitioners will be individually referred to hereinafter as Nichols, Gaither, Green, Beckham, and Frates, and will be collectively referred to as petitioners.For the years 1955 through 1959, the petitioners reported adjusted gross income on their Federal income tax returns, essentially all of which was derived from the private practice of law, in amounts as follows:NicholsGaitherGreenBeckhamFrates1955$ 176,078.37$ 112,264.69$ 118,988.17$ 59,569.69$ 58,401.601956211,377.90145,150.03145,304.22103,773.34101,224.561957150,373.45104,143.16103,915.2197,260.6890,460.931958290,010.04191,464.36200,314.05149,953.40148,471.331959149,665.61113,355.88108,156.46102,469.87100,714.47*843  Nichols, Gaither, Green, Frates, and Beckham were attorneys by profession and were engaged in the private practice of law *113 in Miami, Fla., during the years 1952 through 1960, under the partnership firm name of Nichols, Gaither, Green, Frates, and Beckham.  The members of the partnership insofar as practicable, limited their practice of law to the specialty of negligence cases, civil trials, and workmen's compensation cases.None of the petitioners were dealers in securities nor had any of the petitioners purchased or sold Government securities in substantial amounts prior to December of 1955.These cases concern alleged theft losses discovered by petitioners in 1959.  The alleged losses were incurred when petitioners engaged in three transactions arranged by M. Eli Livingstone in an attempt to reduce their Federal income tax liabilities.The facts concerning the first transaction were found by the Court in Perry A. Nichols, 37 T.C. 772\">37 T.C. 772. The parties have agreed that those findings may be considered stipulated facts herein and they are hereby incorporated by reference.  In addition the parties have filed an extensive stipulation of facts herein together with a supplemental stipulation of facts, which disclose the following:William C. Green also entered the transaction described in the Findings of Fact in Perry A. Nichols, supra, *114 purporting to purchase $ 2 million face amount U.S. Treasury 2 7/8 percent notes due March 15, 1957, with interest coupons payable March 15, 1956, and September 15, 1956, detached. The principal purchase price thereof from Livingstone was $ 1,950,000, which he also purported to borrow from Corporate Finance and Loan Corp. and as to which he purported to pay interest in the amount of $ 80,437.50.  Green's transaction was arranged in the same form as that of petitioners in Perry A. Nichols, supra.Similar letters of instruction, confirmation slips, promissory notes, and similar documents were provided to him by Livingstone, including a $ 65,000 interest-free advance at the inception of the transaction in December of 1955.A proceeding was instituted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, involving income tax matters for William C. and Phoebe D. Green, for the taxable year 1955.  That case was captioned William C. and Phoebe D. Green, Plaintiffs vs. Laurie Tomlinson, district director of internal revenue, Florida District, and Ralph Maxwell, senior collection officer.  Such suit was brought by Green to enjoin collection of taxes for the year 1955, *115 on the basis that a statutory notice of deficiency mailed to Green on April 14, 1959, for such year, was not mailed to the taxpayer's \"last known address\" within the meaning of section 6212(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and that an assessment made for such year by the respondent was therefore invalid.  The court held, on March 17, *844  1960, that such statutory notice of deficiency was neither mailed \"to the taxpayer,\" nor to his \"last known address,\" and that the statutory period of limitations on assessment for such year had therefore expired.  The court also held that the respondent was therefore permanently restrained from collecting a deficiency for the year 1955.  No appeal was taken from the decision of the U.S. District Court.  In his return for the year 1955, Green had claimed a deduction in the amount of $ 80,437.50 for \"interest\" paid to Corporate Finance &amp; Loan Corp.During the years 1956 through 1959, petitioners each entered two additional U.S. Treasury note and U.S. Treasury bond transactions; one in 1956 and one in 1957, in which M. Eli Livingstone was involved.  The 1955 transaction, which was the subject matter of Perry A. Nichols, supra, will be referred to *116 herein sometimes as the \"first transaction.\" The 1956 and 1957 transactions will be sometimes herein referred to as the \"second transaction\" and the \"third transaction,\" respectively.In June of 1956, William C. Gaither and Gerald G. Bolotin met in Chicago, Ill.  At that time, Bolotin proposed to Gaither for his consideration and that of the other petitioners, the \"second transaction.\" Gerald Bolotin was an attorney engaged in practicing law in Chicago, Ill., but in addition, acted as a salesman for M. Eli Livingstone, receiving a commission or \"finder's fee\" for his services.  After their conference in Chicago, Livingstone &amp; Co. (a sole proprietorship of M. Eli Livingstone) addressed a letter to William C. Gaither under date of June 26, 1956, which provided as follows:Livingstone &amp; Company, 10 Post Office Square, BostonJune 26, 1956Mr. William C. Gaither448 Pan American Bank BuildingMiami 32, FloridaDear Mr. Gaither:We are enclosing memoranda indicative of the outcome for joint taxable incomes of $ 75,000.00; $ 125,000.00; and $ 200,000.00 through the short sale of U.S. Treasury Notes and the purchase of U.S. Treasury Bonds.On the assumption that the quantity involved is $ 1,000,000.00 *117 face amount, the procedure is as follows:1. You sell to dealer $ 1,000,000.00 U.S. Treasury 2 7/8% Notes due 6/15/58 at 100 (approximately).2. We will loan you the U.S. Treasury Notes to cover your short sale.3. You now have a credit of approximately $ 1,000,000.00.  This is your money, and may be invested by you.4. With the above proceeds, you purchase for cash $ 1,000,000.00 U.S. Treasury 2 3/8% Bonds due 6/15/58 at approximately 96 5/8.5. This will leave you a credit balance of approximately $ 33,750.00.  This you will deposit with us as collateral for the loan of the 2 7/8% Notes.6. You will also deposit with us as collateral for the loan of the 2 7/8% Notes the bonds which you have purchased.7. You will pay us a premium of $ 9,500.00 per million.*845  8. Your coupon expense on the 2 7/8% Notes will be paid with the cash deposit which you have with us.9. Credit will be given you on the 2 3/8% Bonds.At maturity, the value of the Notes and the Bonds is equal, therefore, your account will be as indicated on the enclosed memorandum.We agree that we will not call for the return of the 2 7/8% Notes which we have loaned you, until June 15, 1958, nor during the intervening period will we call *118 for additional margin or collateral.Nothing in this contract prevents you from tendering the Notes which you owe us, and upon such tender, you are entitled to recover back whatever collateral we may be holding for you.The right of the taxpayer to deduct the expense of a short sale has been determined in the case of Norbert H. Wiesler v. Commissioner (6 TC 1148, Affirmed, 161 Federal Wnd (sic) Series 997, and F. A. Wilson v. Commissioner (Tax Court memo opinion, decision entered into July 24, 1946, Affirmed, 163 Federal, 2nd Series 680, certiorari denied in each case, 332 U.S. 842\">332 U.S. 842). The right of the taxpayer engaged in the business of trading in securities was established.  This was acquiesced in by the Commissioner in the Wiesler Case in 1948.In 1950, the Commissioner in an IT ruling, stated that the Internal Revenue Code, Section 23(a) provides in part that in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions, non-trade or non-business expenses, and I will cite the ruling:\"In the case of an individual, all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for the production or collection of income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance *119 of property held for the production of income.\"Said the Commissioner:\"It is believed that the deductibility of amounts paid in connection with stock borrowed to cover short sales, should be determined by the same standards whether a taxpayer is a trader in securities or is merely an investor.  If amounts so paid by a trader in securities are deductible as trade or business expenses, amounts paid by an investor for the same purpose should be deductible as non-trade or non-business expenses.  In view of the foregoing, it is held that amounts equal to dividends paid by an investor with respect to stock borrowed to cover short sales are allowable deductions under section 23(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Premiums paid by an investor in connection with the acquisition of such stock are also deductible under that section of the Code.\"These are the words of the Commissioner and not of some tax expert who is making a decision favorable or unfavorable to one side or the other.Now, if this applies to stocks, the Commissioner in 1954 issued a ruling that the same principle applies to bonds.  It seems only reasonable and logical that such should be the case.  Section 212, which corresponds *120 to Section 23(a)(2) of the 1939 Code, reads as follows:In the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year --(1) for the production or collection of income;(2) for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income; or(3) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax.-- -- -- --You are incurring no interest expense to carry the bonds which you have purchased as they are merely pledged as collateral and you own them outright.We enclose herewith sample documents illustrative of the steps necessary to consummate the short sale of U.S. Treasury Notes and the purchase of U.S. *846  Treasury Bonds.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call us at any time.  We look forward to being of service to you.Very truly yours,(s) M. Eli LivingstoneM. Eli LivingstoneMEL: hsThereafter, under date of June 28, 1956, Bolotin wrote Gaither further with respect to the second transaction, as follows:June 28, 1956Mr. William C. GaitherPan American Bank BuildingMiami, FloridaDear Bill:I was glad to see you, and I trust you had a pleasant and successful *121 trip.As I advised you, Eli Livingstone and I would both be glad to come down to Miami for a day if you felt it was necessary.I assume you have received the original report I had forwarded to you.I had it forwarded in duplicate so that you and Art both would have a copy.Don't forget that in this current transaction you are getting two years benefit by way of deductions in 1956 and 1957 which accounts for the fact that your total cash outlay is slightly more under this program.We can arrange to stagger the payments if you go into the transaction now on a couple of installments during the course of the year so that you don't have a large amount of cash to outlay at any one time.Please don't hesitate to call me and reverse the charges.Kindest regards,(s) Gerald G. BolotinGerald G. BolotinGGB: LMThereafter, Gaither discussed the \"second transaction\" with Nichols, Green, Frates, and Beckham, and it was concluded that they would enter the \"second transaction.\" They so advised Bolotin and Livingstone.

U.S. Government 2 3/8 percent bonds due June 15, 1958, in face amounts as set forth below.  Each petitioner received a confirmation slip from Livingstone &amp; Co. showing a contract date of July 17, 1956, and payable date of July 18, 1956, reciting that as principal and for its own account Livingstone &amp; Co. had sold, to each of the petitioners, U.S. Treasury 2 3/8 percent bonds of June 15, 1958, with December 15, 1956, and June 15, 1957, coupons detached at a price of 96 5/8.

Petitioners, in fact, owned no such notes, and the transaction was purportedly to be handled as a \"short sale\"  with Livingstone &amp; Co. loaning the notes to petitioners.  Livingstone &amp; Co. did not own any such notes, but it purportedly obtained them for this purpose through a purported purchase from Salomon Bros. on July 17, 1956, at par plus 1/64 plus accrued interest, delivery and payment to be made the following day in New York at Chemical Corn Exchange Bank.The records of Salomon Bros. contain additional confirmation slips dated July 16 and 17, 1956, reciting the sale of U.S. Treasury 2 3/8 percent bonds due June 15, 1958, to Livingstone &amp; Co.  With respect to the confirmation slips dated July 16, 1956, the price shown *134 was 99 2/32 plus 1/64 plus accrued interest, with no coupons detached, and with respect to the confirmation slip dated July 17, 1956, the price shown was 99 2/32, plus accrued interest, with no coupons detached. The records of Salomon Bros. also contain confirmation slips dated July 16, and July 17, 1956, reciting the purchase of U.S. Treasury 2 3/8 percent bonds due June 15, 1958, from Livingstone &amp; Co., at the same prices of 99 2/3 plus 1/64 and 99 2/32, for the slips dated July 16, 1956, and July 17, 1956, respectively.

Under date of July 17, 1956, Chemical issued advice memoranda to Livingstone &amp; Co. reciting that, pursuant to the instructions of Livingstone, it had:(a) Delivered, against payment, to Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 8,500,000 face amount U.S. Treasury 2 3/8 percent (bonds) due June 15, 1958;(b) Received, against payment, from Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 8,500,000 face amount U.S. Treasury 2 3/8 percent bonds due June 15, 1958;(c) Delivered, against payment, to Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 3,500,000 face amount U.S. Treasury 2 7/8 percent notes due June 15, 1958;(d) Delivered, against payment, to Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 2,500,000 face amount U.S. Treasury 2 7/8 percent notes due June 15, 1958;(e) Delivered, against payment, to Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 2,500,000 face amount U.S. Treasury 2 7/8 percent notes due June 15, 1958;(f) Received, against payment, from Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 8,500,000 face amount U.S. Treasury 2 7/8 percent notes due June 15, 1958.For its services, Chemical Bank showed service charges on such advice memoranda of $ 170; $ 70; $ 50; and $ 50.  Under date of July *136 18, 1956, Chemical Bank issued advice memoranda to Livingstone &amp; Co. reciting that, pursuant to the instructions of Livingstone, it had:(a) Delivered, against payment, to Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 3 million face amount U.S. Treasury bonds due June 15, 1958;(b) Received, against payment, from Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler, $ 3 million face amount U.S. Treasury bonds due June 15, 1958;(c) Delivered, against payment, to Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 3 million face amount U.S. Treasury 2 7/8 percent notes due June 15, 1958;(d) Received, against payment, from Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler $ 3 million face amount U.S. Treasury 2 7/8 percent notes due June 15, 1958.For its services, Chemical Bank received fees from Livingstone &amp; Co. of $ 75 and $ 75.In fact, neither the 2 3/8 percent Treasury bonds nor the 2 7/8 percent Treasury notes were delivered at Chemical Bank on July 17 or 18. *857  1956, or at any other time in consummation of the foregoing short sale by Livingstone &amp; Co.  The notes involved in the short sale by petitioners to Salomon Bros. and the notes purportedly purchased by Livingstone &amp; Co. from Salomon Bros. to be lent by Livingstone &amp; Co. to petitioners, in order to enable them to make the short *137 sale, were paired off between Salomon Bros. and Chemical Bank.  As the delivery and receipt instructions to Salomon Bros. and Chemical Bank matched each other in face amount, the orders, in effect, canceled each other.  The securities described above never left the offices of Salomon Bros., nor were they ever in the physical possession of petitioners, Livingstone &amp; Co., Livingstone, nor Chemical Bank.  There was no moment of time when Livingstone &amp; Co. had any control over these securities which it purported to purchase from Salomon, when it could have lent such securities to petitioners for the purpose of making a short sale, nor when it was free to deal with them in any other manner.  Livingstone &amp; Co. made entries purporting to show that petitioners had sold the 2 7/8 percent Treasury notes due June 15, 1958, to Salomon Bros., for which Livingstone showed a credit in its books, and that Livingstone &amp; Co. had loaned such securities to petitioners.  About the same date, the entries in the books of Livingstone &amp; Co. purported to show that petitioners had purchased 2 3/8 percent bonds due June 15, 1958, with 12/15/56 and 6/15/57 interest coupons detached.  Thus, at the beginning of *138 the transaction, after considering the debits to petitioners' accounts for the purchase of the 2 3/8 percent bonds of June 15, 1958, with coupons detached, sale of the 2 7/8 percent notes of June 15, 1958, and \"loans\" from Livingstone, each petitioner theoretically had a balance in his favor at Livingstone &amp; Co., in the following amounts:PetitionerBalanceNichols$ 126,922.81Gaither90,659.15Green90,659.15Frates$ 54,513.32Beckham54,513.32Entries were made in petitioners' accounts at Livingstone &amp; Co. during the period ending December 15, 1958, theoretically charging petitioners for the coupons due to Livingstone &amp; Co. on the \"borrowed\" 2 7/8 percent notes and crediting petitioners with the interest on the 2 3/8 percent bonds, reducing petitioners' accounts with Livingstone &amp; Co., as follows: *858 Coupon dueCoupon dueLivingstonepetitionersDate&amp; Co. onon 2 3/8Balanceborrowed 2 7/8percent bondspercent notesNICHOLS7/17/56$ 126,922.8112/15/56$ 50,312.5076,610.316/15/5750,312.5026,297.8112/15/5750,312.50$ 41,512.5017,547.816/15/5850,312.5041,512.508,797.81GAITHER7/17/56$ 90,659.1512/15/56$ 35,937.5054,721.656/15/5735,937.5018,784.1512/15/5735,937.50$ 29,687.5012,534.156/15/5835,937.5029,687.506,284.15GREEN[Entries on the account of Green were identical as toamounts and dates with those shown on Gaither's account.]FRATES7/17/56$ 54,513.3212/15/56$ 21,562.5032,950.826/15/5721,562.5011,388.3212/15/5721,562.50$ 17,812.507,638.326/15/5821,562.5017,812.503,888.32BECKHAM[Entries on the account of Beckham were identical as toamounts and dates with those shown on the account of Frates.]*139  Under date of August 23, 1956, Livingstone &amp; Co. addressed a letter to Beckham, which provided as follows:Dear Sir:We wish to advise that the securities purchased for your account, $ 1,500,000 U.S. Treasury 2 3/8% Bonds of June 15, 1958, with 12/15/56 and 6/15/57 coupons detached, bear the following numbers:$ 100,000 denominations#29432#25825#25826#25481#25482#18785#19680#19681#14846#15606#23405#17452#49270#49271#49272Very truly yours,Livingstone &amp; Company(s) M.

Eli Livingstone and Gerald Bolotin were also involved in essentially the same manner as in the first and second transactions.  Prior to such \"third transaction,\" Livingstone addressed the following letter to Gaither:May 14, 1957(Dictated by phone)Mr. William C. GaitherPan American Bank BuildingMiami, FloridaDear Bill:It was nice talking to you  this morning.  In layman's language, what we propose is this: Based on $ 1,000,000.00 units, if you go to a broker and *145 offer him $ 1,000,000 of U.S. Treasury 2 3/4% Bonds due September 15, 1961 and he pays you 97 1/8, he will owe you $ 971,250.00.  This money is your money.The above would come about as follows:1. You borrow the bonds from me and deliver them to the broker.  Upon delivery, you are entitled to receive from him $ 971,250.00, or the proceeds of the sale you made to him.  This money belongs to you.  At this point, you have cash in your possession which is yours.2. The broker and you have squared your account because you have delivered to him the bonds you sold him, and he has paid you the money he owes you.3. Your obligation to me is that you owe me $ 1,000,000.00 in bonds; you do not owe me any money.You are obliged under the law to now compensate me for the coupons which would run in my favor, that is, $ 27,500.00 a year on the 2 3/4% Bonds of September 15, 1961.  This, however, constitutes a deduction from your taxable income based upon Section 212 of the Internal Revenue Code, and passed upon and adjudicated by the courts in the case of Norbert H. Wiesler v. Commissioner (6 T.C. 1148\">6 T.C. 1148) Affirmed 161 Federal 2nd Series 997), and F. A. Wilson v. Commissioner (Tax Court Memo Opinion, decision *146 entered into July 24, 1946, Affirmed 163 Federal 2nd Series 680, certiorari denied in each case 332 U.S. 842\">332 U.S. 842). Subsequent to this, the Commissioner acquiesced and issued 1 T 3989, 1950-1-13268.  For your convenience I am enclosing a copy.The commissioner ruled that the same principle applies to interest as to dividends.  This is so obvious that I regard it as completely superfluous, however, it does no harm.Now, you have in your possession, $ 971,250.00 in cash and with that cash you buy $ 1,000,000.00 U.S. Treasury 1 1/2% Notes due October 1, 1961.*863  This will leave you a credit balance of approximately $ 53,750.00 which you will deposit with us as collateral for the loan of the 2 3/4% bonds due September 15, 1961.You will pay us a premium in the amount of $ 12,500.00 per million.  This is also deductible.Having loaned you $ 1,000,000.00 in U.S. Treasury 2 3/4% Bonds, I request from you collateral to secure me.  You therefore deposit the 1 1/2% of October 1, 1961 which you purchased plus the credit balance of $ 53,750.00.  Adding the two  together, you have merely given me security now for the bonds which I have loaned to you, and which you have delivered to cover your short sale.Each *147 year, the income of $ 15,000.00 which you receive on the 1 1/2% Notes is taxable to you, and you have to report it.Each year you have to pay me $ 27,500.00 which represents the coupons on the loaned bonds.  Thus, there is a difference of $ 12,500.00 between the income you receive, and the expenses you incur.  This, of course, reduces your taxable income to that extent.At the end of the four years and four months that have to run, the $ 53,750.00 or approximately that amount has been exhausted by paying me the difference between the amount you receive as income, and the amount that you pay as expense.We now come to September 15, 1961.  You return to me $ 1,000,000.00 U.S. Treasury 2 3/4% Bonds or I buy them in for your account.  You have sustained a short term loss of $ 28,750.00.  The short term gain can be cancelled out with this loss.  If you have no short term gain, you can apply it against long term gain.At this point, the October 1, 1961's will be almost matured.  They will be worth approximately 100, maybe one or two thirty-seconds under or over.  You now liquidate these and realize $ 1,000,000.00.  The $ 1,000,000.00 that you realized from these will pay for the bonds that you *148 have borrowed from me, so that dollar wise it should be even, give or take a few pennies.  Inasmuch as you paid 91 3/4 for these, you will have a long term capital gain at that time of $ 82,500.00.If you have short term gains, it is advisable to cancel them out at that time against a short term loss.  You pick up the difference in any event as a long term capital gain.  The memorandum which we previously sent, and which we are now bringing up to date, will indicate how you will come out dollar wise on this transaction at that time.I have put this into very simple language.  I recognize that to those who don't deal with this all the time, it may be easier to follow in this manner.  In any event, all of the steps are included in the memorandums which are enclosed.I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.  In the meantime with my very best wishes, I remainAs ever,M.

You will deposit one point of margin.2. Interest will be at the rate of 4 5/8%.3. The coupons on the Treasury Notes will be applied toward the payment of interest and any balance due will be payable on liquidation.4. You would have the right to anticipate at any time payment of any or all of the interest to be due.5. You would not be subject to any calls for additional collateral during the term of this loan.This would enable you to arrange your deductions to suit your convenience.  If you have a big year in 1958, you could make a substantial payment of interest and thus minimize your tax.For those of you who have the higher incomes, we would suggest a purchase of $ 3,000,000 bonds.  This would give you a total interest deduction of $ 347,709.99 *153 which could be apportioned over the years 1958 through 1962 so as to obtain the optimum result.For those whose incomes are normally smaller, they would probably be able to use $ 1,500,000. or $ 2,000,000. bonds.The margin requirement would be $ 10,000. on each million bonds.

The amounts shown in the \"loan\" from Livingstone &amp; Co. of $ 20,000, as to petitioners Gaither, Green, Frates, and Beckham, and $ 36,000 as to Nichols, theoretically covered this margin. These amounts were not disbursed by Livingstone &amp; Co. to petitioners, but were credited, by book entry, to Livingstone Securities Corp., by Livingstone &amp; Co.On its books, on December 9, 1957, Corporate Finance Corp. made entries under headings of notes receivable and accounts receivable from each petitioner, as follows:Account receivableNote receivable(equal to accruedPetitionerbased on \"loan\"interest as of Dec. 9,at 92 1/41957, on the Apr. 1,1958, coupon)Nichols$ 3,321,000$ 10,236.27Gaither1,845,0005,686.81Green1,845,0005,686.81Frates1,845,0005,686.81Beckham1,845,0005,686.81 The note referred to above recited that the petitioners had deposited the 1 1/2 percent U.S. Treasury notes due April 1, 1962, with Corporate Finance Corp.

To the extent that any stipulated facts are not set forth above they are incorporated herein by this reference.  In addition to the stipulated facts the following facts are found on the evidence presented:Prior to entering into the first transaction petitioners were concerned about the actual acquisition and retention of the Government obligations involved.  They were aware of Rev. Rul. 54-94, 1 C.B. 53\">1954-1 C.B. 53, which indicated that the desired interest deduction would not be allowed where the obligations had been disposed of or \"sold short\" by the lending institution.  Although petitioners entered into the first transaction primarily, if not solely, for the purpose of reducing their Federal income taxes, they did so only after obtaining explicit assurances from M. Eli Livingstone that there would be no \"short sale,\" i.e., that there would be a genuine acquisition of bonds or notes that would be retained as collateral for their loans.  They would not have entered into this transaction otherwise.  Livingstone's assurances were false.  He had no intention of carrying out the transaction in accordance with *178 those assurances.Petitioners entered into the second and third transactions primarily, if not solely,  for the purpose of reducing their Federal income taxes.  However, when they did so, they similarly assumed that there would be genuine acquisitions of the Government obligations involved, relying upon Livingstone's assurances given at the inception of the first transaction.  The various communications, confirmation slips, and the like which Livingstone caused to be sent to petitioners in each of the three transactions falsely indicated that there had been genuine acquisitions of Government obligations.Petitioners were unaware until the spring of 1959 that Livingstone's representations were false.  Upon receiving deficiency notices for the year 1955 (subsequently litigated in Perry A. Nichols, supra), petitioner Beckham, in behalf of all petitioners, went to Boston in April 1959 to ascertain just what Livingstone had actually done.  Beckham *883  learned that Livingstone had not only violated his representations that there would be no \"short sale\" of the pledged collateral, but that all Treasury bonds and notes supposed to have been acquired in the various transactions had been \"purchased\" *179 and \"sold\" simultaneously.  Livingstone expressed the opinion that the Tax Court's decision in the \"test\" case then in litigation, Eli D. Goodstein, 30 T.C. 1178\">30 T.C. 1178, would be reversed on appeal, and he also made vague promises to take steps to rectify the situation.  Petitioners never obtained any restitution from Livingstone; they reasonably believed that he was judgment-proof and did not bring suit against him although they were advised by their Boston counsel that they had a valid cause of action against him for fraud.OPINIONThis case in its present posture represents the latest and, it may be hoped, the final episode in the serial involving M. Eli Livingstone and these petitioners.  The story began in 1955 when petitioners, tempted by the prospect of large reductions in their Federal income taxes, allowed themselves to be persuaded by Livingstone to enter into what has been described in our findings as the first transaction.  Thereafter, in 1956 and 1957, still lured by expectations of large tax benefits, they again yielded to Livingstone's sales pitch and entered into the second and third transactions.  That everything was not quite well in this tax paradise finally became apparent *180 when petitioners in 1959  received deficiency notices as to the year 1955.  The matter was litigated before us, and we held that the transaction was a sham with the consequence that the hoped-for tax benefits did not materialize.  Perry A. Nichols, 37 T.C. 772\">37 T.C. 772. Our decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 314 F.2d 337\">314 F. 2d 337.Meanwhile, deficiency notices were sent to petitioners for the years 1956, 1957, 1958, and 1959.  The three transactions covered more than the years in which they were initiated and thus the tax liabilities for all of the years 1956-59 were involved.  Petitioners sought review in this Court in the dockets now before us.  In their petitions they again claimed the tax benefits which Livingstone had promised them.  However, by the time this case was called for trial they took a more realistic view of the matter and have totally abandoned all claim to the enticing deductions that they had previously sought for each of the 4 years 1956-59.  By amendment to their pleadings they now claim an entirely different and far more modest deduction, and that one only for the year 1959.  The deduction which they now seek is simply for their out-of-pocket expenses *181 in respect of which they contend they were swindled by Livingstone.  In short, they urge that *884  they are entitled to a deduction on account of \"theft.\" 2 And, of course, if there was a \"theft\" within the meaning of the statute, the deduction is allowable in the year of discovery, 3 which in this case was 1959.  The entire trial before us was focused on this issue, and we are satisfied on this record that petitioners were in fact swindled and are therefore entitled to this consolation prize.Theft, as used in section 165 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, *182 is \"a word of general and broad connotation, intended to cover and covering any criminal appropriation of another's property to the use of the taker, particularly including theft by swindling, false pretenses, and any other form of guile.\" Edwards v. Bromberg, 232 F. 2d 107, 110 (C.A. 5).  Thus, the statute is satisfied where a contractor who was building a swimming pool for the taxpayer obtained payment from the latter on the strength of false representations that he in turn had paid the subcontractors and materialmen.  Evelyn Nell Norton, 40 T.C. 500, 504-505, affirmed 333 F. 2d 1005 (C.A. 9).We set forth in the margin petitioners' specifications of Livingstone's numerous fraudulent representations, as stated in their brief, 4 and we are convinced that they are amply supported by this record.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals in its review of our decision involving the first transaction and the year 1955 characterized one of the representations by Livingstone as being \"as false and fraudulent as the balance of the scheme.\"  314 F.2d 337\">314 F. 2d 337, 338. And the record before us establishes that Livingstone's fraud in obtaining money from petitioners brings this case within the applicable Florida*183 criminal statute in respect of obtaining money by \"false representations or pretense,\" Fla. Stat., sec. 811.021(1)(a), as well as within the provisions of the United States Code which make it a Federal crime to use the *885  mails to defraud, 518 U.S.C., sec. 1341. The crime under either Florida or Federal law was a \"theft\" within section 165 of the Internal Revenue Code.*886  In our opinion following the first trial we expressed skepticism that petitioners were innocent of Livingstone's actual doings.  37 T.C. at 789, 790. However, the record made in the trial of the present case removes all doubt and persuades us that petitioners were indeed deceived by Livingstone, and that they parted with their money only because they relied upon his false representations.The Government argues that petitioners sustained no loss arising out of theft, that they paid their money for a tax-avoidance scheme, that they never intended to get their money back, that they got what they bargained for, namely, a tax-avoidance scheme, and that their only loss was that the scheme didn't work.  The argument takes *188 too narrow a view of the matter.  Petitioners do not deny that they bargained for a tax-avoidance device, but it is their contention that the crucial element in the scheme that they bargained for was the bona fide acquisition and retention of the various Government bonds or notes, that they never would have parted with their money were it not for the false representations of Livingstone in this respect, and that they made the payments in issue only because they were deceived by Livingstone.  We think this contention more accurately reflects the situation before us.In allowing a deduction for \"theft\" losses Congress did not distinguish between losses sustained by the naive or greedy from those suffered by others.  Indeed gullibility or cupidity of the victim is often the crucial factor that enables the swindler to succeed in his fraud.  But no such criteria are relevant under the Internal Revenue Code in determining whether the victim of a swindle is entitled to the deduction.  Petitioners in this case entered the transaction before us with the expectation of realizing a tax bonanza, and they were cheated by Livingstone in the process.  It is a matter of no moment that even if actual *189 bonds had been purchased and retained it might still be held ultimately that they would not be entitled to the desired tax benefits because of lack of substance of the transaction as a whole (cf.  Knetsch v. United States, 364 U.S. 361\">364 U.S. 361; Bridges v. Commissioner, 325 F. 2d 180 (C.A. 4), affirming 39 T.C. 1064\">39 T.C. 1064). The point is that petitioners bargained for a transaction in which there would be real purchases of bonds or notes, so that they would be entitled to argue for their claimed tax benefit on the basis of a record involving real bonds or notes.  Thus, instead of getting what they now refer to as a \"quality facade,\" they obtained from Livingstone what they quite properly characterize as a thoroughly useless \"fake, counterfeit facade.\" And they paid their money for this \"fake, counterfeit facade\" only because they were taken in by Livingstone's false representations.  We hold that they were the victims of a swindle, and are entitled, as the statute is now written, to a deduction in respect of the moneys that they paid out in reliance upon Livingstone's false representations.*887  The Government also argues that Livingstone believed that his tax-savings schemes would ultimately be sustained *190 and that he therefore had no intent to commit a theft. The argument misses the point. Livingstone's fraud consisted in his false representations to petitioners as to the character of the transactions in which he persuaded them to participate.  They parted with money on the strength of those false representations and were thus swindled by him within the meaning of the criminal statutes.  Cf.  Finlay v. State, 152 Fla. 396\">152 Fla. 396, 12 So. 2d 112\">12 So. 2d 112.We are aware that this Court has disapproved claimed theft losses in a seemingly comparable situation.  James A. Dooley, T.C. Memo 1962-305\">T.C. Memo. 1962-305, 21 T.C.M. (CCH) 1633\">21 T.C.M. 1633, 1646; cf.  Louis H. Lewis, T.C. Memo 1962-306\">T.C. Memo. 1962-306, 21 T.C.M. (CCH) 1647\">21 T.C.M. 1647, 1659. In both of those cases the Court cited Miles v. Livingstone, 301 F. 2d 99 (C.A. 1), involving a suit against Livingstone by a disappointed customer who had entered into similar transactions with him.  But the Court of Appeals in Miles v. Livingstone made it clear that, in its opinion, Miles was not deceived and that it did \"not appear that the specific physical form in which the transactions were to be cast was of particular moment to him.\" 301 F. 2d at 101. And this Court's  decisions in Dooley and Lewis were based upon the *191 records before it, where it was similarly able to conclude, as had the Court of Appeals in Miles v. Livingstone, that those taxpayers had not been deceived by Livingstone.  The situation in the present case is in sharp contrast.  Here, we have credible evidence that the form of the transaction was of critical importance to petitioners, and that they entered into it only after having been deceived by Livingstone as to its nature.  Dooley and Lewis6*192  are thus distinguishable not only by reason of the foregoing considerations, but also because the losses were there claimed in the years in which they occurred rather than in the year in which the theft was discovered, as required by section 165(e), fn. 3, supra. A somewhat unusual situation exists in respect of petitioner Green.  By reason of the Commissioner's error in mailing the statutory notice of deficiency for 1955 and the consequent running of the statute of limitations, Green has succeeded in obtaining the benefit of the deductions promised by Livingstone for that year.  This fortuitous circumstance, however, does not detract from the fact that he was swindled by Livingstone in respect of the various payments made by him in 1955 as well as in later years.Decisions will be entered under Rule 50.

The balance to the account of Green at Livingstone &amp; Company in the additional amount of $ 6,284.15 was credited by book entry to his account at Court Finance and Loan Corp., at approximately June 16, 1958.\u21a95. The evidence discloses extensive use of the mails in carrying out Livingstone's scheme.\u21a94. First Transaction1. Livingstone represented that he would sell petitioners large quantities of U.S. Treasury notes.He had no Treasury notes and had no intention of selling any to petitioners.2. Livingstone represented that he had access to large banks and lending institutions and would arrange for petitioners to borrow the full purchase price of the Treasury notes.He had no such access to funds and never intended to loan any money or cause any money to be loaned to petitioners.3. When Hemmings pointed out that the Revenue Ruling disallowed interest deductions where the Treasury notes were sold short by the lending institution, Livingstone stated that no such sale would be made and that the Treasury notes would be held as collateral throughout the term of the loan.He never intended to live up to this representation, or to acquire any Treasury notes in the first place.4. Livingstone produced an opinion from a Chicago law firm which stated, in part, as follows: \"* * * the pledged collateral will definitely not be involved in any short sale transaction.\"* * * the funds will be loaned to the taxpayer-borrower directly by the lending institution or bank and will not involve the dealer in securities.\"Livingstone stated that the transaction would be carried out in the manner set forth in the opinion.He had no intention of living up to this representation and did not do so.5. Livingstone had Livingstone &amp; Co. mail to petitioners confirmation slips confirming the sale of the Treasury notes to petitioners.No such sale was made; Livingstone &amp; Co., in fact, had no Treasury notes to sell.6. Livingstone had Corporate Finance mail to petitioners a list of the serial numbers of the Treasury notes which it was holding as collateral.No such Treasury notes were, in fact, being held, nor were any Treasury notes being held, nor had they ever been acquired.7. The \"interest\" paid by petitioners to Corporate Finance was immediately paid over by Corporate Finance to Livingstone.Second Transaction1. Livingstone represented, orally and in letters, that he would loan Treasury notes to petitioners, for which loan they would pay a premium.He had no Treasury notes to loan, never intended to loan any, and never did loan any.2. Livingstone represented, orally and in letters, that he would arrange for petitioners to sell the borrowed Treasury notes and purchase Treasury bonds with the proceeds, which bonds would be held for petitioners by Livingstone.He had no intention of making any such sale or any such purchase, and never did so.3. Livingstone confirmed to petitioners by letter receipt of the Treasury bonds purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the borrowed Treasury notes.No such Treasury bonds were, in fact, received by him, nor had any ever been purchased.4. Livingstone had Livingstone &amp; Co. mail confirmation slips to petitioners, confirming the sale by Livingstone &amp; Co. to petitioners of the Treasury bonds.No such Treasury bonds were, in fact, sold to petitioners.5. Livingstone caused Salomon Bros. &amp; Hutzler to mail confirmation slips to petitioners confirming the purchase by Salomon Bros. from petitioners of the Treasury notes (supposed to have been borrowed from Livingstone).Livingstone concealed from petitioners his simultaneous purchase order from Salomon Bros. of Treasury notes in identical amounts, as a result of which no notes were, in fact, ever bought or sold by Salomon Bros.6. Livingstone had Livingstone &amp; Co. advise petitioners by letter dated August 23, 1956, of the serial numbers of the Treasury bonds which it had purchased for petitioners.No such Treasury bonds were, in fact, being held by Livingstone &amp; Co., nor were any Treasury bonds being held, nor had any ever been acquired.7. On January 15, 1958, Livingstone had Livingstone &amp; Co. again advise petitioners by letter that it was holding their Treasury bonds as collateral.No Treasury bonds were, in fact, being held as collateral, nor had any ever been acquired.Third Transaction1. Livingstone represented in letters and by telephone that he would sell petitioners large quantities of U.S. Treasury notes.He had no Treasury notes and had no intention of selling any to petitioners.2. Livingstone represented by letters and telephone that he would arrange for petitioners to borrow the full purchase price of the Treasury notes.He never intended to arrange and never did arrange for any money to be loaned to petitioners.3. Livingstone had Livingstone Securities Corp. mail to petitioners confirmation slips confirming the sale of the Treasury notes to petitioners.No such sale was made; Livingstone Securities Corp., in fact, had no Treasury notes to sell.4. The \"interest\" paid by petitioners to Corporate Finance Corp. was immediately turned over to or for the benefit of Livingstone by Corporate Finance Corp.\u21a92. I.R.C. 1954.SEC. 165.  LOSSES.(a) General Rule.  -- There shall be allowed as a deduction any loss sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.* * * *(c) Limitation on Losses of Individuals.  -- In the case of an individual, the deduction under subsection (a) shall be limited to --* * * * (3) losses of property not connected with a trade or business, if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft. * * *\u21a93. SEC. 165(e).Theft Losses.  -- For purposes of subsection (a), any loss arising from theft shall be treated as sustained during the taxable year in which the taxpayer discovers such loss.\u21a96. Although both Dooley and Lewis were appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, this issue was not passed upon by it.  In Dooley, the Court of Appeals stated that the taxpayer did not raise the theft loss issue, 332 F. 2d 463, 468, and in Lewis, it made no mention of the possible theft loss issue although it did consider and reject other contentions that the out-of-pocket expenses were deductible under other provisions of the Code as a loss on a transaction entered into for profit or as a capital loss.  328 F. 2d 634, 638-639.
