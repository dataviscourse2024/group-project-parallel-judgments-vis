VALDIVIA-FLORES                  3\n\napproach, the defendant\u2019s conviction therefore cannot\nsupport an aggravated felony determination. Because under\nWashington law a jury need not agree on whether a\ndefendant is a principal or accomplice, the panel held that\nthe Washington drug trafficking statute is not divisible so far\nas the distinction between those roles is concerned. The\npanel held that the modified categorical approach therefore\nmay not be applied, and it was error for the district court to\ndo so.\n\n    The panel concluded that the defendant was,\naccordingly, prejudiced from his inability to seek judicial\nreview for his 2009 removal, and that his collateral attack\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) on the underlying deportation\norder should have been successful.\n\n    Specially concurring, Judge O\u2019Scannlain wrote\nseparately to highlight how the result in this case illustrates\nthe bizarre and arbitrary effects of the ever-spreading\ncategorical approach for comparing state law offenses to\nfederal criminal definitions.\n\n    Dissenting, Judge Rawlinson wrote that the majority has\nimpermissibly veered away from the statute of conviction to\nfind overbreadth based on its analysis of a statute that was\nnot part of the prosecution or conviction in this case.\n\f4          UNITED STATES V.

In 1997, he\nwas charged with and ultimately pled guilty to a violation of\nWashington\u2019s drug trafficking statute, Wash. Rev. Code\n\u00a7 69.50.401. In his Statement of Defendant on Plea of\nGuilty, Valdivia-Flores described the crime he was being\ncharged with as: \u201cpossession with intent to deliver\u2014\nHeroin.\u201d He also wrote out the elements of the crime:\n\u201cPossess a controlled substance (heroin) with intent to\ndistribute it in King County and know it was a narcotic\ndrug.\u201d Finally, stating what made him guilty of Wash. Rev.\nCode \u00a7 69.50.401 in his own words, Valdivia-Flores wrote:\n\u201cOn June 20, 1997 in King County WA I did unlawfully\n\f           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                5\n\npossess with intent to deliver Heroin a controlled substance\nand did know it was a controlled substance.\u201d Valdivia-\nFlores was sentenced to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, which he\nserved at an accelerated pace over seven months at a work\nethic camp.\n\n    While he was in the camp, immigration officers prepared\na Notice to Appear which charged Valdivia-Flores with\nbeing removable. In an order dated January 28, 1998, an\nimmigration judge suspended the immigration proceedings\nbecause Valdivia-Flores was still serving his sentence at the\ncamp and therefore could not be produced for a hearing.\nNonetheless, at the conclusion of his sentence in April 1998,\nimmigration officers physically removed Valdivia-Flores to\nMexico without an order. Valdivia-Flores returned to the\nState of Washington that same year, again without\ninspection at the border.\n\n    In 2009, Valdivia-Flores was convicted of malicious\nmischief in the third degree in violation of Wash. Rev. Code\n\u00a7 9A.48.090 for smashing the windshield of his wife\u2019s\nvehicle after an argument. He pled guilty, and his sentence\nwas suspended. At the time of that prosecution, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security initiated administrative\nremoval proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). In\nMarch 2009, he received two copies of a form, one in\nEnglish and one in Spanish, titled Notice of Rights and\nRequest for Disposition. This notice informed Valdivia-\nFlores that he had \u201cthe right to a hearing before the\nImmigration Court to determine whether [he] may remain in\nthe United States.\u201d Valdivia-Flores filled out and signed the\nSpanish version of the form, electing to request a hearing\nbefore the Immigration Court.\n\n   Also in March 2009, the Department of Homeland\nSecurity issued Valdivia-Flores a Notice of Intent to Issue a\n\f6           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\nFinal Administrative Removal Order (\u201cNotice of Intent\u201d). It\nstated that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s 1997 conviction under Wash.\nRev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a) was for an aggravated felony so\nthat he was removable without a hearing before an\nimmigration judge. The Notice of Intent informed Valdivia-\nFlores of his right to petition for review of his removal in the\nappropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It also provided\nthree check-boxes of options by which Valdivia-Flores\ncould \u201ccontest [his] deportability\u201d: (1) he could assert that\nhe was \u201ca citizen or national of the United States\u201d; (2) he\ncould assert that he was \u201ca lawful permanent resident\u201d; and\n(3) he could claim that he was \u201cnot convicted of the criminal\noffense described\u201d in the Notice of Intent. Valdivia-Flores\ndid not contest his removal or request withholding of\nremoval and instead checked a box acknowledging that he\nhad \u201cthe right to remain in the United States for 14 calendar\ndays in order to apply for judicial review\u201d and that he\n\u201cwaive[d] this right.\u201d He did not petition for review of the\nremoval decision and was removed on April 4, 2009. He\nremained in Mexico for a few days and then unlawfully\nreentered the United States for a third time.\n\n     On August 13, 2013, Valdivia-Flores was arrested in\nWashington for being an illegal alien found in the United\nStates, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He pled guilty and\nwas convicted in the Western District of Washington in\nSeptember 2013. Immigration authorities once again\ninitiated removal proceedings. Valdivia-Flores requested\nasylum and sought a stay of removal \u201cfor humanitarian\nreasons,\u201d but those requests were denied, and Valdivia-\nFlores was removed in September 2014.\n\n    On November 13, 2014, Valdivia-Flores attempted to\nreturn (for a fourth time) to the United States, applying for\nentry through the pedestrian lanes at the San Ysidiro,\n\f             UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                          7\n\nCalifornia port of entry. Valdivia-Flores falsely identified\nhimself as another person and presented a false and\nfraudulent United States Certification of Naturalization. He\nwas charged with one count of attempted reentry of a\nremoved alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and one count\nof fraudulent use of an immigration document in violation of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546.\n\n    Prior to trial, Valdivia-Flores brought a collateral attack\nagainst the validity of his 2009 order of removal and moved\nto dismiss the attempted reentry count of the indictment.\nThe district court denied the motion to dismiss because\nValdivia-Flores \u201cdid in fact admit in his plea agreement to\ncommitting a drug trafficking offense, which is an\naggravated felony.\u201d\n\n    The parties then entered into a stipulation in which\nValdivia-Flores agreed to facts satisfying all the elements of\nboth counts in the indictment. Based on those stipulated\nfacts, following a bench trial the district court found\nValdivia-Flores guilty of both charges and sentenced him to\n21 months\u2019 imprisonment on both counts, running\nconcurrently.\n\n   Valdivia-Flores filed this timely appeal and seeks to\nchallenge collaterally the classification of his underlying\nWashington state conviction as an aggravated felony. 1\n\n\n\n    1\n      \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an\nindictment brought pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) de novo.\u201d United\nStates v. Cisneros-Rodriguez, 813 F.3d 748, 755 (9th Cir. 2015) (citation\nomitted). Whether a crime constituted an aggravated felony is a question\nof law reviewed de novo. See Wang v. Rodriguez, 830 F.3d 958, 960\n(9th Cir. 2016).\n\f8          UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\n                             II\n\n    Valdivia-Flores contends that because his 1997\nconviction was incorrectly determined to be an aggravated\nfelony, his 2009 removal was invalid. If the 2009 removal\nwas invalid, that \u201cprecludes reliance on th[at] deportation\u201d\nin the subsequent illegal reentry prosecution. United States\nv. Ramos, 623 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2010). Valdivia-\nFlores\u2019s collateral attack is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d),\nwhich allows such an attack to succeed if Valdivia-Flores\ncan demonstrate that (1) he exhausted the administrative\nremedies available for seeking relief from the predicate\nremoval order; (2) the removal proceedings improperly\ndeprived him of the opportunity for judicial review; and\n(3) the removal order was fundamentally unfair. 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d). The first two prongs of \u00a7 1326(d) are satisfied if\nhis right to appeal was denied in violation of due process.\nUnited States v. Gomez, 757 F.3d 885, 893 (9th Cir. 2014).\n\n    Valdivia-Flores contends that his due process rights were\nindeed violated because \u201cimmigration officials failed to\nobtain a knowing waiver of\u201d his right to appeal the removal\norder. Gomez, 757 F.3d at 893. \u201cIn order for [a] waiver to\nbe valid . . . it must be both considered and intelligent.\u201d\nUnited States v. Arrieta, 224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The government\ncontends that Valdivia-Flores did validly waive his right to\nappeal by signing the Notice of Intent, by failing to appeal,\nand by freely choosing instead to return to this country\nunlawfully.\n\n    Because Valdivia-Flores asserts that his waiver was not\nconsidered and intelligent, the government must show by\nclear and convincing evidence that the waiver was valid,\nRamos, 623 F.3d at 681, and it may not simply rely on the\nsigned document purportedly agreeing to the waiver, Gomez,\n\f           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                 9\n\n757 F.3d at 895. Because we cannot rely on the contested\nwaiver document itself, we evaluate the surrounding\ncircumstances to determine whether the government can\novercome the presumption against waiver. See Cisneros-\nRodriguez, 813 F.3d at 756.\n\n    Here, although the Notice of Intent described the\nwindow in which Valdivia-Flores could respond to the\ncharges against him or file a petition for judicial review, it\ndid not explicitly inform him that he could refute, through\neither an administrative or judicial procedure, the legal\nconclusion underlying his removability. In fact, the Notice\nof Intent\u2019s three check boxes suggested just the opposite\u2014\nthat removability could only be contested on factual\ngrounds. The list of options available to \u201ccheck off\u201d did not\ninclude an option to contest the classification of the\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and the only check box\nrelevant to the conviction itself only allowed Valdivia-Flores\nto contest that he \u201cwas not convicted of the criminal offense\ndescribed.\u201d\n\n    The form\u2019s deficiencies are magnified because Valdivia-\nFlores \u201cwas not represented and never had the benefit of\nappearing before an [immigration judge], who, we presume,\nwould have adequately conveyed both [his] appeal options\nand the finality associated with waiving appeal.\u201d Ramos,\n623 F.3d at 681 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed,\nthe Notice of Intent was issued without a hearing before an\nimmigration judge despite Valdivia-Flores\u2019s request for a\nhearing. The government provides no evidence that an\nimmigration officer ever met with Valdivia-Flores to explain\nthe form or the issues it raised; rather, the government\nmerely relies on the sufficiency of the form\u2019s text to\ncommunicate Valdivia-Flores\u2019s options.\n\f10         UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\n    Under these circumstances, we conclude that Valdivia-\nFlores\u2019s waiver of the right to seek judicial review was not\nconsidered and intelligent. Accord Gomez, 757 F.3d at 896\n(explaining that the fact that an alien signed a waiver was\ninsufficient to meet the government\u2019s burden to establish a\nvalid waiver when the record reflected deficiencies in the\nadvisements given). Therefore, he was deprived of due\nprocess and satisfies the first two prongs of 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d).\n\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n    With a due process violation established, the next step in\nValdivia-Flores\u2019s argument is that the 2009 removal order\n\u201cwas fundamentally unfair,\u201d so he satisfies the final prong of\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) to succeed in his collateral attack. He\nmust \u201cshow that it was \u2018plausible\u2019 that he would have\nreceived some form of relief from removal had his rights not\nbeen violated in the removal proceedings.\u201d Gomez, 757 F.3d\nat 898 (quoting Arrieta, 224 F.3d at 1079). To meet that\nburden, Valdivia-Flores argues that, had he sought judicial\nreview of the order, he would have prevailed in showing that\nhe was not convicted of an aggravated felony as alleged in\nthe Notice of Intent as the sole basis for his removal without\na hearing before an immigration judge. The government\ndisagrees and argues that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s drug trafficking\nconviction was properly classified as an aggravated felony.\nWe must therefore determine whether Valdivia-Flores\u2019s\n1997 conviction under Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401 was for\nan aggravated felony.\n\n    To determine whether an offense qualifies as an\n\u201caggravated felony,\u201d we apply the categorical approach\narticulated in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990).\n\f           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                 11\n\nRendon v. Holder, 764 F.3d 1077, 1082 (9th Cir. 2014).\nUnder the categorical approach, \u201cwe look not to the facts of\nthe particular prior case, but instead to whether the state\nstatute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits\nwithin the generic federal definition of a corresponding\naggravated felony.\u201d Roman-Suaste v. Holder, 766 F.3d\n1035, 1038 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n    To make his argument that the Washington drug-\ntrafficking law is broader than its federal analogue, Valdivia-\nFlores observes that, under both the federal and state\ncriminal laws, a person charged with a drug trafficking\noffense may be convicted either as a principal or for aiding\nand abetting. Critically, he says, Washington defines aiding\nand abetting more broadly than does federal law so that\nWashington forbids more conduct.\n\n    The implicit nature of aiding and abetting liability in\nevery criminal charge is sufficiently well-settled that the\ngovernment in this case does not contest it. See Gonzales v.\nDuenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 189 (2007) (In the United\nStates, \u201cevery jurisdiction\u2014all States and the Federal\nGovernment\u2014has expressly abrogated the distinction\namong principals and aiders and abettors.\u201d). Instead, the\ngovernment contends that Washington\u2019s definition of aiding\nand abetting liability is essentially the same as the federal\ndefinition so that they do, in fact, match categorically.\n\n    At the time of Valdivia-Flores\u2019s conviction,\nWashington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute stated: \u201cA person\nis an accomplice . . . in the commission of a crime if . . .\n[w]ith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the\ncommission of the crime, he . . . solicits, commands,\nencourages, or requests such other person to commit it; or\naids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or\n\f12          UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\ncommitting it.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.020(3)(a)(i)\u2013(ii)\n(1997) (emphasis added). In contrast, under federal law, \u201cto\nprove liability as an aider and abettor the government must\nestablish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the\nspecific intent to facilitate the commission of a crime by\nsomeone else.\u201d United States v. Garcia, 400 F.3d 816, 819\n(9th Cir. 2005) (emphasis added). Therefore, federal law\nrequires a mens rea of specific intent for conviction for\naiding and abetting, whereas Washington requires merely\nknowledge.\n\n    Consistent with the Model Penal Code on which it is\nbased, Washington\u2019s criminal law expressly codifies the\ndistinction between intent and knowledge and makes plain\nthat knowledge is a less demanding mens rea requirement.\n\u201cA person acts with intent or intentionally when he acts with\nthe objective or purpose to accomplish a result which\nconstitutes a crime.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.010(1)(a)\n(1997) (emphasis added). In contrast, \u201c[a] person knows or\nacts knowingly or with knowledge when . . . (i) he is aware\nof a fact, facts, or circumstances or result described by a\nstatute defining an offense; or (ii) he has information which\nwould lead a reasonable man in the same situation to believe\nthat facts exist which facts are described by a statute defining\nan offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9A.08.010(1)(b) (emphasis added).\n\n    The same distinction exists in federal law. There, \u201ca\nperson who causes a particular result is said to act\npurposefully\u201d\u2014or with specific intent\u2014\u201cif he consciously\ndesires that result . . . while he is said to act knowingly if he\nis aware that that result is practically certain to follow from\nhis conduct, whatever his desire may be as to that result.\u201d\nUnited States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 404 (1980) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Abagninin v. AMVAC\nChem. Corp., 545 F.3d 733, 739 (9th Cir. 2008)\n\f             UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                         13\n\n(distinguishing specific intent from \u201cmere knowledge, or\ngeneral intent\u201d).\n\n     Therefore, the Washington drug trafficking law on its\nface appears to have a more inclusive mens rea requirement\nfor accomplice liability than its federal analogue. The\nWashington Supreme Court\u2019s case law indicates that the\ndistinction between intent and knowledge is meaningful. 2\nSee State v. Thomas, 208 P.3d 1107, 1111 (Wash. 2009)\n(\u201cTo convict an accomplice of premeditated murder in the\nfirst degree, the State need not show that the accomplice had\nthe intent that the victim would be killed. The prosecution\nneed only prove that the defendant knew his actions would\nfacilitate the crime . . . .\u201d); State v. Roberts, 14 P.3d 713,\n731\u201332 (Wash. 2000) (\u201cThe accomplice liability statute\nrequires only a mens rea of knowledge . . . . [A]n\naccomplice, like a felony murder defendant, may be\nconvicted with a lesser mens rea and a lesser actus reus than\na principal to premeditated first degree murder.\u201d); State v.\nGocken, 896 P.2d 1267, 1273\u201374 (Wash. 1995) (\u201cCriminal\nconspiracy requires an element of intent, while accomplice\nliability requires a lesser culpable state of knowledge.\u201d).\n\n                                   B\n\n    The government\u2019s principal response to this statutory\nlanguage and case law is to cite contrary Washington case\nlaw that suggests accomplice liability turns on a mens rea\nstandard closer to intent than knowledge. E.g., In re Welfare\nof Wilson, 588 P.2d 1161, 1164 (Wash. 1979) (\u201c[I]t is the\nencouragement plus the intent of the bystander to encourage\n\n    2\n      State statutes and the state court decisions interpreting them are\nboth \u201cauthoritative sources of state law.\u201d Mathis v.

The Washington Supreme Court cases the\ngovernment cites, however, significantly predate the above-\nquoted authoritative interpretations by that court, and in\nsome cases they even predate the 1976 enactment of\nWashington\u2019s modern accomplice liability statute. The\nmore recent state intermediate appellate court cases are also\nless authoritative than the clear statements of Washington\u2019s\nhighest court. We are satisfied that the government\u2019s cited\ncase law is less authoritative than the more recent\nWashington Supreme Court cases that indicate a clear\ndistinction between the mental states of intent and\nknowledge.\n\n    In the face of the clear statutory language and the most\nauthoritative state case law, the government argues as a\nfallback that\u2014even if there is a formal distinction between\nthe state and federal mens rea requirements\u2014in practice,\nWashington\u2019s law does not \u201cextend significantly beyond\u201d its\nfederal analogue for purposes of categorical comparison.\nDuenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 193.                  Whatever the\nmetaphysical merit of the government\u2019s attack on the\ndistinction between intent and knowledge, we have held that,\n\u201cwhere, as here, a state statute explicitly defines a crime\nmore broadly than the generic definition, no \u2018legal\nimagination\u2019 is required to hold that a realistic probability\nexists that the state will apply its statute to conduct that falls\noutside the generic definition of the crime.\u201d United States v.\nGrisel, 488 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting Duenas-\nAlvarez, 549 U.S. at 193). Because the difference in breadth\n\f              UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                          15\n\nis apparent on the face of the statute, we must conclude that\nWashington\u2019s statute is broader than its federal analogue.\n\n    Finally, the government makes a pragmatic argument\nthat, under Valdivia-Flores\u2019s proposed application of the\ncategorical approach, \u201cno Washington state conviction can\nserve as an aggravated felony at all because of [the]\naccomplice liability statute\u201d and that such a result \u201ccannot\nhave been Congress\u2019s intent.\u201d The government here merely\njoins a chorus of those who \u201chave raised concerns about [the]\nline of decisions\u201d applying the categorical approach, \u201c[b]ut\nwhether for good or for ill, the elements-based approach\nremains the law.\u201d Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243,\n2257 (2016). Indeed, Justice Kennedy wrote separately in\nMathis to note specifically that Congress \u201ccould not have\nintended vast . . . disparities for defendants convicted of\nidentical criminal conduct in different jurisdictions\u201d; but he\nconcurred in the opinion that held that the categorical\napproach required just that result. Id. at 2258 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring). As an inferior court, we must follow suit.\n\n    Under a straightforward application of the categorical\napproach, Washington\u2019s drug trafficking statute is overbroad\ncompared to its federal analogue, and Valdivia-Flores\u2019s\nconviction cannot support an aggravated felony\ndetermination. 3\n\n\n    3\n       Our dissenting colleague rejects potential differences between\nWashington and federal aiding and abetting liability on the ground that\nwe should look no further than the state statute defining the principal\noffense of drug trafficking, which does match its federal analogue. But\nas the dissent points out, \u201cconviction of aiding and abetting is tantamount\nto conviction of the underlying offense.\u201d It is for just that reason that,\nunder the categorical approach, \u201cthe criminal activities of . . . aiders and\nabettors of a generic\u201d offense \u201cmust themselves fall within the scope of\n\f16            UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\n                                     C\n\n    The district court\u2019s ruling, however, was based on a\nsomewhat alternative analysis: applying the modified\ncategorical approach, which permits a court to look at the\ndocuments of conviction. Using those, the district court\ndetermined that Valdivia-Flores was, in fact, convicted as a\nprincipal rather than an accomplice and so fell within the\nfederal generic drug trafficking prohibition.\n\n    It is only \u201c[i]n a narrow range of cases,\u201d however, \u201cwhen\nthe statute at issue is divisible,\u201d that a court \u201cmay employ\u201d\nthe modified categorical approach to look at the underlying\ndocuments of conviction. 4 Ramirez v. Lynch, 810 F.3d 1127,\n1131 (9th Cir. 2016). Where a \u201cstatutory phrase . . . refers\n\nthe [analogue] federal statute.\u201d Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 190. The\ntest under Taylor is straightforward in this context: \u201c[i]f the state statute\ncriminalizes conduct that would not constitute a drug trafficking offense\nunder federal . . . law, then a prior conviction under that statute does not\ncategorically qualify\u201d as an aggravated felony. United States v.\nValdavinos-Torres, 704 F.3d 679, 691 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Because the Washington statute does criminalize\nconduct that would not constitute a drug offense under federal law\u2014due\nto the distinct aiding and abetting definitions\u2014it is overbroad. That we\nhave rejected an overbreadth challenge to this Washington statute before\nis irrelevant because such challenge was based on an argument unrelated\nto the overbreadth of the aiding and abetting component of the statute.\nSee United States v. Burgos-Ortega, 777 F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th Cir. 2015)\n(considering an overbreadth challenge because the Washington statute\ndid not include same exemption for \u201cadministering\u201d a drug as its federal\nanalogue).\n     4\n       The dissent argues \u201cthat documents in the record relevant to\nValdivia-Flores\u2019 conviction leave little doubt that he was convicted as a\nprincipal and not as an accomplice.\u201d We may not consider such\ndocuments, of course, if the statute is not divisible.\n\f             UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                       17\n\nto multiple, alternative means of commission\u201d of the crime,\nit must \u201cbe regarded as indivisible if the jurors need not agree\non which method of committing the offense the defendant\nused.\u201d Rendon, 764 F.3d at 1085.\n\n    Washington law is clear that jurors need not agree on\nwhether a defendant is a principal or accomplice. See State\nv. Hoffman, 804 P.2d 577, 605 (Wash. 1991) (\u201c[I]t is not\nnecessary that jurors be unanimous as to the manner of an\naccomplice\u2019s and a principal\u2019s participation as long as all\nagree that they did participate in the crime.\u201d). Because a jury\nneed not distinguish between principals and accomplices, the\ndrug trafficking statute is not divisible so far as the\ndistinction between those roles is concerned, so the modified\ncategorical approach may not be applied, and it was error for\nthe district court to do so. 5\n\n                                 IV\n\n    Because Valdivia-Flores\u2019s drug trafficking conviction\ndoes not qualify as an aggravated felony under the\ncategorical approach, it cannot support the asserted basis for\nValdivia-Flores\u2019s 2009 removal. Valdivia-Flores was\ntherefore prejudiced from his inability to seek judicial\nreview for that removal. He thus satisfies all three elements\nof 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d), and his collateral attack on the\nunderlying deportation order should have been successful.\n\n   The judgment of the district court is therefore\nREVERSED and the case REMANDED for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n    5\n      That conclusion comports with our prior holding regarding federal\naiding and abetting liability outside of the immigration context, where\nwe have held that \u201c[a]iding and abetting . . . is simply one means of\ncommitting a . . . crime.\u201d Garcia, 400 F.3d at 820.\n\f18          UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\nO\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge, specially concurring.\n\n    Although the result in this case is dictated by the case\nlaw of the Supreme Court and our Circuit, I write separately\nto highlight how it illustrates the bizarre and arbitrary effects\nof the ever-spreading categorical approach for comparing\nstate law offenses to federal criminal definitions. I am\nhardly the first federal circuit judge to express puzzlement at\nhow the categorical approach has come to be applied. See,\ne.g., United States v. Doctor, 842 F.3d 306, 312 (4th Cir.\n2016) (Wilkinson, J., concurring); United States v. Faust,\n853 F.3d 39, 60 (1st Cir. 2017) (Lynch, J., concurring);\nUnited States v. Chapman, 866 F.3d 129, 136 (3d Cir. 2017)\n(Jordan, J., concurring). That criticism arises largely in\nrelation to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d),\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)\u2014in which context the categorical\napproach was created to apply sentencing enhancements\nbased on prior state convictions\u2014but the case before us\nillustrates the much broader reach of its peculiar\nconsequences.\n\n    Almost three decades ago, in Taylor v. United States,\n495 U.S. 575 (1990), the Supreme Court developed the\ncategorical approach in the context of ACCA, which\nimposes heightened mandatory minimums for serious repeat\noffenders. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Two decades later, it had\nbecome clear that the same approach applied to determine\nwhat state crimes fell within certain categories enumerated\nin the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et\nseq. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 187\n(2007). Several justices of the Supreme Court have\nexpressed concern about the \u201carbitrary and inequitable\nresults produced by applying\u201d the categorical approach to\nthe ACCA sentencing scheme. Mathis v. United States,\n136 S. Ct. 2243, 2258 (2016) (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n\f           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                 19\n\n(noting similar criticisms raised in dissent by Justices\nGinsburg, Breyer, and Alito). The results can be even more\narbitrary in other contexts, including the case before us\ninvolving a collateral attack on a removal order.\n\n    As Judge Wilkinson observed in his criticism of the\npresent state of the categorical approach, when it comes to\nACCA and sentencing, a district court \u201chas various tools to\nimpose a stricter sentence if it believes that the categorical\napproach is ignoring a violent criminal history or disserving\nthe general aims of sentencing.\u201d Doctor, 842 F.3d at 317\n(Wilkinson, J., concurring). Under the advisory sentencing\nguidelines, a district court can depart outside the guidelines\nto correct for a particularly unjust or absurd application of\nthe categorical approach.\n\n     In the context of the case before us, however, there is no\nway to remedy an especially absurd result of applying the\ncategorical approach. When a removal premised on a prior\nstate conviction for an aggravated felony is collaterally\nattacked years later, a court\u2019s only role once reaching the\nmerits is to apply the categorical approach and to determine\nif the state statute of conviction was a categorical match with\nits federal analogue. As today\u2019s decision makes clear, if the\nchallenger is clever enough to find some space in the state\nstatutory scheme that lies outside the federal analogue, he\ncan effectively void that prior removal for purposes of his\npresent illegal reentry prosecution\u2014even though the\nchallenger admits that the actual conduct underlying his state\nconviction falls at the heart of the federal analogue. There is\nno discretion to be exercised.\n\n    Congress made clear its desire to remove aliens who\nhave committed \u201caggravated felonies,\u201d which it expressly\ndefined to include any \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), meaning \u201cany felony punishable under the\n\f20          UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\nControlled Substances Act,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. Nobody\ncontests that Valdivia-Flores possessed heroin with intent to\ndeliver it, nor that such conduct is indeed a felony punishable\nunder the Controlled Substances Act. There is no reason to\ndoubt, then, that Valdivia-Flores actually did commit an\naggravated felony. Because of the judicially-created\ncategorical approach and a quirk in the drafting of\nWashington\u2019s statutory scheme, however, he escapes the\nconsequences that Congress intended for such conduct.\n\n    Whatever the merits of the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for\nimposing the categorical approach on sentencing under\nACCA, where judges have discretion to correct for\nparticularly arbitrary and unjust results, the effect is far more\npernicious in cases such as this one where there is no chance\nfor correction. Shouldn\u2019t it be possible to have a more\n\u201cpractical reading\u201d of the Immigration and Nationality Act\nso that, \u201c[w]hen it is clear that a defendant necessarily\nadmitted or the jury necessarily found that the defendant\ncommitted the elements of [the generic federal crime], the\nconviction should qualify\u201d for purposes of classifying it as\nan aggravated felony? Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct.\n2276, 2295 (2013) (Alito, J., dissenting). If the Supreme\nCourt is unwilling to revisit the categorical approach for\ncases such as this one, Congress should consider clarifying\nwhether it truly intended radically different treatment for\naliens \u201cconvicted of identical criminal conduct in different\njurisdictions.\u201d Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2258 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring).\n\f           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                21\n\nRAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n    Jose Valdivia-Flores was convicted of possession with\nintent to deliver a controlled substance in violation of Wash.\nRev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401. The majority describes our task as\n\u201cdetermin[ing] whether Valdivia-Flores\u2019 conviction under\nWash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401 was for an aggravated\nfelony.\u201d Majority Opinion, p. 10. Yet, inexplicably, the\nmajority completely fails to address that statute.\n\n    In determining whether Valdivia-Flores was convicted\nof an aggraved felony, we compare the state statute of\nconviction to the generic federal definition of possession\nwith intent to deliver a controlled substance. See Roman-\nSuaste v. Holder, 766 F.3d 1035, 1038 (9th Cir. 2014). The\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines the term\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201cillicit trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21),\nincluding a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section\n924(c) of Title 18).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); see also\nRoman-Suaste, 766 F.3d at 1038. The phrase \u201cdrug\ntrafficking crime\u201d supplies the generic federal description of\npossession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver,\ndefined in pertinent part as \u201cany felony punishable under the\nControlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).\u201d\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2); see also Roman-Suaste, 766 F.3d at\n1038. A \u201cfelony\u201d includes an offense for which the\nmaximum term of imprisonment is \u201cmore than one year.\u201d\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(5); see also Roman-Suaste, 766 F.3d at\n1038. Ultimately, \u201cunder the plain language of these\nprovisions, a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony\nwhen it is for an offense that the Controlled Substances Act\n(CSA) makes punishable by more than one year\u2019s\nimprisonment.\u201d United States v. Gonzalez-Corn, 807 F.3d\n\f22         UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\n989, 993 (9th Cir. 2015) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n    The pertinent CSA provision in this case, provides:\n\u201cExcept as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful\nfor any person knowingly or intentionally . . . to\nmanufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent\nto manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled\nsubstance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The Washington statute\nunderlying Valdivia-Flores\u2019 1997 conviction, stated in\npertinent part: \u201cExcept as authorized by this chapter, it is\nunlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess\nwith intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled\nsubstance.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a) (1997).\n\n     Washington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute stated at the\ntime of Valdivia-Flores\u2019 conviction: \u201cA person is an\naccomplice of another person in the commission of a crime\nif . . .[w]ith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the\ncommission of the crime, he . . .[s]olicits, commands,\nencourages, or requests such other person to commit it; or\n[a]ids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or\ncommitting it.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.020(3)(a)(i)-(ii)\n(1997).\n\n    Valdivia-Flores does not vigorously challenge the notion\nthat a drug trafficking offense constitutes an aggravated\nfelony. Rather, he contends that our categorical analysis\nshould focus on Washington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute,\nwhich he argues is implicit in Washington\u2019s drug trafficking\nstatute. Valdivia-Flores relies heavily on the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Gonzalez v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S.\n183 (2007). He further contends that the implicit aiding and\nabetting liability is overbroad and indivisible.\n\f           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                23\n\n    The majority goes astray by accepting Valdivia-Flores\u2019\nargument. Reliance on Duenas-Alvarez as authority to\nsupport focusing our categorical analysis on Washington\u2019s\naiding and abetting statute is misplaced. In Duenas-Alvarez,\nthe Supreme Court held that a \u201ctheft offense\u201d includes the\ncrime of aiding and abetting a theft offense. 549 U.S. at 189\u2013\n90. However, the statute at issue provided in pertinent part:\n\n       Any person who drives or takes a vehicle not\n       his or her own, without the consent of the\n       owner thereof, and with intent either to\n       permanently or temporarily deprive the\n       owner thereof of his or her title to or\n       possession of the vehicle, whether with or\n       without intent to steal the vehicle, or any\n       person who is a party or an accessory to or\n       an accomplice in the driving or unauthorized\n       taking or stealing, is guilty of a public\n       offense.\n\nId. at 187 (quoting Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a7 10851(a)) (some\nemphasis added). Importantly, the language supporting an\nanalysis of aiding and abetting liability came directly from\nthe statute underlying Duenas-Alvarez\u2019s conviction. See id.\nThus, the Supreme Court compared Cal. Veh. Code Ann.\n\u00a7 10851(a), the statute of conviction, to the generic\ndefinition of a theft offense, consistent with a traditional\ncategorical analysis. See id. at 189\u201394.\n\n   The majority compares Washington\u2019s aiding and\nabetting statute\u2014a statute that Valdivia admitted is a\nseparate statute from the statute of conviction\u2014to the\ngeneric definition of aiding and abetting. See Majority\nOpinion, pp. 11\u201313. As the district court observed in United\n\f24         UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Altamirano, No. 14CR 750-BEN, 2014\nWL 7047636 at *5 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2014):\n\n       Defendant . . . asks the Court to go beyond\n       the Washington statute of conviction, look at\n       a different statute, find that it impliedly\n       applies to every offense, and find the\n       application of the implication carries the\n       conviction beyond the federal generic drug\n       trafficking offense. To borrow a phrase, this\n       argument requires the sort of theoretical\n       possibility that was cautioned against in\n       Gonzalez v. Duenas-Alvarez. . . .\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Tellingly, as\nin Gonzalez-Altamirano, the majority cites no precedent\nskipping over the actual statute of conviction to plug a\ncompletely different statute into the Taylor analysis. See\n2014 WL 7047636 at *4. Further detracting from the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion, we have explicitly determined that a\nconviction under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 69.50.401 qualifies as a\nconviction for an aggravated felony in a different context.\nSee United States v. Burgos-Ortega, 777 F.3d 1047, 1054\u2013\n55 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 2848 (2015) (upholding\na sentence enhancement). Unlike the majority, we rejected\nthe argument that the statute was categorically overbroad.\nSee id.\n\n    It is also worth mentioning that documents in the record\nrelevant to Valdivia-Flores\u2019 conviction leave little doubt that\nhe was convicted as a principal and not as an accomplice.\nThe information charged Valdivia-Flores with unlawfully\nand feloniously possessing with the intent to manufacture or\ndeliver heroin in violation of Wash. Rev.Code\n\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1). The Plea Statement signed by Valdivia-\n\f           UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES                 25\n\nFlores contains a handwritten acknowledgment that he was\ncharged with possession of heroin with intent to deliver,\nstating the elements of the crime, and describing in his own\nwords that he did \u201cunlawfully possess with intent to deliver\nHeroin\u201d knowing that it was a controlled substance. In a\nstipulation of facts provided to the district court, Valdivia-\nFlores agreed that on August 8, 1997, he suffered a felony\nconviction for Possession with Intent to Deliver Heroin, in\nviolation of Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a). Finally, the\nstate court\u2019s judgment and sentence documented that\nValdivia-Flores was convicted of Possession with Intent to\nDeliver Heroin in violation of Wash. Rev. Code\n\u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1). Noticeably, no evidence in the record\nrefers to Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.020 or suggests that\nValdivia-Flores was convicted as an accomplice.\n\n     In my view, the majority has impermissibly veered away\nfrom the statute of conviction to find overbreadth based on\nits analysis of a statute that was not part of the prosecution\nor conviction in this case. Our analysis should have been on\nthe actual statute of conviction, Wash. Rev. Code\n\u00a7 69.50.401, which meets the definition of an aggravated\nfelony.\n\n    Indeed, our precedent makes it crystal clear that\nconviction of aiding and abetting is tantamount to conviction\nof the underlying offense. See Salazar-Luviano v. Mukasey,\n551 F.3d 857, 860 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008) (\u201cSalazar\u2019s aiding and\nabetting conviction is technically a violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2. That Salazar was convicted of aiding and abetting,\nhowever, makes him liable as a principal of the underlying\noffense.\u201d); see also Ortiz-Magana v. Mukasey, 542 F.3d 653,\n659 (9th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[Because] there is no material\ndistinction between an aider and abettor and principals in\nany jurisdiction of the United States . . . aiding and abetting\n\f26         UNITED STATES V. VALDIVIA-FLORES\n\nan [offense] is the functional equivalent of personally\ncommitting that offense [and] that offense . . . constitutes an\naggravated felony.\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\n    In Sales v. Sessions, 868 F.3d 779, 780 (9th Cir. 2017),\nwe recently considered a conviction for second degree\nmurder under California law. We noted that it was\nundisputed that a conviction for second degree murder is an\naggravated felony. See id. We then decided that a\nconviction for aiding and abetting second degree murder\n\u201calso qualifies as an aggravated felony.\u201d Id. We clarified\nthat \u201cabsent a showing that the law has been applied in some\n\u2018special\u2019 way, a conviction in California for aiding and\nabetting a removable offense is also a removable offense.\u201d\nId. We eschewed the defendant\u2019s reliance on Duenas-\nAlvarez, as we should do in this case because our holding in\nDuenas-Alvarez does not apply to our Taylor analysis here.\nSee id.\n\n     In Salazar-Luviano and in Ortiz-Magana, we discerned\nno reason to delve into the intricacies of the aiding and\nabetting statutes. Quite the opposite. As we explained in\nSalazar-Luviano in rejecting the government\u2019s attempt to\naddress the elements of the aiding and abetting statute, \u201c[t]he\ngovernment\u2019s observation that aiding and abetting is a\nspecific intent crime, is beside the point. Aiding and abetting\nis not a stand-alone offense\u2013one convicted of aiding and\nabetting is guilty of the underlying substantive offense as if\nhe committed it directly.\u201d 551 F.3d at 862 n.4 (citation,\nalteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The same\nis true in this case. Because aiding and abetting is not an\noffense in and of itself, the majority\u2019s focus on the elements\nof the Washington aiding and abetting statute is, as we\npreviously noted, \u201cbeside the point.\u201d Id. I respectfully\ndissent.\n\f",

In 1997, he was charged with and ultimately pled guilty to a violation of Washington\u2019s drug trafficking statute, Wash. Rev., Code \u00a7 69.50.401. In his Statement of Defendant on Plea of Guilty, Valdivia-Flores described the crime he was being charged with as: \u201cpossession with intent to. deliver\u2014Heroin.\u201d He also wrote out the elements of the crime: \u201cPossess a controlled substance (heroin) with intent to distribute it in King County and know it was a narcotic drug.\u201d Finally, stating what made him guilty of Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401 in his own words, Valdi-via-Flores wrote: \u201cOn June 20, 1997 in King County WA I did unlawfully possess with intent to deliver Heroin a controlled substance and did know it Was a controlled substance.*\u2019 Valdivia-Flores was sentenced to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, which \u2019 he served at an accelerated pace over seven months at a work ethic camp. While he was in the camp, immigration officers prepared a Notice to Appear which charged Valdivia-Flores with being removable. In an order dated January 28, 1998, an immigration judge suspended the immigration proceedings because Valdivia-Flores was still serving his sentence at the camp and therefore could not be produced for a hearing. Nonetheless, at the conclusion of his sentence in April 1998, immigration officers physically removed Valdi-via-Flores to Mexico without an order. Valdivia-Flores returned to the State of Washington that same year, again without inspection at the border. In 2009, Valdivia-Flores was convicted of malicious mischief in the third degree in violation of Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.48.090 for smashing the windshield of his wife\u2019s vehicle after an argument. He pled guilty, and his sentence was suspended. At the time of that prosecution, the Department of Homeland Security initiated administrative removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). In March 2009, he received two copies of a form, one in English and one in Spanish, titled Notice of Rights and Request for Disposition. This notice informed Valdivia-Flores that he had \u201cthe right to a hearing before the Immigration Court to determine whether [he] may remain in the United States.\u201d Valdivia-Flores filled out and signed the Spanish version of the form, electing to request a hearing before the Immigration Court. Also in March 2009, the Department of Homeland Security issued Valdivia-Flores a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final Administrative Removal Order (\u201cNotice of Intent\u201d). It stated that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s 1997 conviction under Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a) was for an aggravated felony so that he was removable without a hearing before an immigration judge. The Notice of Intent informed Valdivia-Flores of his right to petition for review of his removal in the appropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It also provided three check-boxes of options by which Valdivia-Flores could \u201ccontest [his] deportability\u201d: (1) he could assert that he was \u201ca citizen or national of the United States\u201d; (2) he could assert that he was \u201ca lawful permanent resident\u201d; and (3) he could claim that he was \u201cnot convicted of the criminal offense described\u201d in the Notice of Intent. Valdivia-Flores did not contest his removal or request withholding of removal and instead checked a box acknowledging that he had \u201cthe right to remain in the United States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for judicial review\u201d and that he \u201cwaive[d] this right.\u201d He did not petition for review of the removal decision and was removed on April 4, 2009. He remained in Mexico for a few days and then unlawfully reentered the United States for a third time. On August 13, 2013, Valdivia-Flores was arrested in Washington for being an illegal alien found in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He pled guilty and was convicted in the Western District of Washington in September 2013. Immigration authorities once again initiated removal proceedings. Valdivia-Flores requested asylum and sought a stay of removal \u201cfor humanitarian reasons,\u201d but those requests were denied, and Valdivia-Flores was removed in September 2014. On November 13, 2014, Valdivia-Flores attempted to return (for a fourth time) to the United States, applying for entry through the pedestrian lanes at the San Ysidiro, California port of entry. Valdivia-Flores falsely identified himself as another person and presented a false and fraudulent United States Certification of Naturalization. He was charged with one count of attempted reentry of a removed alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and one count of fraudulent use of an immigration document in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546. Prior to trial, Valdivia-Flores brought a collateral attack against the validity of his 2009 order of removal and moved to dismiss the attempted reentry count of the indictment. The district court denied the motion to dismiss because Valdivia-Flores \u201cdid in fact admit in his plea agreement to committing a drug trafficking offense, which is an aggravated felony.\u201d The parties then entered into a stipulation in which Valdivia-Flores agreed to facts satisfying all the elements of both counts in the indictment. Based on those stipulated facts, following a bench trial the district court found Valdivia-Flores guilty of both charges and sentenced him to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment on both counts, running concurrently. Valdivia-Flores filed this timely appeal and seeks to challenge collaterally the classification of his underlying Washington state conviction as an aggravated felony.1  II  Valdivia-Flores contends that because his 1997 conviction was incorrectly determined to be an aggravated felony, his 2009 removal was invalid. If the 2009 removal was invalid, that \u201cprecludes reliance on th[at] deportation\u201d in the subsequent illegal reentry prosecution. United States v. Ramos, 623 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2010). Valdivia-Flores\u2019s collateral attack is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d), which allows such an attack to succeed if Valdiviar-Flores can demonstrate that (1) he exhausted the administrative remedies available for seeking relief from the predicate removal order; (2) the removal proceedings improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the removal order was fundamentally unfair. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). The first two prongs of \u00a7 1326(d) are satisfied if his right to appeal was denied in violation of due process. United States v. Gomez, 757 F.3d 885, 893 (9th Cir. 2014).  Valdivia-Flores contends that his due process rights were indeed violated because \u201cimmigration officials failed to obtain a knowing waiver of\u2019 his right to appeal the removal order. Gomez, 757 F.3d at 893. \u201cIn order for [a] waiver to be valid ... it must be both considered and intelligent.\u201d United States v. Arrieta, 224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government contends that Valdivia-Flores did validly waive his right to appeal by signing the Notice of Intent, by failing to appeal, and by freely choosing instead to return to this country unlawfully.  Because Valdivia-Flores asserts that his waiver was not considered and intelligent, the government must show, by clear and convincing evidence that the waiver was valid, Ramos, 623 F.3d at 681, and it may not simply rely on the signed document purportedly agreeing to the waiver, Gomez, 757 F.3d at 895. Because we cannot rely on the contested waiver document itself, we evaluate the surrounding circumstances to determine whether the government can overcome the presumption against waiver. See Cisneros-Rodriguez, 813 F.3d at 756.  Here, although the Notice of Intent described the window in which Valdivia-Flores could respond to the charges against him or file a petition for judicial review, it did not explicitly inform him that he could refute, through either an administrative or judicial procedure, the legal conclusion underlying his removability. In fact, the Notice of Intent\u2019s three check boxes suggested just the opposite\u2014that removability could only be contested on factual grounds. The list of options available to \u201ccheck off\u2019 did \u25a0 not include an option to contest the classification of the conviction as an aggravated felony, and the only check box relevant to the conviction itself only allowed Valdivia-Flores to contest that- he \u201cwas not convicted of the criminal offense described.\u201d The form\u2019s deficiencies are magnified because Valdivia-Flores \u201cwas not represented and never had the benefit of appearing before an [immigration judge], who, we presume, would have adequately conveyed both [his] appeal options and the finality associated with waiving appeal.\u201d Ramos, 623 F.3d at 681 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the Notice of Intent was issued without a hearing before an immigration judge despite Valdivia-Flores\u2019s request for a hearing. The government provides no evidence that an immigration officer ever met with Valdivia-Flores to explain the form or the issues it raised; rather, the government merely relies on the sufficiency of the form\u2019s text to communicate Valdivia-Flores\u2019s options. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s waiver of the right to seek judicial review was not considered and intelligent. Accord Gomez, 757 F.3d at 896 (explaining that the fact that an alien signed a waiver was insufficient to meet the government\u2019s burden to establish a valid waiver when the record reflected deficiencies in the advisements given). Therefore, he was deprived of due process and satisfies the first two prongs of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). Ill A With a due process violation established,, the next step in Valdivia-Flores\u2019s argument is that the 2009 removal order \u201cwas fundamentally unfair,\u201d so he satisfies the final prong of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) to succeed in his collateral attack. He must \u201cshow that it was \u2018plausible\u2019 that he would have received some form of relief from removal had his rights not been violated in the removal proceedings.\u201d Gomez, 757 F.3d at 898 (quoting Arrieta, 224 F.3d at 1079). To meet that burden, Valdivia--Flores argues that, had he sought judicial review of the order, he would have prevailed in showing that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony as alleged in the Notice of Intent as the sole basis for his removal without a hearing before an immigration judge. The government disagrees and argues that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s drug trafficking conviction was properly classified as an aggravated felony. We must therefore determine whether Valdivia-Flores\u2019s 1997 conviction under Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401 -was for an aggravated felony.  To determine whether an offense qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d we apply the categorical approach articulated in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Rendon v. Holder, 764 F.3d 1077, 1082 (9th Cir. 2014). Under the categorical approach, \u201cwe look not to the facts of the particular prior case, but. instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.\u201d Roman-Suaste v. Holder, 766 F.3d 1035, 1038 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To make his argument that the Washington drug-trafficking law is broader than its federal analogue, .Valdivia-Flores observes that, under both the federal and state criminal laws, a person charged with a drug trafficking offense may be convicted either as a principal or for aiding and abetting. Critically, he says, Washington defines aiding and abetting more broadly than does federal law so that Washington forbids more conduct. The implicit nature of aiding and abetting liability in every criminal charge is sufficiently well-settled that the government in this case does not contest it. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 189, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007) (In the United States, \u201cevery jurisdiction\u2014all States and the Federal Government\u2014has expressly abrogated the distinction among principals and aiders and abettors.\u201d). Instead, the government contends that Washington\u2019s definition of aiding and abetting liability is essentially the same as the federal definition so that they do, in fact, match categorically. At the time of Valdivia-Flores\u2019s conviction, Washington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute stated: \u201cA person is an accomplice ... in the commission of a crime if ... [w]ith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime, he ... solicits, commands, encourages, or requests such other person to commit it; or aids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or committing it.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.020(3)(a)(i)-(ii) (1997) (emphasis added). In contrast, under federal law, \u201cto prove liability as an aider and abettor the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the specific intent to facilitate the commission of a crime by someone else.\u201d United States v. Garcia, 400 F.3d 816, 819 (9th Cir. 2005) (emphasis added). Therefore, federal law requires a mens rea of specific intent for conviction for aiding and abetting, whereas- Washington requires merely knowledge. Consistent with the Model Penal Code on which it is based, Washington\u2019s criminal law expressly codifies the distinction between intent and knowledge and makes plain that knowledge is a less 'demanding mens rea requirement. \u201cA person acts with intent or intentionally when he acts with the objective or purpose to accomplish a result which constitutes a crime.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.010(l)(a) (1997)' (emphasis added). In contrast, \u201c[a] person knows or acts knowingly or with knowledge when ... (i) he is aware of a1 fact, facts, or circumstances or result described by a statute defining an offense; or (ii) he has information which would lead a reasonable man in the same situation to believe that facts exist-which facts are described by a statute defining an offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9A.08.010(l)(b) (emphasis added). The same distinction exists in federal law, There, \u201ca person who causes a particular result is said to act purposefully\u201d\u2014or with specific intent\u2014\u201cif he consciously desires that result ... while he is said to act knowingly if he is aware that that result is practically certain to follow from his conduct, whatever his desire may be as to that result.\u201d United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 404, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Abagninin v. AMVAC Chem. Corp., 545 F.3d 733, 739 (9th Cir. 2008) (distinguishing specific intent from \u201cmere knowledge, or general intent\u201d). Therefore, the Washington drug trafficking law* on its face appears to have a more inclusive mens rea requirement for accomplice liability than-its federal analogue. The Washington Supreme Court\u2019s case law indicates that the distinction between intent and knowledge is meaningful.2 See State v. Thomas, 166 Wash.2d 380, 208 P.3d 1107, 1111 (2009) (\u201cTo convict an accomplice of premeditated murder in the first degree, the State need not show that the accomplice had the intent that the victim would be killed. The prosecution need only prove that the defendant knew his actions would facilitate the crime .... \u201d); State v. Roberts, 142 Wash.2d 471, 14 P.3d 713, 731-32 (2000) (\u201cThe accomplice liability statute requires only a mens rea of knowledge .... [A]n accomplice, like a felony murder defendant, may be convicted with a lesser mens rea and a lesser actus reus than a principal to premeditated first degree murder.\u201d); State v. Gocken, 127 Wash.2d 95, 896 P.2d 1267, 1273-74 (1995) (\u201cCriminal conspiracy requires an element of intent, while accomplice liability requires a lesser culpable state of knowledge\u201d). B The government\u2019s principal response to this statutory language and case law is to cite contrary Washington case law that suggests accomplice liability turns on a mens rea standard closer to intent than knowledge. E.g., In re Welfare of Wilson, 91 Wash.2d 487, 588 P.2d 1161, 1164 (1979) (\u201c[I]t is the encouragement plus the intent of the bystander to encourage that constitutes abetting.\u201d); State v. Truong, 168 Wash.App. 529, 277 P.3d 74, 79-80 (2012) (\u201c[T]he State must prove that the defendant ... shared in the criminal intent of the principal, thus demonstrating a community of unlawful purpose at the time the act was committed.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Washington Supreme Court cases the government cites, however, significantly predate the above-quoted authoritative interpretations by that court, and in some cases they even predate the 1976 enactment of Washington\u2019s modern accomplice liability statute. The more recent state intermediate appellate court cases are also less authoritative than the clear statements of Washington\u2019s highest court. We are satisfied that the government\u2019s cited case law is less authoritative than the more recent Washington Supreme Court cases that indicate a clear distinction between the mental states of intent and knowledge.  In the face of the clear statutory language and the most authoritative state case law, the government argues as a fallback that\u2014even if there is a formal distinction between the state and federal mens rea requirements\u2014in practice, Washington\u2019s law does not \u201cextend significantly beyond\u201d its federal analogue for purposes of categorical comparison. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815. Whatever the metaphysical merit of the government\u2019s attack on the distinction between intent and knowledge, we have held that, \u201cwhere, as here, a state statute explicitly defines a crime more broadly than the generic definition, no \u2018legal imagination\u2019 is required to hold that a realistic probability exists that the state will apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of the crime.\u201d United States v. Grisel, 488 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815). Because the difference in breadth is apparent on the face of the statute, we must conclude that Washington\u2019s statute is broader than its federal analogue. Finally, the government makes a pragmatic argument that, under Valdivia-Flores\u2019s proposed application of the categorical approach, \u201cno Washington state conviction can serve as an aggravated\u2019felony at all because of [the] accomplice liability statute\u201d and that such a result \u201ccannot have been Congress\u2019s intent.\u201d The government here merely joins a chorus of those who \u201chave raised concerns about [the] line of decisions\u201d applying the categorical approach, \u201c[b]ut whether for good or for ill, the elements-based approach remains the law.\u201d Mathis v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2257, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016). Indeed, Justice Kennedy wrote separately in Mathis to note specifically that Congress \u201ccould not have intended vast ... disparities for defendants convicted of identical criminal 'conduct in different jurisdictions\u201d; but he concurred in the opinion that held that the categorical approach required just that result. Id. at 2258 (Kennedy, J., concurring). As an inferior court, we must follow suit. Under a straightforward application of the categorical approach, Washington\u2019s drug trafficking statute is overbroad compared to its federal analogue, and Valdi-via-Flores\u2019s conviction cannot support an aggravated felony determination.3  C The district court\u2019s ruling, however, was based on a somewhat alternative analysis: applying the modified categorical approach, which permits a court to look at the documents of conviction. Using those, the district court determined that Valdi-via-Flores was, in fact, convicted as a principal rather than an accomplice and so fell within the federal generic drug trafficking prohibition. It is only \u201c[i]n a narrow range of cases\u201d\u2019 however, \u201cwhen the statute at issue is divisible,\u201d that a court \u201cmay employ\u201d the modified categorical approach to look at the underlying documents of conviction.4 Ramirez v. Lynch, 810 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2016). Where a \u201cstatutory phrase ... refers to multiple, alternative means of commission\u201d of the crime, it must \u201cbe regarded as indivisible if the jurors need not agree on which method of committing the offense the defendant used.\u201d Rendon, 764 F.3d at 1085. Washington law.is clear'that jurors need not agree. on whether a defendant is a principal or accomplice. See State v. Hoffman, 116 Wash.2d 51, 804 P.2d 577, 605 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not necessary that jurors be unanimous as to the manner of an accomplice\u2019s - and a principal\u2019s participation as long as all agree that they did participate in the .crime.\u201d). Because a jury need not distinguish between principals and accomplices, the .drug trafficking statute is not divisible so far as the distinction between those roles is concerned, so the modified categorical approach may not be applied, and it was error for the district court to do so.5  IV Because Valdiviar-Flores\u2019s drug trafficking conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the categorical approach, it cannot support the asserted basis for Valdivia-Flores\u2019s 2009 removal. Valdiviar-Flores was therefore prejudiced from his inability to seek judicial review for that removal. He thus satisfies all three elements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d), and his collateral attack on the underlying deportation order should have been successful. The judgment of the' district court is therefore REVERSED and the case. REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  . \"We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment brought pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) de novo.\u201d United States v. Cisneros-Rodriguez, 813 F.3d 748, 755 (9th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). Whether a crime constituted an aggravated felony is a question of law reviewed de novo. See Wang v. Rodriguez, 830 F.3d 958, 960 (9th Cir. 2016).   . State statutes and the state court decisions interpreting them are both \"authoritative sources of state law.\u201d Mathis v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2256, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016).   . Our dissenting colleague rejects potential differences between Washington and federal aiding and abetting liability on the ground that we should look no further than the state statute defining the principal offense of drug trafficking, which does match its federal analogue. But as the dissent points out, \u201cconviction of aiding and abetting is tantamount to conviction of the underlying offense.\u201d It is for just that reason that, under the categorical approach, \"the criminal activities of ... aiders and abettors of a generic\u201d offense \u201cmust themselves fall within the scope of the [analogue] federal statute.\u201d Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 190, 127 S.Ct. 815. The test under Taylor is straightforward in this context: \"[i]f the state statute criminalizes conduct that would not constitute a drug trafficking offense under federal ... law, then a prior conviction under that statute does not categorically qualify\u201d as an aggravated felony. United States v. Valdavinos-Torres, 704 F.3d 679, 691 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the Washington statute does criminalize conduct that would not constitute a drag offense under federal law\u2014due to the distinct aiding and abetting definitions\u2014it is over-broad. That we have rejected an overbreadth challenge to this Washington statute before is irrelevant because such challenge was based on an argument unrelated to the overbreadth of the aiding and abetting component of the statute. See United States v. Burgos-Ortega, 777 F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th Cir. 2015) (considering an overbreadth challenge because the Washington statute did not include same exemption for \"administering\u201d a drag as its federal analogue).   . The dissent argues \"that documents in the record relevant to ValdiviarFlores\u2019 conviction leave little doubt that he was convicted as a . .principal, and not as an accomplice.\u201d We may not consider such documents, of course, if the statute is not divisible.   . That conclusion comports with our prior holding regarding federal aiding and abetting liability outside of the immigration context, where we have held that \"[a]iding and abetting ... is simply one means of committing a ... crime.\u201d Garcia, 400 F.3d at 820.

            "opinion_text": " O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge, specially concurring. Although the result in this case is dictated by the case law of the Supreme Court and our Circuit, I write separately to highlight how it illustrates the bizarre and arbitrary effects of the ever-spreading categorical approach for comparing state law offenses to federal criminal definitions. I am hardly the first federal circuit judge, to express puzzlement at how the categorical approach has come to be applied. See, e.g., United States v. Doctor, 842 F.3d 306, 312 (4th Cir. 2016) (Wilkinson, J., concurring); United States v. Faust, 853 F.3d 39, 60 (1st Cir. 2017) (Lynch, J., concurring); United States v. Chapman, 866 F.3d 129, 136 (3d Cir. 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring). That criticism arises largely in relation to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U,S.C. \u00a7 924(e)\u2014in- which context the categorical approach was created to apply sentencing enhancements based on prior state convictions\u2014but the case before us illustrates the much broader reach of its peculiar consequences. Almost three decades ago, in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court developed the categorical approach in the context of ACCA, which imposes heightened mandatory m\u00ednimums for serious repeat offenders. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Two decades later, 'it had become clear that the same approach applied to determine what state crimes fell within certain categories enumerated in the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 187, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007). Several justices of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the \u201carbitrary and inequitable results produced by applying\u201d the categorical' approach to the ACCA sentencing scheme. Mathis v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2258, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting similar criticisms raised in dissent by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito). The results can be even more arbitrary in other contexts, including the case before us involving a collateral attack on a removal order. - As Judge Wilkinson observed in his criticism of the present state of the categorical approach, when it comes to ACCA and sentencing, a district court \u201chas various tools to impose a stricter sentence if it believes that the categorical approach is ignoring a violent criminal history or dis-serving the general aims of sentencing.\u201d Doctor, 842 F.3d at 317 (Wilkinson, J., concurring). Under the advisory sentencing guidelines, a district court can depart outside the guidelines to correct for a particularly unjust or absurd application of the categorical approach. In the context of the case before us, however, there is no way to remedy an especially absurd result of applying the categorical approach. When a removal premised on a prior state conviction for an aggravated felony is collaterally attacked years later, a court\u2019s only role once reaching the merits is to apply the categorical approach and to determine if. the state statute of conviction was a categorical match with its federal analogue. As today\u2019s decision makes clear, if the challenger is clever enough to find some space in the state statutory scheme that lies outside the federal analogue, he can effectively void that prior removal for purposes of his present illegal reentry prosecution-even though the challenger admits that the actual conduct underlying his state conviction falls at the heart of the federal analogue. There is no discretion to be exercised. Congress made clear its desire to remove aliens who have committed \u201caggravated felonies,\u201d which it expressly defined to include any \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), meaning \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\u201d 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 924. Nobody contests .that ,Valdivia-Flores possessed heroin with intent to deliver it, nor that such conduct is indeed a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. There is no reason to doubt, then, that Valdivia-Flores actually did commit an aggravated felony. Because of the judicially-created categorical approach and a quirk in the drafting of Washington\u2019s statutory scheme, however, he escapes the consequences that Congress intended for such conduct. Whatever the merits of' the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for imposing the categorical approach on sentencing under ACCA, where judges have discretion to correct for particularly arbitrary and unjust results, the effect is far more pernicious in cases such as this one where there is no chance for correction. Shouldn\u2019t it be possible to have a more \u201cpractical reading\u201d of the Immigration and Nationality Act so that, \u201c[w]hen it is clear that a. defendant necessarily admitted or the jury necessarily found that the .defendant committed the elements of [the generic federal crime], the conviction should qualify\u201d for purposes of classifying it as an aggravated felony? Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2295, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013) (Alito, J., dissenting). If the Supreme Court is unwilling to revisit the categorical approach for cases such as this one, Congress should consider clarifying whether it truly intended radically different treatment for aliens \u201cconvicted of identical criminal conduct in different jurisdictions.\u201d Mathis, 136 S.Ct. at 2258 (Kennedy, J., concurring).

            "opinion_text": " RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting: Jose Valdivia-Flores was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance in violation of Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401. The majority describes our task as \u201cdetermin[ing] whether Valdi-via-Flores\u2019 conviction under Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401 was for an aggravated felony.\u201d Majority Opinion, p. 1206. Yet, inexplicably, the majority completely fails to address that statute. In determining whether Valdivia-Flores was convicted of an aggraved felony, we compare the state statute of conviction to the generic federal definition of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. See Roman-Suaste v. Holder, 766 F.3d 1035, 1038 (9th Cir. 2014). The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); see also Roman-Suaste, 766 F.3d at 1038. The phrase \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d supplies the generic federal description of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, defined in pertinent part as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2); see also Roman-Suaste, 766 F.3d at 1038. A \u201cfelony\u201d includes an offense for which the maximum term of imprisonment is \u201cmore than one year.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(5); see also Roman-Suaste, 766 F.3d at 1038. Ultimately, \u201cunder the plain language of these provisions, a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony when it is for an offense that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes punishable by more than one year\u2019s .imprisonment.\u201d United States v. Gonzalez-Corn, 807 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2015) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The pertinent CSA provision in this case, provides: \u201cExcept as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally ... to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent t\u00f3 manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u25a0 841(a)(1). The Washington statute underlying Valdivia-Flores\u2019 1997 conviction, stated in pertinent part: \u201cExcept as authorized by this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a) (1997). Washington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute stated at the time of Valdivia-Flores\u2019 conviction: \u201cA person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a crime if ... [wjith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime, he ... [sjolicits, commands, encourages, or requests such other person to commit it; or [ajids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or committing it.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.020(3)(a)(i)-(ii) (1997). Valdivia-Flores does not vigorously challenge the notion that a drug trafficking offense constitutes an aggravated felony. Rather, he contends that'our categorical analysis should focus on Washington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute, which he argues is implicit in Washington\u2019s drug trafficking statute. Valdivia-Flores relies heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007). He further contends'that the implicit aiding and abetting liability is ovei\u2019broad and indivisible, The majority goes astray by accepting Valdivia-Flores\u2019 argument. Reliance on Duenas-Alvarez as authority to support focusing our categorical analysis on Washington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute is misplaced. In Duenas-Alvarez, the Supreme Court held that a \u201ctheft offense\u201d includes the crime of aiding and abetting a theft offense. 549 U.S. at 189-90, 127 S.Ct. 815. However, the statute at issue provided in pertinent part: Any person who drives or takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle, or any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing, is guilty of a public offense. Id. at 187, 127 S.Ct. 815 (quoting Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a7 10851(a)) (some emphasis added). Importantly, the language supporting an analysis of aiding and abetting liability came directly from the statute underlying Duenas-Alvarez\u2019s conviction. See id. Thus, the Supreme Court compared Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a7 10851(a), the statute of conviction, to the generic definition of a theft offense, consistent with a traditional categorical analysis. See id. at 189-94, 127 S.Ct. 815. The majority compares Washington\u2019s aiding and abetting statute\u2014a statute that Valdivia admitted is a separate statute from the statute of conviction\u2014to the generic definition of aiding and abetting. See Majority Opinion, pp. 1206-09. As the district court observed in United States v. Gonzalez-Altamirano, No. 14CR 750-BEN, 2014 WL 7047636 at *5 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2014): Defendant ... asks the Court to go beyond the Washington statute of conviction, look at a different statute, find that it impliedly applies to every offense, and find the application of the implication carries the conviction beyond the federal generic drug trafficking offense. To borrow a phrase, this argument requires the sort of theoretical possibility that was cautioned against in Gonzalez v. Duenas-Alvarez.... (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Tellingly, as in Gonzalez-Altami-rano, the majority cites no precedent skipping over the actual statute of conviction to plug a completely different statute into the Taylor analysis. See 2014 WL 7047636 at *4. Further detracting from the majority\u2019s conclusion, we have explicitly determined that a conviction under Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401 qualifies as a conviction for an aggravated felony in a different context. See United States v. Burgos-Ortega, 777 F.3d 1047, 1054-55 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2848, 192 L.Ed.2d 883 (2015) (upholding a sentence enhancement). Unlike the majority, we rejected the argument that the statute was categorically overbroad. See id. It is also worth mentioning that documents in the record relevant to Valdivia-Flores\u2019 conviction leave little doubt that he' was convicted as a principal and not as an accomplice. The information charged Val-divia-Flores with unlawfully and felo-niously possessing with the intent to manufacture or deliver heroin in violation of Wash. Rev.- Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1). The Plea Statement signed by Valdivia-Flores contains a handwritten acknowledgment that he was charged with possession of heroin with intent to deliver, stating the elements of-the crime, and describing in his own words that he did \u201cunlawfully possess with intent to deliver Heroin\u201d knowing that it was a controlled substance. In a stipulation of facts provided to the district court, Valdivia-Flores agreed that on August 8, 1997, he suffered a felony conviction for Possession with Intent to Deliver Heroin, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401(a). Finally, the state court\u2019s judgment and sentence documented that Valdivia-Flores was convicted of Possession with Intent to Deliver Heroin in violation of Wash. Rev. Code' \u00a7 69.50.401(a)(1). Noticeably, no evidence in the record refers to Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.08.020 or suggests that Valdivia-Flores was convicted as an accomplice. In my view, the majority has impermis-sibly veered away from the statute of conviction to find overbreadth based on its analysis of a statute that was not part of the prosecution or conviction in this case. Our analysis should have been on the actual statute of conviction, Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50,401, which meets the; definition of an aggravated felony. \u25a0 Indeed, our precedent makes it crystal clear that conviction of aiding and abetting is tantamount to conviction of the underlying offense. See Salazar-Luviano v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 857, 860 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008) (\u201cSalazar\u2019s aiding and abetting conviction is technically a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 -2. That Salazar was convicted of aiding and abetting, however, makes him liable as a principal of the underlying offense.\u201d); see also Ortiz-Magana v. Mukasey, 542 F.3d 653, 659 (9th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[Because] there is no material distinction between an aider and abettor and principals in any jurisdiction of the United States ... aiding and abetting an [offense] is the functional equivalent of personally committing that offense [and] that offense ,... constitutes an aggravated felony.\u201d) (emphasis added). In Sales v. Sessions, 868 F.3d 779, 780 (9th Cir. 2017), we recently considered a conviction for second degree murder under California .law. We noted that it was undisputed that a conviction for second degree murder is an aggravated felony. See id. We then decided that a conviction for aiding and abetting second degree murder \u201calso qualifies as an aggravated felony.\u201d Id. We clarified that \u201cabsent a showing that the law has been applied, in some \u2018special\u2019 way, a conviction in California for aiding and abetting a removable offense is also a removable offense.\u201d Id. We eschewed the defendants reliance on Due-nas-Alvarez, as we should do in this case because our holding in Duenas-Alvarez does not apply to our Taylor analysis here. See id. In Salazar-Lmiano and in Ortiz-Maga-na, we discerned no reason to delve into the intricacies of the aiding and abetting statutes. Quite the opposite. \"As we explained in Salazar-Luviano in. rejecting the government\u2019s attempt to address the elements of the aiding and abetting statute, \u201c[t]he government\u2019s observation that aiding and abetting is a specific intent crime, is beside the point. Aiding and abetting is not a stand-alone offense-one convicted of aiding and abetting is guilty of the underlying substantive offense as if he committed it directly.\u201d 551 F.3d at 862 n.4 (citation, alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The same is true in this case. Because aiding and abetting is not an offense in and of itself, the majority\u2019s focus on the elements of the Washington aiding and abetting statute is, as we previously noted, \u201cbeside the point.\u201d Id. I respectfully dissent. ",
