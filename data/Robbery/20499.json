appellant Robert Warren Hildebrand asserts that the\r\ntrial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.\u00a0 We affirm. \r\n\r\nI.\u00a0 Factual and Procedural\r\nBackground\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAround 2:00 a.m. on May 27, 2005, Marci Massengalle was\r\npulling into her subdivision in Baytown when a red truck sped down the road,\r\nhit the curb, and ran into a parked Suburban.\u00a0 The truck fled the scene.\u00a0\r\nMassengalle called 9-1-1 and followed the truck until the police arrived.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Baytown Police Officer Russell Krutsinger responded and\r\nimmediately went to the scene to locate the red truck.\u00a0 He spotted a red Chevy\r\npick-up truck which matched the description given over the dispatch.\u00a0 After\r\nnoticing the truck swerving in its own lane of traffic, Officer Krutsinger\r\nactivated his video camera and emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop.\u00a0\r\nHe requested the individual (appellant) to exit the vehicle.\u00a0 Officer\r\nKrutsinger noticed that when appellant exited the vehicle, he used the truck\r\nfor support, which gave the officer an indication that appellant may have been\r\ndrinking.\u00a0 Officer Myron Hellman arrived at the scene around the same time.\u00a0\r\nOfficer Hellman, however, did not get involved with the investigation of appellant\r\nat this time, but stayed back to interview Massengalle regarding the\r\nhit-and-run and to determine whether there was any damage to the Suburban. \r\n\r\nOfficer Krutsinger asked appellant if he had been drinking,\r\nand appellant replied that he had consumed approximately three, twenty-ounce\r\nbeers.\u00a0 According to standard procedure for officer safety, Officer Krutsinger\r\npatted appellant down.\u00a0 He felt an object in appellant=s pocket.\u00a0 He\r\nasked appellant what it was, and appellant replied that it could be a lighter.\u00a0\r\nAfter reaching into appellant=s pocket, Officer Krutsinger confirmed\r\nthis fact.\u00a0 Appellant thereafter willingly performed several field sobriety\r\ntests, which were captured on videotape.\u00a0 At the conclusion of the tests,\r\nOfficer Krutsinger handcuffed and placed appellant in the backseat of the\r\npatrol car in order to wait for a tow truck to come for appellant=s vehicle.\u00a0\r\nOfficer Hellman went back to the police station. \r\n\r\n\u00a0After the tow truck arrived, Officer Krutsinger brought\r\nappellant to the Baytown jail for further investigation.\u00a0 Upon arriving at the\r\nstation, appellant was read statutory warnings and asked if he wished to give a\r\nbreath specimen.\u00a0 Appellant refused to answer as to whether he would give a\r\nspecimen and became very belligerent. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficer Krutsinger, noticing a strong odor of alcohol on\r\nappellant=s breath, walked him to the Avideo room@ where appellant was\r\nasked to perform another series tests, which also were captured on videotape.\u00a0\r\nAppellant, although antagonistic, completed all of the tests.\u00a0 Appellant,\r\nhowever, refused to answer some questions, while answering others.\u00a0 Near the\r\nconclusion of the station video, appellant was read his rights, asked if he\r\nunderstood these rights, and whether he wished to waive them.\u00a0 Appellant\r\nresponded in the negative, and the officers ceased questioning.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Appellant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of\r\ndriving while intoxicated (ADWI@).\u00a0 Appellant\r\npleaded Anot guilty.@\u00a0 The jury found\r\nappellant guilty as charged, and the trial court sentenced appellant to\r\none-hundred eighty days= confinement in the Harris County Jail,\r\nsuspended his sentence by placing him on community supervision for one year,\r\nand assessed a fine of $600.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nPrior to trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress all\r\noral statements he made on the videos at the scene and at the police station,\r\ncontending that he was arrested without being given his Miranda warnings,\r\nand that he had invoked his right to be silent at the station by refusing to\r\nanswer some questions.\u00a0 The trial court conducted a hearing on this motion\r\nduring two portions of the trial, and made the following conclusions: \r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The traffic stop of appellant=s vehicle was supported by\r\nreasonable suspicion based on dispatch information regarding a red truck\r\n(similar to the one driven by appellant) hitting a Suburban and fleeing the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appellant was legally detained based on\r\nreasonable suspicion. \r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The search of appellant=s pocket did not escalate appellant=s legal detention to an illegal\r\narrest without a warrant or probable cause, but the product of the searchCthe lighterCwould be suppressed. \r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The parties could not offer any testimony in\r\nregard to interpretation of the field sobriety tests performed by appellant on\r\nthe scene video (State=s Exhibit 2) and on the station\r\nvideo (State=s Exhibit 3). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appellant did not invoke his right to remain\r\nsilent at the station by refusing to answer some questions, because Ain order to invoke the right to\r\nremain silent, a person must do more than just remain silent,@ and appellant did not invoke his\r\nright to remain silent until the end of the station video whenCafter being read his rightsCappellant responded that he did not\r\nwish to waive any of his rights.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The videos were admissible, except for the\r\naudio portion during the part in which appellant was read his rights and\r\nrefused to waive such rights. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nII. Standard of Review \r\n\r\nWe review the trial court=s ruling on a\r\nmotion to suppress under an abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion standard. \u00a0Long\r\nv. State, 823 S.W.2d 259, 277 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). If supported\r\nby the record, a trial court=s ruling on a motion to suppress will not\r\nbe overturned. \u00a0Brooks v. State, 76 S.W.3d 426, 430 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th\r\nDist.] 2002, no pet.).\u00a0 At a suppression hearing, the trial court is the sole\r\nfinder of fact and is free to believe or disbelieve any or all of the evidence\r\npresented.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 We give almost total deference to the trial court=s determination of\r\nhistorical facts that depend on credibility and demeanor, but review de novo\r\nthe trial court=s application of the law to the facts if\r\nresolution of those ultimate questions does not turn on the evaluation of\r\ncredibility and demeanor.\u00a0 See Guzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85, 89 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1997).\r\n\r\nIII.\u00a0 Issue and Analysis \r\n\r\nIn a single issue, appellant contends that, because he was\r\nunder arrest and was not given his Miranda and Texas Criminal Code of\r\nProcedure Article 38.22 warnings, all oral statements should have been\r\nsuppressed.\u00a0 Appellant appeals the trial court=s denial of his\r\nmotion to suppress stating that: \r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any arrest was illegal because the officers\r\ndid not have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to stop him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was arrested at the time of the initial\r\nstop because Officer Krutsinger did not have the authority to issue a citation\r\nfor the hit-and-run accident or release him.\u00a0 Appellant states that under\r\nsection 543.002 and 543.003 of Texas Transportation Code, an officer lacks\r\ndiscretion to issue a citation in a case involving a person who leaves the\r\nscene where there is property damage.\u00a0 Therefore, when the law requires an\r\narrest, and the officer holds no discretion not to arrest, an objective person\r\nwould believe he was under arrest.\r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Officer Krutsinger reached into\r\nappellant=s pocket at the scene without a\r\nwarrant or probable cause, appellant was placed under arrest, and he should\r\nhave been read his Miranda warnings.\u00a0 Because he was under arrest at\r\nthis point, and not read his warnings, everything following this moment (at the\r\nscene and in station videos), including statements, acts, or refusals to\r\ncooperate, should have been suppressed.\r\n\r\n!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He invoked\r\nhis right to be silent at the station by refusing to answer some questions on\r\nthe video, thus all oral statements and refusals to cooperate on the station\r\nvideo should have been suppressed.\r\n\r\nA.\u00a0\r\nWas appellant legally detained or unlawfully arrested?\r\n\r\nAppellant contends that he was under arrest either at the\r\ntime of the initial stop for leaving the scene, or, in the alternative, at the\r\ntime of the search.\u00a0 He states that because he was under arrest and not given\r\nhis warnings, all oral statements and refusals to cooperate on the videos made\r\nat the scene and at the stationCafter the time of the allegedly illegal\r\narrestC should have been\r\nsuppressed.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteractions between police and civilians are divided into\r\nthree categories: (1) encounters, (2) investigative detentions, and (3)\r\narrests.\u00a0 See State v. Larue, 28 S.W.3d 549, 553 n.8 (Tex. Crim. App.\u00a0\r\n2000).\u00a0 AA person is\r\narrested when he has been actually placed under restraint or taken into custody\r\nby an officer or person executing a warrant of arrest, or by an officer or\r\nperson arresting without a warrant.@\u00a0 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 15.22\r\n(Vernon 2005).\u00a0 However, this Arestraint of liberty@ standard is not\r\nadequate when distinguishing between an arrest and a detention because it is a\r\ncharacteristic common to both.\u00a0 Dang v. State, 99 S.W.3d 172, 180 (Tex.\r\nApp.CHouston [14th\r\nDist.] 2003), rev'd on other grounds, 154 S.W.3d 616 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2005); Green v. State, No. 14\u201103\u201100213\u2011CR, 2004 WL 1381021,\r\nat *4 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] Jun. 22, 2004, pet.\r\nref=d) (not designated\r\nfor publication).\u00a0 Whether a person is under arrest or subject to a temporary\r\ninvestigative detention is a matter of degree and depends upon the length of\r\nthe detention, the amount of force employed, and whether the officer actually\r\nconducts an investigation. \u00a0See Woods v. State, 970 S.W.2d 770, 775\r\n(Tex. App.CAustin 1998, pet. ref=d).\u00a0 Likewise,\r\nwhether a detention is an actual arrest or an investigative detention depends\r\non the reasonableness of the intrusion under all of the facts. \u00a0See Rhodes\r\nv. State, 945 S.W.2d 115, 118 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Was\r\nappellant under arrest at the time of the initial stop for fleeing the scene of\r\nthe hit-and-run? \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appellant\r\nfirst contends that he was under arrest for Fourth Amendment purposes at the\r\ninitial stop for fleeing the scene of a hit-and-run accident involving an\r\nunattended vehicle.\u00a0 Appellant relies on sections 543.002 and 543.003 of the\r\nTexas Transportation Code to assert that, because Officer Krutsinger lacked the\r\nauthority to issue a citation and release him, an arrest was mandatory.\u00a0 See\r\nTex. Transp. Code Ann. '' 543.002, 543.003\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2006).\u00a0 Appellant argues that, because an arrest was mandatory\r\nand he was not read his rights, the videos and his oral statements should have\r\nbeen suppressed. \r\n\r\nAppellant was stopped and pulled over because Officer\r\nKrutsinger, at the very least, had reasonable suspicion to believe that\r\nappellant=s red truck had been involved in a hit-and-run\r\naccident with a Suburban.\u00a0 See id. ' 550.024.\u00a0 Section\r\n550.024 states as follows: \r\n\r\n(a) The operator of a vehicle that collides with and damages an\r\nunattended vehicle shall immediately stop and:\r\n\r\n(1) locate the operator or owner of the unattended vehicle and give\r\nthat person the name and address of the operator and the owner of the vehicle\r\nthat struck the unattended vehicle; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) leave in a conspicuous place in, or securely attach in a plainly\r\nvisible way to, the unattended vehicle a written notice giving the name and\r\naddress of the operator and the owner of the vehicle that struck the unattended\r\nvehicle and a statement of the circumstances of the collision.\r\n\r\n(b) A person commits an offense if the person violates Subsection (a).\u00a0\r\nAn offense under this section is:\r\n\r\n(1) a Class C misdemeanor, if the damage to all vehicles involved is\r\nless than $200; or\r\n\r\n(2) a Class B misdemeanor, if the damage to all vehicles involved is\r\n$200 or more.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\u00a0Sections\r\n543.002 and 543.003 set up the procedure that an officer must follow should he\r\narrest someone for committing an offense under Section 550.024, or another\r\nviolation of this subtitle.\u00a0 More specifically, section 543.002(a) provides as\r\nfollows: \r\n\r\nA person arrested for a violation of this subtitle punishable as a\r\nmisdemeanor shall be immediately taken before a magistrate if:\r\n\r\n(1) the person is arrested on a charge of failure to stop in the event\r\nof an accident causing damage to property; or\r\n\r\n(2) the person demands an immediate appearance before a magistrate or\r\nrefuses to make a written promise to appear in court as provided by this\r\nsubchapter.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nId. ' 543.002 (emphasis added).\u00a0 Section 543.003 provides\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nAn officer who arrests a person for a violation of this subtitle\r\npunishable as a misdemeanor and who does not take the person before a\r\nmagistrate shall issue a written notice to appear in court showing the time and\r\nplace the person is to appear, the offense charged, the name and address of\r\nthe person charged, and, if applicable, the license number of the person's\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\nId. ' 543.003 (emphasis\r\nadded).\u00a0 Appellant contends that under these statutes, it was mandatory to\r\narrest him, and because he was arrested for purposes of Miranda and\r\nArticle 38.22, all of his statements should have been suppressed.\u00a0 We disagree\r\nwith appellant=s interpretation of these statutes.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen discerning the meaning of a statute, the reviewing\r\ncourt should begin its analysis by looking at the plain language of the statute\r\nin question.\u00a0 Ex Parte Whiteside, 12 S.W.3d 819, 821 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2000).\u00a0 If the statute is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of its words\r\nshould be applied. \u00a0Boykin v. State, 818 S.W.2d 782, 785 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1991).\u00a0 If, however, the plain language of a statute would lead to absurd\r\nresults that the legislature could not possibly have intended or if the\r\nlanguage is not plain but rather ambiguous, a court may consider extratextual\r\nfactors. \u00a0Id. at 785B86.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 Under the unambiguous language of these statutes, an\r\nofficer is not required to arrest a person who violates section 550.024.\u00a0\r\nSections 543.002 and 543.003 set forth the procedure that officers must follow if\r\nthey arrest an individual for committing an offense under section 550.024.\u00a0\r\nSection 543.002 states that a person who is arrested should be taken\r\nimmediately before a magistrate under certain circumstances.\u00a0 Under section\r\n543.003, if an officer arrests a person and does not take that person before a\r\nmagistrate, the officer shall issue a written notice showing the time and place\r\nthe person is to appear in court.\u00a0 See Tex.\r\nTransp. Code Ann. '' 543.002, 543.003.\u00a0 These statutes do not\r\nmake it mandatory for an officer to arrest someone for colliding with a vehicle\r\nand failing to stop; rather, they state that such an offense is a misdemeanor,\r\nand that an officer who decides to arrest an individual based on this offense\r\nmust follow certain procedures.[1]\u00a0\r\nSee Berrett v. State, 152 S.W.3d 600, 606, 607 (Tex. App.CHouston [1st\r\nDist.] 2004, no pet.) (concluding that under section 543.003, a peace officer,\r\nin lieu of a custodial arrest may issue a citation or a written notice to\r\nappear before a magistrate to a defendant who commits a Class C misdemeanor).\u00a0\r\nWe conclude that an arrest was not mandatory, and appellant was not under\r\narrest at the time of initial stop for leaving the scene of the alleged\r\noffense.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt most, appellant was under investigation for the\r\npossibility of committing a misdemeanorCfailure to stop\r\nand leave information for the owner of the unattended Suburban that he\r\nallegedly hit.[2]\u00a0\r\nAt the time of the stop, Officer Krutsinger was conducting an investigation\r\nbased on reasonable suspicion that appellant may have committed a traffic\r\noffense based on a detailed dispatch he had received.\u00a0 Officer Krutsinger had\r\ninformation that a red pick-up truck had hit a parked Suburban and fled the\r\nscene.\u00a0 After receiving this dispatch, he was justified and had reasonable\r\nsuspicion to stop appellant, who was driving a red truck in the area of the\r\noffense.\u00a0 See McVickers v. State, 874 S.W.2d 662, 664 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1993) (finding that if an officer has a reasonable basis for suspecting a\r\nperson has committed a traffic offense, the officer may legally initiate a\r\ntraffic stop); Mann v. State, 525 S.W.2d 174, 176 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975)\r\n(concluding that officers, upon receiving an anonymous call, were justified in\r\ninitiating an investigation by proceeding to hunt for a car and occupants\r\nfitting the description given over the phone); Louis v. State, 825\r\nS.W.2d 752, 754B55 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th\r\nDist.] 1992, no pet.) (concluding that evidence supported trial court=s finding that\r\npolice officer=s initial stop of a light tan Cadillac was legal when\r\nit was the only car on the street where a robbery had occurred and it was\r\nreported that the robbery suspects were driving a white Oldsmobile).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nBecause appellant was not under arrest, but only under\r\ninvestigative detention at the time of the stop, his rights under Miranda and\r\nArticle 38.22 had not been implicated.\u00a0 Thus, we conclude that the trial court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion in impliedly finding that appellant was not\r\narrested at the time of the initial stop. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did\r\nappellant=s detention rise to an illegal\r\narrest when the police officer conducted a pat-down?\r\n\r\nAppellant further contends that even if the arrest was not\r\nmandatory, a reasonable person would have believed he was under arrest when\r\nOfficer Krutsinger conducted his pat-down.\u00a0 A police officer may lawfully stop\r\nand detain a person for a traffic violation.\u00a0 See Garcia v. State, 827\r\nS.W.2d 937, 944 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).\u00a0 During the detention, the officer may\r\nrequest information concerning the driver=s license,\r\nownership of the vehicle, the driver=s insurance\r\ninformation, the driver=s destination, and the purpose of the\r\ntrip. Mohmed v. State, 977 S.W.2d 624, 628 (Tex. App.CFort Worth 1998,\r\npet. ref=d).\u00a0 An officer\r\nalso may conduct a warrant check to determine whether the driver has any\r\noutstanding warrants, conduct a pat down search of the driver for weapons, and\r\nrequest the driver=s consent to search his vehicle.\u00a0 Smith\r\nv. State, 840 S.W.2d 689, 692 (Tex. App.CFort Worth 1992,\r\npet. ref=d).\u00a0 A person held\r\nfor investigative detention is not in custody.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIf, during a valid traffic stop and detention, the officer\r\ndevelops reasonable suspicion that the detainee is engaged in criminal\r\nactivity, then prolonged or continued detention is justified.\u00a0 See Davis v.\r\nState, 947 S.W.2d 240, 244 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).\u00a0 The determination of\r\nwhether one is in custody is based entirely upon objective circumstances, not\r\nsubjective belief.\u00a0\u00a0 State v.

Moore, 25 S.W.3d 383, 386 (Tex.

Ct. 3128, 3141, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317\r\n(1984) (stating that at most, the accident investigation may have escalated\r\nfrom a consensual encounter to an investigative detention, but the mere focus\r\nupon the defendant did not convert the investigation into an arrest).\u00a0 When\r\nOfficer Krutsinger was patting down appellant, he felt an object, and asked\r\nappellant what it was.\u00a0 Officer Krutsinger then reached into the pocket and\r\nremoved a lighter.[3]\u00a0\r\nOfficer Krutsinger testified that he typically pats down a suspect for his own\r\nsafety concerns.[4]\u00a0\r\nEven assuming that Officer Krutsinger possessed probable cause to arrest, the\r\nexistence of probable cause does not establish custody.\u00a0 See Stevenson,\r\n958 S.W.2d at 829 n.7.\u00a0 An officer=s knowledge of\r\nprobable cause must be manifested to the suspect.\u00a0 Id. \u00a0Moreover, detention\r\nfor investigatory purposes does not establish custody.\u00a0 Id. at 829 (the\r\nmere fact a defendant becomes the focus of a criminal investigation does not\r\nconvert the investigation into an arrest).\u00a0 Furthermore, there is no evidence\r\nin the record that Officer Krutsinger manifested to appellant any intent to\r\narrest until appellant was formally arrested.\u00a0 See Stevenson, 958\r\nS.W.2d at 829 (stating that detention for investigatory purposes does not\r\nestablish custody).\u00a0 An objective analysis of the totality of the circumstances\r\ndemonstrates that Officer Krutsinger=s search and\r\nseizure of appellant was a temporary investigative detention.\u00a0 Officer\r\nKrutsinger had specific articulable facts which warranted a temporary\r\ndetention.\u00a0 The initial seizure in this case is a classic example of a valid\r\ntemporary investigative detention.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, we conclude that, under the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, the pat-down was part of this investigation and did not exceed\r\nthe permissible scope of Terry.\u00a0 See Lemons v.

State, 8 S.W.3d 354, 361 (Tex. App.CAmarillo 1999, no\r\npet.) (finding statement by defendant that she was Anot talking@ and was going to\r\nshut up, as well as, AI have to get [a lawyer] for both of us@ when told she\r\ncould talk to lawyer was an unambiguous invocation of the right to remain\r\nsilent and to counsel).\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the video made at the station\r\ndemonstrates that, during the interview, he clearly and unequivocally exercised\r\nhis right to remain silent simply by refusing to answer the officer.\u00a0 We\r\ndisagree.\u00a0 After viewing the videotape, we conclude that appellant did not (1)\r\nmake a clear invocation of his right to be silent during this interview or (2)\r\nexpress a clear desire to terminate the interview.\u00a0 Indeed, although appellant\r\nwas belligerent and appeared to be intoxicated, he answered most, if not all,\r\nof the questions posed by the officer.\u00a0 For instance, when Officer HellmanCthe officer who\r\nadministered the tests at the stationCasked appellant to\r\nperform a certain test, appellant would stand silent for moments at a time, but\r\nhe never told the officer in unequivocal terms that he wanted to remain silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Appellant did not invoke his right to be silent until the\r\nconclusion of the video when he was read his rights.\u00a0 At that point, appellant\r\nwas asked if he understood his rights and if he wished to waive his rights.\u00a0\r\nAfter a significant pause, appellant responded, ANo,@ and all\r\nquestioning ceased.\u00a0 Prior to that, appellant=s silence with\r\nrespect to some questions while continuing to respond to others throughout the\r\nvideo did not constitute an unambiguous and unequivocal invocation of his right\r\nto remain silent. \u00a0See Anderson v.

Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not err in impliedly finding that: (1)\r\nthe stop of appellant=s vehicle was supported by reasonable\r\nsuspicion based on dispatch information regarding a red truck (similar to the\r\none driven by appellant) hitting another vehicle and fleeing the scene; (2)\r\nappellant was not under arrest at the time of the initial stop; (3) appellant\r\nwas legally detained based on reasonable suspicion; (4) the search of appellant=s pocket did not\r\nescalate appellant=s legal detention to an illegal arrest\r\nwithout a warrant or probable cause; and (5) appellant did not invoke his right\r\nto remain silent at the station by refusing to answer some questions, because Ain order to invoke\r\nthe right to remain silent, a person must do more than just remain silent,@ and appellant=s invocation of\r\nhis right to remain silent did not occur until the end of the station video\r\nwhenCafter being read\r\nhis rightsCappellant responded that he did not wish to waive any\r\nof his rights.\u00a0 The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\r\nmotion to suppress.\u00a0 Accordingly, appellant=s sole issue on\r\nappeal is overruled and the trial court=s judgment is\r\naffirmed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n/s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kem Thompson Frost\r\n\r\nJustice\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJudgment rendered\r\nand Opinion filed October 18, 2007.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPanel consists of\r\nJustices Anderson, Frost, and Mirabal.*\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish C Tex.
