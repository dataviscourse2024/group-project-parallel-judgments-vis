Bressler's husband, David Ulane, activated\n\nan Apple security feature through the iCloud that locked the laptop to prevent its use\n\nwithout an additional pin code. The security feature also sent Bressler an e-mail showing\n\fNo. 33645-0-111\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\nthe laptop's location if the current possessor turned on the computer in the area of a Wi-\n\nFi network.\n\n       On January 21, Janet Bressler received an e-mail from Apple notifying her of the\n\nlaptop's location at 2322 North Haven Street in Spokane. Bressler and Ulane researched\n\nthe address on another computer and found the address to be an apartment complex. The\n\ntwo forwarded information about the stolen laptop to police.\n\n       On January 23, Jill Fleck brought the laptop to Strong Solutions, a computer repair\n\nstore. Fleck told Strong Solutions that her daughter locked the laptop's password. As\n\nproof of purchase for determination of warranty information, Fleck provided the store\n\nwith an August 12, 2013, Best Buy receipt for the purchase of a MacBook Pro laptop\n\ncomputer for $1,134.99. The receipt did not match the computer. Strong Solutions\n\ndetermined the laptop was remotely locked, not mistakenly locked by the daughter.\n\n       On January 23, Janet Bressler received another e-mail from Apple showing her\n\nlaptop's location to be Strong Solutions. On January 24, David Ulane called Strong\n\nSolutions, confirmed that the store possessed the laptop, and informed the store that the\n\nlaptop was stolen. Ulane informed the police of the new location of the laptop. On\n\nJanuary 24, Spokane police officers journeyed to Strong Solutions, took the laptop,\n\nrecorded the laptop as police evidence, and returned it to Janet Bressler.\n\n       On January 27, at law enforcement's request, Strong Solutions telephoned Jill\n\nFleck to encourage her to retrieve the laptop from the store premises. Fleck returned to\n\n                                             2\n\fNo. 33645-0-III\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\nStrong Solutions, where Spokane Police Detective Stacey Carr asked her questions about\n\nthe laptop. Fleck claimed she purchased the laptop from her neighbor for $500 cash.\n\nDetective Carr never examined the laptop.\n\n                                         PROCEDURE\n\n         On September 3, 2014, the State of Washington charged Jill Fleck with one count\n\nof possession of stolen property in the second degree. Conviction of the crime requires\n\nevidence that the stolen property's value exceeds $750 and does not exceed $5,000. A\n\nkey issue at trial was the value of the MacBook Air laptop computer at the time of its\n\ntheft.\n\n         During trial, laptop owner Janet Bressler testified:\n\n                 Q Is it fair to say you've had that computer for some time before\n         this incident?\n                 A Well, depending on what you mean by some time, but-\n                 Q Like, for more than a year?\n                 A Yes.\n                 Q Okay. So was it-it was a used computer-\n                 A Yeah.\n                 Q -at that point? Okay. And is it fair to say you don't know the\n         exact value of the computer?\n                 A I do not, no.\n\nReport of Proceedings (RP) at 23.\n\n         During trial, Detective Stacey Carr testified:\n\n               Q All right. In the course of your investigation were you able to\n         determine the value of the stolen computer?\n               A Yes.\n               Q And what is that value-or, what was that value in 2014?\n\n                                                3\n\fNo. 33645-0-111\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\n             A When I researched it, I believe it was between [$]800 and $1,500\n       depending on which site I went through, eBay, Craigslist, some Apple\n       websites.\n\nRP at 51. Jill Fleck's trial counsel did not object to Carr's testimony concerning the\n\nvalue of the computer.\n\n       During its closing argument, the State said:\n\n             We also know, secondly, that the computer was worth between $800\n       and $1,500 because Detective Carr investigated that by calling for fair\n       mark[et] value. She checked Craigslist. She checked eBay. And, most\n       importantly, she checked the Apple site, which gives up-to-date\n       information on used computers as to what the price would be.\n\nRP at 127.\n\n       The trial court instructed the jury on the crime of possession of stolen property in\n\nthe second degree. The trial court did not instruct on possession of stolen property in the\n\nthird degree as a lesser included offense. The jury found Jill Fleck guilty.\n\n                                 LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\n       On appeal, Jill Fleck challenges the sufficiency of evidence and her attorney's\n\nperformance in failing to object to Detective Stacey Carr's testimony concerning the\n\nvalue of the stolen laptop computer. Ifwe agreed that the jury heard insufficient\n\nevidence to convict, we would dismiss the charge rather than remand for a new trial.\n\nTherefore, we address the sufficiency of evidence first.\n\n                                 Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n       Jill Fleck contends the State of Washington failed to prove the value of the stolen\n\n                                             4\n\fNo. 33645-0-111\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\nproperty exceeded $750 as required for second degree possession of stolen property. She\n\nrequests that this court reverse her conviction and remand for the trial court to enter\n\njudgment on the lesser included offense of possessing stolen property in the third degree.\n\nThe State responds that sufficient evidence supported the conviction because the value of\n\nApple computers is within the ordinary experience and knowledge of the jury, Detective\n\nStacey Carr testified that the laptop was valued between $800 and $1,500, and Fleck told\n\nDetective Carr she purchased the laptop for $500. Because of Detective Carr's\n\ntestimony, we agree with the State that sufficient evidence supports the conviction.\n\n       Evidence is sufficient if a rational trier of fact could find each element of the crime\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Green, 94 Wn.2d 216, 221-22, 616 P.2d 628 (1980).\n\nBoth direct and indirect evidence may support the jury's verdict. State v. Brooks, 45 Wn.\n\nApp. 824, 826, 727 P.2d 988 (1986). This court draws all reasonable inferences in favor\n\nof the State. State v. Partin, 88 Wn.2d 899, 906-07, 567 P.2d 1136 (1977). Only the trier\n\nof fact weighs the evidence and judges the credibility of witnesses. State v. Carver, 113\n\nWn.2d 591, 604, 781 P.2d 1308, 789 P.2d 306 (1989).\n\n       \"A person is guilty of possessing stolen property in the second degree if: (a) He or\n\nshe possesses stolen property, other than a firearm as defined in RCW 9.41.010 or a\n\nmotor vehicle, which exceeds seven hundred fifty dollars in value but does not exceed\n\nfive thousand dollars in value.\" RCW 9A.56.160. '\"Value' means the market value of\n\nthe property or services at the time and in the approximate area of the criminal act.\"\n\n                                              5\n\fNo. 33645-0-111\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\nRCW 9A.56.010(21 ). Market value is the price a well-informed buyer would pay to a\n\nwell-informed seller when neither party is obliged to enter the transaction. State v. Kleist,\n\n126 Wn.2d 432,435, 895 P.2d 398 (1995). Direct evidence is not necessary to prove\n\nvalue, rather a jury may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, including changes\n\nin the condition of the property that affect its value. State v. Ehrhardt, 167 Wn. App.\n\n934, 944, 276 P.3d 332 (2012).\n\n       Jill Fleck objects to the testimony of Detective Stacey Carr on the basis of hearsay.\n\nNevertheless, in reviewing for sufficiency of evidence, the court does not ignore evidence\n\nerroneously admitted at trial or evidence which could have been excluded as, for\n\nexample, inadmissible hearsay. State v. Hamdan, 13-0113 (La. Ct. App. 4th Cir.\n\n12/11/13) 131 So. 3d 197, 203, writ denied, 140 So. 3d 1188 (La. 2014); State v. Castillo-\n\nSanchez, 1999-NMCA-085, 127 N.M. 540,984 P.2d 787, 795; State v. Knuckles, 196 W.\n\nVa. 416,473 S.E.2d 131, 140 (1996); People v. Bailey, 1 Cal. Ct. App. 4th 459, 463, 2\n\nCal. Rptr. 2d 204 (1991). Carr's testimony sufficiently established the value of the stolen\n\ngoods to be at least $750.\n\n                              Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n                                         Deficiency\n\n       Jill Fleck contends she received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial when her\n\ncounsel failed to object to Detective Stacey Carr's hearsay testimony of the value of the\n\nlaptop. The State responds that Fleck's attorney was not ineffective because Carr's\n\n                                             6\n\fNo. 33645-0-III\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\ntestimony was permissible hearsay. We agree with Fleck.\n\n       To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must show\n\nhis attorney was not functioning as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); State v.\n\nThiefault, 160 Wn.2d 409,414, 158 P.3d 580 (2007). A claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel requires a showing that (1) counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant. State v. Thomas, 109 Wn.2d 222, 225-\n\n26, 743 P.2d 816 (1987). We presume that counsel was effective. Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. at 689; State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322,335, 899 P.2d 1251\n\n(1995).\n\n       Deficient performance occurs when trial counsel's performance falls below an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness. State v. Stenson, 132 Wn.2d 668, 705, 940 P.2d\n\n1239 (1997). The defendant bears the burden to show deficient performance. State v.\n\nGrier, 171 Wn.2d 17, 33, 246 P .3d 1260 (2011 ). To rebut a strong presumption that\n\ncounsel's performance was effective, the defendant must establish the absence of any\n\nconceivable legitimate tactic explaining counsel's failure to object to testimony. State v.\n\nHamilton, 179 Wn. App. 870, 879-80, 320 P.3d 142 (2014). When counsel's alleged\n\nerror is failure to object to evidence, the defendant must also show that the trial court\n\nwould have sustained an objection. State v. Saunders, 91 Wn. App. 575, 578, 958 P.2d\n\n364 (1998).\n\n                                              7\n\fNo. 33645-0-111\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\n       Jill Fleck claims that Detective Stacey Carr's testimony on the value of the laptop\n\nwas inadmissible hearsay and no conceivable strategic reason existed for her counsel's\n\nfailure to object to the testimony. Fleck emphasizes that Carr's hearsay testimony\n\ncomprised the entirety of the State's evidence of the value element of the crime and thus\n\ncounsel's failure to object effectively conceded an element that the State needed to prove.\n\nThe State of Washington responds that counsel was not deficient because Detective\n\nCarr's testimony fell within the market reports exception to hearsay. The State does not\n\nforward any reason why trial counsel legitimately failed to object to the testimony,\n\nassuming the market report exception did not apply.\n\n       Hearsay is a statement made outside of trial or a hearing that is offered in evidence\n\nto prove the truth of the matter asserted. ER 801(c). Hearsay is inadmissible unless a\n\nhearsay exception applies. ER 802. The market reports exception to hearsay applies to:\n\n              Market Reports, Commercial Publications. Market quotations,\n       tabulations, lists, directories, or other published compilations, generally\n       used and relied upon by the public or by persons in particular occupations.\n\nER 803(a)(l 7).\n\n       Detective Stacey Carr's testimony of the value of the laptop being between $800\n\nand $1,500 constituted hearsay. Carr relied on out of court statements she read on eBay,\n\nCraigslist, and some Apple websites. Since the State introduced the evidence to prove\n\nthe value of the stolen laptop, the State sought to use the testimony to establish the truth\n                                                                                               l\nof the extrajudicial statements.                                                               f\n                                              8\n\fNo. 33645-0-III\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\n       We rule that the market reports exception to hearsay did not apply because the\n\nState presented no evidence that the websites entered by Detective Stacey Carr were\n\npublications on which the public relied when purchasing a used Macbook Air laptop.\n\nThe State relies on State v. Shaw, 120 Wn. App. 847, 86 P.3d 823 (2004) to support the\n\nmarket report exception. In Shaw, the State charged Jeremy Shaw with possession of\n\nstolen property in the first degree for his possession of a stolen vehicle. The State needed\n\nto prove the vehicle's value exceeded $1,500. At trial, the investigating detective\n\ntestified that he used the Kelly Blue Book Internet site to research the vehicle's value.\n\nThe detective described the methodology employed by Kelly Blue Book to value a\n\nvehicle and mentioned that the site provided two values for vehicles, retail value\u00b7 and\n\nprivate party value. This court affirmed the admission of testimony finding the Kelley\n\nBlue Book site admissible as a market report under ER 803(a)(l 7). We reasoned that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse it discretion in admitting the evidence because:\n\n              As the foundation laid by the detective's testimony showed, it is a\n       publication used to determine what a person might expect to pay when buying .a\n       used car, or to receive when selling one. Other jurisdictions have recognized the\n       Blue Book as a standard and reliable reference for valuation of vehicles.\n\nShaw, 120 Wn. App. at 852.\n\n       Important differences distinguish this appeal from State v. Shaw. Detective Stacey\n\nCarr provided no foundation for the public's use of Craigslist, eBay, and the various\n\nApple websites for determining value. Carr did not describe the methodology she used\n\n\n                                             9\n                                                                                               I\n                                                                                               J\n\n                                                                                               l\n\fNo. 33645-0-111\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\nwhen researching the laptop's value or the data required by any of the websites for\n\ndetermining value. Kelley Blue Book is designed to provide reliable valuation\n\ninformation. The websites viewed by Carr facilitate the purchase or sale of items and\n\nmay reflect a high asking price.\n\n       Jill Fleck's trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to raise a hearsay\n\nobjection to Detective Stacey Carr's valuation testimony because the evidence was\n\ninadmissible and there is no strategic reason to allow the State to prove an element of the\n\ncrime solely through inadmissible evidence.\n\n                                         Prejudice\n\n       Prejudice occurs, for purposes of ineffective assistance of counsel, when the\n\noutcome would have differed with effective assistance. In re Pers. Restraint of Pirtle,\n\n136 Wn.2d 467, 487, 965 P.2d 593 (1998); State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d at 337\n\n(1995). We hold that Jill Fleck shows prejudice because she likely would have avoided\n\nconviction upon an objection to the valuation evidence.\n\n       The jury relied on nominal evidence when determining the value of the laptop\n\nexceeded $750. The evidence included testimony as to the computer's year of purchase,\n\nits used nature, Jill Fleck's probably false assertion that she purchased the laptop for\n\n$500, and Detective Stacey Carr's valuation testimony. During closing argument, the\n\nState proffered only Stacey Carr's testimony to support the value element of the crime.\n\nWithout Carr's valuation testimony, the jury heard no evidence to sustain a finding of a\n\n                                             10\n\f)\n\n\nI\nI   No. 33645-0-III\n    State v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\n    value exceeding $750.\n\n                            Statement of Additional Grounds for Review\n\n           A criminal defendant may submit a pro se statement of additional grounds for\n\n    review \"to identify and discuss those matters related to the decision under review that the\n\n    defendant believes have not been adequately addressed by the brief filed by the\n\n    defendant's counsel.\" RAP 10.lO(a). Jill Fleck raises two additional grounds for review.\n\n                                          Due Process\n\n           In her first additional ground, Jill Fleck contends in a lengthy sentence:\n\n                   Finding me guilty of a gross misdemeanor violates my due process\n           rights besides a gross misdemeanor can not be prosecuted after 2 years of\n           its commission according to RCW 9A.04.080 finding me guilty of this\n           crime without a trial in the appropriate court would be a violation of due\n           process my right to be tried in the proper court would be ignored finding\n           me guilty of a crime [without] a trial is a miscarriage of Justice.\n\n    Statement of additional grounds for review at 1. Fleck's first challenge may be to a\n\n    purported conviction for a gross misdemeanor on the ground of the statute of limitations.\n\n    We reject this challenge.\n\n           Second degree possession of stolen property is a class C felony, with a statute of\n\n    limitations of three years. RCW 9A.04.080(h). The theft of the laptop computer\n\n    occurred on January 20, 2014, and the State charged Jill Fleck by information on\n\n    September 3, 2014. Thus, the State did not violate the statute of limitations.\n\n                                Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\n                                                  11                                              l\n                                                                                                  I\n\fNo. 33645-0-111\nState v. Ferguson aka Fleck\n\n\n       In her second additional ground, Jill Fleck alleges:\n\n              The fact that my Public Defender was ineffective is grounds enough\n       for dismissal. A public records request was made by Reporter Anne Block\n       in June 2015 & it was not fulfilled by the P.D. office. This implies\n       misconduct & Ms. Block intends on filing suit regarding this request so do I\n       especially after the conduct from several court employees that occurred.\n       See attached emails evidence of [ex parte] communication and retaliation\n       which is brazen & offensive!\n\nStatement of additional grounds for review at 1. We reject this claim because the\n\nassertion lacks relevance to her criminal trial. The claim apparently concerns an alleged\n\nfailure by counsel to respond to a public records act request after her conviction.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n       We reverse Jill Fleck's conviction and remand for a new trial.\n\n       A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW\n\n2.06.040.\n                                                                                            I\n                                                                                            t\n\n                                              Fearing,\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                                              Pennell, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n                                                                                            I\n\f",
