FILED MARCH 21, 2016\n\n      Appellant, Charles Matthew Shaffer, appeals from the order dismissing\n\nhis petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d) without a\n\nhearing. Shaffer raises twelve issues based upon his claims that his trial\n\ncounsel was ineffective. After careful review, we conclude that none of\n\nShaffer\u2019s claims have merit, and therefore affirm.\n\n      A jury convicted Shaffer of attempted rape, attempted involuntary\n\ndeviate sexual intercourse, and indecent assault, based upon allegations that\n\nhe had attempted to forcibly rape an ex-girlfriend in his home. On November\n\n14, 2013, the trial court sentenced Shaffer to an aggregate term of\n\nimprisonment of 10 to 20 years. Shaffer did not file post-sentence motions\n\nor a direct appeal.\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\n       On November 6, 2014, Shaffer filed a pro se PCRA petition. Counsel\n\nwas appointed to represent him,1 and counsel filed an amended petition. The\n\nPCRA court subsequently entered a notice of its intent to dismiss the\n\namended petition without a hearing. Shaffer filed a counseled response,\n\nhowever the PCRA court entered an order dismissing his petition without a\n\nhearing on June 5, 2015. This timely appeal followed.\n\n       On appeal, Shaffer contends that the PCRA court committed twelve\n\nseparate errors when it concluded that trial counsel was not ineffective\n\nwithout a hearing. These twelve allegations of error are grouped into six\n\nseparate argument sections. We will address the issues as Shaffer has\n\nchosen to organize them in his argument.\n\n       \u201cOn appeal from the denial of PCRA relief, our standard and scope of\n\nreview is limited to determining whether the PCRA court\u2019s findings are\n\nsupported by the record and without legal error.\u201d       Commonwealth v.\n\nEdmiston, 65 A.3d 339, 345 (Pa. 2013) (citation omitted), cert. denied,\n\nEdmiston v. Pennsylvania, 134 S. Ct. 639 (2013). \u201c[Our] scope of review\n\nis limited to the findings of the PCRA court and the evidence of record,\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n The certified record is not clear regarding when counsel was appointed. An\norder dated November 14, 2014, setting a PCRA conference date for\nDecember 11, 2014, is copied to Shaffer, but left blank the section for\nappointment of counsel. On December 12, 2014, the trial court entered an\norder directing Shaffer to file an amended petition within 30 days that is\ncopied to counsel. Shaffer subsequently filed a pro se amended petition,\nwhich was followed by a counseled amended petition, and several\nsubsequent amendments to append exhibits to the petition.\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at the PCRA court\n\nlevel.\u201d Commonwealth v. Koehler, 36 A.3d 121, 131 (Pa. 2012) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n      \u201c[T]his Court applies a de novo standard of review to the PCRA court\u2019s\n\nlegal conclusions.\u201d Commonwealth v. Spotz, 18 A.3d 244, 259 (Pa. 2011)\n\n(citation omitted). In order to be eligible for PCRA relief, a petitioner must\n\nplead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his conviction or\n\nsentence arose from one or more of the errors listed at 42 Pa.C.S.A.\n\n\u00a7 9543(a)(2). These issues must be neither previously litigated nor waived.\n\nSee 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9543(a)(3).\n\n      It is well settled that\n\n      [t]o plead and prove ineffective assistance of counsel a\n      petitioner must establish: (1) that the underlying issue has\n      arguable merit; (2) counsel\u2019s actions lacked an objective\n      reasonable basis; and (3) actual prejudice resulted from\n      counsel's act or failure to act.\n\nCommonwealth v. Rykard, 55 A.3d 1177, 1189-1190 (Pa. Super. 2012),\n\nappeal denied, 64 A.3d 631 (Pa. 2013) (citation omitted). \u201cGenerally, where\n\nmatters of strategy and tactics are concerned, counsel\u2019s assistance is\n\ndeemed constitutionally effective if he chose a particular course that had\n\nsome reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Colavita, 993 A.2d 874, 887 (Pa. 2010) (citation\n\nomitted). A failure to satisfy any prong of the test will require rejection of\n\nthe claim. See Commonwealth v. Spotz, 84 A.3d 294, 311 (Pa. 2014).\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\n      The right to an evidentiary hearing on a post-conviction petition is not\n\nabsolute. See Commonwealth v. Jordan, 772 A.2d 1011, 1014 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2001). It is within the PCRA court\u2019s discretion to decline to hold a\n\nhearing if the petitioner\u2019s claim is patently frivolous and has no support\n\neither in the record or other evidence. See id. It is the responsibility of the\n\nreviewing court on appeal to examine each issue raised in the PCRA petition\n\nin light of the record certified before it in order to determine if the PCRA\n\ncourt erred in its determination that there were no genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact in controversy and in denying relief without conducting an\n\nevidentiary hearing. See Commonwealth v. Hardcastle, 701 A.2d 541,\n\n542-543 (Pa. 1997).     In \u201cineffectiveness claims in particular, if the record\n\nreflects that the underlying issue is of no arguable merit or no prejudice\n\nresulted,   no   evidentiary   hearing   is   required.\u201d   Commonwealth      v.\n\nBauhammers, 92 A.3d 708, 726-727 (Pa. 2014) (citation omitted).\n\n\u201cPrejudice is established if there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A\n\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\n\nthe outcome.\u201d Commonwealth v. Stewart, 84 A.3d 701, 707 (Pa. Super.\n\n2013) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We review a PCRA\n\ncourt\u2019s decision to deny a claim without a hearing for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee id.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\n      Shaffer\u2019s first category of argument concerns trial counsel\u2019s actions\n\nregarding the victim\u2019s mental health. Shaffer argues that trial counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to question the victim about her mental health and for\n\nfailing to retain an expert to opine on the issue of the victim\u2019s mental health.\n\nInitially, we note that, outside of his own allegations, Shaffer has failed to\n\nestablish   that   the   victim   suffered   from   any   mental   health   issues.\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence of record, through expert opinion or\n\notherwise, establishing the relevance of the victim\u2019s mental health to the\n\nissues at trial. We therefore conclude that Shaffer has failed to establish that\n\nthis claim has arguable merit, and therefore the PCRA court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in dismissing these claims without a hearing.\n\n      Next, Shaffer contends that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to\n\ncommunicate with him prior to trial. In particular, he contends that if trial\n\ncounsel had communicated with him, trial counsel would have been aware of\n\nissues raised during a protection from abuse (\u201cPFA\u201d) hearing between\n\nShaffer and the victim. There is no transcript of this PFA hearing, nor any\n\nreference to it at all outside of Shaffer\u2019s allegations, in the certified record.\n\nAs such, Shaffer has failed to establish any arguable merit to the claim that\n\nthe PFA hearings were relevant to the criminal charges against him. We\n\ntherefore conclude that the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion, and\n\nShaffer is due no relief on this argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\n      In his third category of allegations, Shaffer complains that trial counsel\n\nconvinced him not to testify at trial as she advised him that his prior\n\nconvictions could be used against him if he did. Shaffer now contends that\n\nthis advice was incorrect. After reviewing the certification of PCRA counsel\n\nattached as an exhibit to the amended petition, we disagree.\n\n      Generally, certain crimes involving dishonesty or false statement,\n\nwhether the result of a guilty verdict, plea, or nolo contendere, may be\n\nadmitted for the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness. See\n\nPa.R.E. 609(a). However, when the conviction is more than ten years old, it\n\nis admissible only after a determination by the trial court that the probative\n\nvalue of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. See\n\nPa.R.E. 609(b).\n\n      Here, counsel\u2019s certification indicated an unknown disposition for theft\n\nin 2003, an unknown disposition for burglary in 2003, and an unknown\n\ndisposition for vehicle theft in 2006. Shaffer argues that it was the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s burden to establish the disposition of these charges. While\n\nthis may have been true at trial, in collateral proceedings under the PCRA, it\n\nis the petitioner\u2019s burden to establish his claims. Since the certification does\n\nnot establish that these convictions would have been inadmissible at trial,\n\nShaffer has failed to meet his burden to establish arguable merit. We\n\ntherefore conclude that the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndismissing this claim without a hearing.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\n      Next, Shaffer raises four arguments based upon his belief that trial\n\ncounsel did not adequately cross-examine the victim. First, he reiterates his\n\ncomplaints about the PFA hearing. As before, this argument fails due to the\n\nfact that the transcript has not been made part of the record. Second, he\n\nargues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to question the victim\n\nregarding her testimony at the preliminary hearing. This transcript is not in\n\nthe certified record either, and therefore this argument fails as well.\n\nShaffer\u2019s third argument in this category is that trial counsel should have\n\nquestioned the victim about her delay in filing a PFA petition. Once again,\n\nShaffer has failed to produce any document, other than his own allegations,\n\nregarding the PFA proceeding, let alone that there was any delay in the\n\ninitiation of such proceedings. Thus, this claim also fails. In his fourth claim\n\nin this category, Shaffer argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to\n\nquestion the victim about the lack of bruises or marks on her body after the\n\nincident. Returning to a common theme, there is no indication in the record,\n\nother than Shaffer\u2019s allegations, about the victim\u2019s injuries or lack thereof.\n\nWithout some indication that there was objective evidence of the victim\u2019s\n\nstatus after the incident, the PCRA court correctly ruled that Shaffer had\n\nfailed to raise a triable issue. Shaffer\u2019s fourth category of alleged errors\n\ntherefore merits no relief.\n\n      In his fifth argument, Shaffer alleges that trial counsel had a personal\n\nanimosity towards him. He thus contends that his allegations of trial counsel\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\nerror, when combined with this personal animus, constitute abandonment by\n\ncounsel. However, we have already concluded that Shaffer failed to meet his\n\nthreshold burden of establishing arguable merit in his allegations of trial\n\ncounsel ineffectiveness. As such, Shaffer cannot establish that the presence\n\nof any personal animosity between Shaffer and trial counsel led to any\n\nprejudice. We therefore conclude that the PCRA court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in dismissing this claim.\n\n      In his sixth and final category of alleged error, Shaffer claims that trial\n\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to call witnesses that Shaffer desired to\n\nhave testify at trial. Trial counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to\n\ncall a witness to testify unless it is demonstrated that\n\n      (1) the witness existed; (2) the witness was available; (3)\n      counsel knew of, or should have known of the existence of the\n      witness; (4) the witness was willing to testify for the defense;\n      and (5) the absence of the testimony was so prejudicial to\n      petitioner to have denied him or her a fair trial.\n\nCommonwealth v. Brown, 18 A.3d 1147, 1160-1161 (Pa. Super. 2011)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n      Herein, Shaffer does not establish the identity of any witnesses, their\n\navailability at the time of trial, or the substance of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\n\nWithout this necessary evidence we are unable to conclude that the absence\n\nof the testimony was so prejudicial to petitioner to have denied him a fair\n\ntrial. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the PCRA court abused its\n\ndiscretion in dismissing this claim without a hearing.\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fJ-S09009-16\n\n\n\n     As we conclude that none of Shaffer\u2019s claims on appeal merit relief, we\n\naffirm the order dismissing his PCRA petition without a hearing.\n\n     Order affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 3/21/2016\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",
