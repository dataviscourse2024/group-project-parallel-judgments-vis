(2)  The jury found appellant guilty, and the trial court\r\nassessed punishment at 30 years' confinement.  We affirm. Facts\r\n\r\n\tThe Charged Offense\r\n\r\n\tNelle Patton is a 71-year-old woman who lives alone and enjoys playing tennis\r\nthree to five times a week.  She had been harassed by constant doorbell rings and\r\nknocks at her door with no one there when she answered.  She had assumed that it\r\nwas teenagers. \r\n\r\n\tOn December 4, 1999, an intruder rang  Patton's doorbell \"insistently\" until\r\nshe left her bedroom to answer the door.  As she was walking down the hallway near\r\nthe living room in her home, she ran into appellant.  Patton described appellant as\r\nbeing a black man with little or no hair and gold rimmed glasses.\r\n\r\n\tPatton asked who appellant was, how he had gotten into the home, and what\r\nhe wanted.  Appellant replied that he wanted \"a little p****.\"  Patton tried to distract\r\nappellant from achieving his ultimate goal by laughing at his comment, asking him\r\nquestions, and trying to make small talk.  Patton backed herself against the wall in the\r\nhallway in order to protect herself.  She realized that appellant had one of her knives\r\nand was covering it with a white cloth.  After she told him that the knife frightened\r\nher, he dropped it.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant began to grope Patton, including her breasts.  Appellant penetrated\r\nPatton's vagina with his fingers and said he would not hurt her.   She told him that he\r\nwas hurting her and he eventually stopped.  Appellant got down on his knees and was\r\ngoing to attempt oral sex, when Patton laughed and told him that her legs were too\r\nlong for him to do that.  Appellant than grabbed Patton's hand and made her hold his\r\npenis.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant began to realize that dawn was approaching.  He walked into her\r\nbedroom and asked Patton if she wanted him to leave.  She told him that she did. \r\nAppellant said that he would leave through the front door if she would go into her\r\nbedroom and lock the door.  Patton, in fear of being raped and killed if she did that,\r\nrefused and said that she would go into the bedroom if he would go into the living\r\nroom.  Appellant went to the living room and Patton ran to her bedroom and dead-bolted the door.  She tried to call the police, but she could not because the telephone\r\nlines had been cut.  She grabbed her gun from the dresser and tried to shoot it.  The\r\ngun fired and went through her television, lodging the bullet in her dresser.  She heard\r\nappellant move and thought that he had left, so she went to her bathroom and tried to\r\nclimb out the window.  She could not fit, and in attempting to get out, she laid the gun\r\non the window sill and it fired again, hitting the neighbor's garage.  Patton then ran\r\nto another bedroom and escaped through a window.  She yelled for her neighbor, who\r\ncalled 911.\r\n\r\n\tOfficer Edward Srebalus arrived at Patton's home.  He observed a broken\r\nwindow pane in the breakfast area near the back door.  He attempted to recover\r\nfingerprints at the points of entry and exit, but was unsuccessful.  A few weeks after\r\nthe attack, Patton sat down with a sketch artist and produced a sketch of the intruder\r\nthat closely resembled appellant.\r\n\r\n\tThe Extraneous Offense at the Guilt/Innocense Phase\r\n\r\n\tGeorgia Garrett is a 70-year-old woman who lives alone in an apartment.  In\r\nthe beginning of 2000, Garrett saw the shadow of someone stooping outside her patio\r\nwindow.  The person ran away, and she called the police.  About one month later,\r\nGarrett saw a shadow again, and she again called the police. Garrett stated that both\r\ntimes the individual was appellant.  Garrett asked the apartment complex to install a\r\npatio light, but someone kept jumping over the fence enclosing her patio and\r\nunscrewing the light bulb and also shining a flashlight into her bedroom window.  On\r\nanother occasion, someone left pornographic pictures titled \"Promiscuous Granny\"\r\nat Garrett's apartment door.\r\n\r\n\tOn November 6, 2000, officers were called to Garrett's apartment complex to\r\ninvestigate an unrelated disturbance.  They had been called to the complex numerous\r\ntimes because of reports of a \"peeping tom.\"  While the officers were at the apartment\r\ncomplex, Garrett called the police because someone was in her patio.  A dispatcher\r\ntold the officers that a black man had been seen in one of the apartment's patios. \r\nOfficer Steven May approached Garrett's apartment and saw a man standing near the\r\nwindow in the patio.  The other officer went into Garrett's apartment and walked\r\nthrough the sliding glass door onto the patio to handcuff appellant.  Appellant had a\r\nflashlight and a tool that could be used to open a sliding glass door. \r\n\r\n\tAppellant was arrested for this offense.  While in custody he consented to\r\nbeing placed in a line-up.  Patton was unable to make a positive identification. \r\n\r\n\tThe Confession\r\n\r\n\tAppellant made an oral confession that was audio-taped on November 6, 2000,\r\nand was played to the jury over a renewed objection.  Appellant does not contest the\r\nadmissibility of the confession on appeal.  In the confession, appellant admits  to his\r\ninterest in older women and to looking into other people's homes because he was\r\nattracted to the light coming from the windows.  He states that he was face-to-face\r\nwith only one woman around a year before the confession, i.e., around the time of the\r\noffense with which he was charged. Appellant admits that he entered the woman's\r\nhome through a door, either the garage or the kitchen door, which he claims was\r\nopen, but that he was not let into the woman's home by the woman; that he then rang\r\nher door bell; that when she answered the bell, he fondled her breasts and rubbed her\r\nlegs near or in her living room where she was standing; and that her legs interested\r\nhim the most.  The woman told him what he was doing was wrong, told him that he\r\nlooked like a nice person that would not do something like this, asked him why he\r\nwas doing what he was doing, and said to him, \"God bless [you].\"  He left after the\r\nwoman asked him to leave; and the woman told him she would pray for him. \r\nAppellant identified the woman as someone who plays tennis and described her as\r\nCaucasian, in her fifties or sixties.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant stated that the night he was in Garrett's patio, he left his apartment\r\naround 1:30 a.m.  Appellant also explained why he was in Garrett's patio on\r\nNovember 6, 2000.  He stated that he saw a couple of flower pots that interested him\r\nand wanted to get a closer look.  He explained that he could see the flower pots from\r\nthe walkway. In order to get a better look at the flowerpots, he \"crossed over\" the\r\nfence surrounding the patio.  Appellant had no intention of taking the flower pots, and\r\nhe had no idea that anyone was in the apartment.\r\n\r\n\tA motion to suppress the confession was filed during pretrial and a hearing was\r\nheld on that motion.  The purpose of the hearing was to determine if the confession\r\nwas given voluntarily.  The trial court ruled that the confession was given voluntarily\r\nand found it admissible.  During trial, Patton was unable to make a positive\r\nidentification of appellant, testifying, \"the man sitting over here looks somewhat like\r\nhim, but I can't swear to it.\"  She likewise was unable to make a positive\r\nidentification of appellant's voice from the recorded confession, testifying only that\r\nappellant's voice was \"similar\" to her assailant's.\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n\r\n\tIn five points of error, appellant argues that (1) the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion by allowing the State to offer evidence of extraneous offenses to prove\r\nappellant's identity as the offender; (2) the evidence was legally insufficient to\r\nsupport his conviction; (3) the evidence was factually insufficient to support his\r\nconviction; (4) he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel did\r\nnot obtain pretrial rulings or object to the admissibility of the State's evidence; and\r\n(5) he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of the cumulative effect of\r\nthe errors of counsel.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\n\tExtraneous Offense\r\n\r\n\tIn his first point of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion by improperly allowing the State to offer extraneous conduct pursuant to\r\nTexas Rule of Evidence 404(b) to prove his identity as the offender.  Specifically,\r\nappellant contends that no requisite connective similarities between the charged\r\noffense and the extraneous offense exist and that they are too remote in time to be\r\nadmissible. (3)\r\n\r\n\tWe review the decision to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\r\nunder an abuse of discretion standard of appellate review.  See Roberts v. State, 29\r\nS.W.3d 596, 600 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet. ref'd).  As long as the\r\ntrial court's ruling was within the \"zone of reasonable disagreement,\" there is no\r\nabuse of discretion, and we must uphold the ruling.  Id. \r\n\r\n\tAs a general rule, to prevent an accused from being prosecuted for some\r\ncollateral crime or misconduct, the State may not introduce evidence of bad acts\r\nsimilar to the offense charged.  Id. at 600-01.  However, as an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule of exclusion, evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" may be\r\nadmissible if it has relevance to a material issue other than to show that the accused\r\nacted in conformity with some trait of character and the probative value of the\r\nevidence is not \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"  Id. at\r\n601.  Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is relevant apart from showing\r\ncharacter conformity if the proponent shows that it \"tends to establish some elemental\r\nfact, such as identity or intent.\"  Id.\r\n\r\n\tIdentity may be placed at issue or in dispute through the cross-examination of\r\nthe identifying witness.  Page v. State, 88 S.W.3d 755, 763 (Tex. App.--Corpus\r\nChristi 2002, pet. ref'd).  This occurs only when the identifying witness has been\r\nimpeached about (1) a material detail of the identification; (2) the conditions\r\nsurrounding the charged offense and the witness's identification of the defendant in\r\nthat situation; or (3) an earlier misidentification of the defendant.  Id.  \r\n\r\n\tIn this case, Patton could not visually identify appellant as the intruder. \r\nIdentity was placed at issue by appellant through his cross-examination of Patton\r\nregarding whether she could identify him because of the lighting in her home,\r\nwhether she saw him long enough to identify him, and whether she was wearing her\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n\tTo be admissible to show identity, an extraneous offense must be so similar to\r\nthe offense charged that the offenses are marked as the accused's handiwork.  Lane\r\nv. State, 933 S.W.2d 504, 519 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).  In other words, to be relevant,\r\nthe evidence must bear the \"signature\" of the offender.  Linder v. State, 828 S.W.2d\r\n290, 297 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, pet. ref'd).  If there are sufficient\r\ncommon distinguishing characteristics between the extraneous offense and the\r\ncharged offense such that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its\r\nprejudicial effect, the court may admit the evidence.  Id.  The factors of remoteness\r\nand similarity of an extraneous offense are important, not in and of themselves, but\r\nonly as they bear on the relevancy and probative value of the offered evidence of\r\nextraneous offenses.  Id.  Therefore, remoteness or dissimilarity do not per se\u00a0render\r\nan extraneous offense irrelevant.  See id.  The extraneous offense and the charged\r\noffense can, therefore, be different offenses, so long as the similarities between the\r\ntwo offenses are such that the evidence is relevant. Id.\r\n\r\n\tTo determine the similarity between the offenses for the purpose of establishing\r\nidentity, appellate courts should take into account both the specific characteristics of\r\nthe offenses and the time interval between them.  Johnson v. State, 68 S.W.3d 644,\r\n651 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (citing Lane, 933 S.W.2d at 519).  Sufficient similarity\r\nmay be shown by proximity in time and place or by a common mode of committing\r\nthe offenses.  Lane, 933 S.W.2d at 519 (citing Ransom v. State, 503 S.W.2d 810, 813\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1974)).\r\n\r\n\tIn Walker v. State, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that offenses were\r\nsufficiently similar because (1) they occurred (a) at night, (b) in the same area, (c)\r\nwithin a period of one month; (2) the defendant (a) was alone and (b) carried a small\r\ngun; (3) the victims were tied in a similar manner; (4) the robbery preceded the rape;\r\nand (5) all coins but pennies were taken from the victims.  588 S.W.2d 920, 924 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1979).  In Ransom, the Court of Criminal Appeals held that offenses were\r\nsufficiently similar because (1) the offenses were three days apart and both offenses\r\nwere (2) robberies (3) committed at gunpoint (4) by the defendant and an accomplice. \r\n503 S.W.2d at 813.\r\n\r\n\tMore recently, in Lane, the Court of Criminal Appeals held that, although the\r\ntime and place of the offenses were not in close proximity, were a decade apart and\r\ntook place in different states, the mode of committing the offense and the\r\ncircumstances surrounding them were sufficiently similar for the extraneous offense\r\nto be relevant to the issue of identity.  933 S.W.2d at 519.  In Johnson, the Court of\r\nAppeals held that offenses committed within a few hours of each other, directed at\r\nlone women, and involving another victim's red Ford Taurus were sufficiently\r\nsimilar. (4)  68 S.W.3d at 650-52.      \r\n\r\n\tIn the instant case, Garrett and Patton were both women in their late sixties or\r\nearly seventies; they lived alone a half-mile apart.  Both had been harassed for some\r\ntime over approximately the same period, always at night; the assault on Patton\r\noccurred in December, 1999; the harassment of Garrett began a year before that, and\r\nappellant was arrested outside Garrett's apartment 11 months after the assault on\r\nPatton.  During this time there were many reports of a peeping tom at the complex\r\nwhere Garrett lived.  The intruder entered Patton's house by breaking a back window\r\nand then armed himself with a knife from her kitchen; appellant was apprehended on\r\nGarrett's patio with a long, bent wire for gaining entry into a patio door and a\r\nflashlight.  The intruder sexually assaulted Patton; someone left pornographic pictures\r\nof elderly women outside Garrett's door the night before appellant was arrested on\r\nher patio with a tool for gaining entry.  Patton described her assailant as a tall black\r\nman wearing gold-rimmed glasses; appellant is a tall black man who was wearing\r\ngold-rimmed glasses when arrested.  Patton produced a sketch that closely resembled\r\nappellant.\r\n\r\n\tWe must uphold the trial court's decision to admit evidence of other crimes,\r\nwrongs, or acts so long as the court's ruling was within the \"zone of reasonable\r\ndisagreement.\"  Roberts, 29 S.W.3d at 600.  We find that there were sufficient\r\ncommon distinguishing characteristics between the extraneous offense and the\r\ncharged offense of burglary of a habitation with the intent to commit sexual assault. \r\nFurthermore, we find that the time period between the charged offense and the\r\nextraneous offense, 11 months, is not so remote in time to be inadmissible under the\r\ncircumstances of this case.  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\r\nin admitting the extraneous offense evidence. \r\n\r\n\tWe overrule appellant's first point of error.\r\n\r\n\tLegal and Factual Sufficiency\r\n\r\n\tIn his second and third points of error, appellant argues that the evidence was\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to support his conviction.  \r\n\r\n\tIn reviewing legal sufficiency, we view the evidence in a light most favorable\r\nto the verdict and ask whether any rational trier-of-fact could find the essential\r\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  King v. State, 29 S.W.3d 556, 562\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000); Valencia v. State, 51 S.W.3d 418, 423 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] 2001, pet. ref'd).  The fact finder may reasonably infer facts from the\r\nevidence before it, credit the witnesses if it cares to, disbelieve any or all of the\r\ntestimony proffered, and weigh the evidence in the manner it chooses.  Bruno v. State,\r\n922 S.W.2d 292, 293 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1996, no pet.). \r\n\r\n\tIn reviewing factual sufficiency, we examine all the evidence neutrally and ask\r\nwhether proof of guilt is so obviously weak as to undermine confidence in the jury's\r\ndetermination or so greatly outweighed by contrary proof as to indicate that a\r\nmanifest injustice has occurred.  Zuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589, 594 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 2003); King, 29 S.W.3d at 563; Valencia, 51 S.W.3d at 423.  While conducting\r\nour analysis, if there is probative evidence supporting the verdict, we must avoid\r\nsubstituting our judgment for that of the trier-of-fact, even when we disagree with the\r\ndetermination.  King, 29 S.W.3d at 563.  The trier-of-fact is the sole judge of the\r\nweight and credibility of the witness testimony.  Johnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 7\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\r\n\r\n\tA person commits burglary if, without the effective consent of the owner, the\r\nperson enters a habitation and commits or attempts to commit a felony, theft, or an\r\nassault.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) (Vernon 2003).  To sustain a conviction\r\nfor burglary of a habitation with the intent to commit sexual assault, a first degree\r\nfelony, it must be shown that appellant entered the habitation with the intent to\r\ncommit sexual assault.  Id. \u00a7 30.02(d).\r\n\r\n\tEvidence other than the extraneous offense evidence discussed above was\r\noffered at trial.  Patton testified that, on the night in question, the doorbell rang\r\n\"insistently\" around 4:00 a.m.; she ran down the hallway from her bedroom by the\r\nliving room and ran into an intruder; she asked the intruder what he was doing in her\r\nhome, what his name was, and what he wanted; she pinned herself up against the wall\r\nnear the living room; the intruder groped her body, including her breasts; the intruder\r\ntalked about her legs, saying they were very strong legs; she told the intruder that she\r\nplayed tennis; and the intruder had a nice soft-spoken voice.  Patton testified that she\r\ndid not know that the window in her breakfast room had been broken because the\r\nintruder had told her that her door was unlocked.\r\n\r\n\tPatton described the intruder as a black male in his early thirties with little to\r\nno hair and gold-rimmed glasses.  A sketch of the intruder that was drawn a few\r\nweeks after the incident was introduced into evidence.  Also, Patton identified\r\nappellant as the intruder, although with the caveat that she could not \"swear to it,\"\r\nand identified appellant's voice on the audio-taped confession as similar to the\r\nintruder.\t\r\n\r\n\tIn his confession, which was played to the jury, appellant admitted to his\r\ninterest in older women and admitted to looking into other people's homes because\r\nhe was attracted to the light coming from the windows.  Appellant stated that he was\r\nface-to-face with only one woman around a year before the confession; identified the\r\nwoman that he hurt as someone who plays tennis; admitted that he was in the\r\nwoman's home; admitted that he rang her door bell; and admitted that he was not let\r\ninto the woman's home by the woman, but that he entered through a door, either the\r\ngarage or the kitchen door, which he claimed was open.  He described the woman as\r\nCaucasian and in her fifties or sixties.  He admitted that he fondled the woman's\r\nbreasts and rubbed her legs near or in her living room where the woman was standing;\r\nand he admitted that her legs interested him the most.  He stated that the woman told\r\nhim what he was doing was wrong; the woman told him he looked like a nice person\r\nthat would not do something like this; the woman asked why he was doing what he\r\nwas doing; and the woman said to appellant, \"God bless [you].\"  He stated that he left\r\nafter the woman asked him to leave and that the woman told him she would pray for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant testified at trial that he had never seen Patton until trial.  Appellant\r\ndenied burglarizing Patton's home.  \r\n\r\n\tViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we hold that\r\nthe evidence was legally sufficient for a rational trier-of-fact to find the essential\r\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  Viewing the evidence neutrally,\r\nwe observe that the jury decided, in this case, to believe Patton and appellant's tape\r\nrecorded  confession and to disbelieve appellant's testimony.  Because the jury, as\r\ntrier-of-fact, is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the witness testimony,\r\nand because the proof of guilt was not so obviously weak as to undermine confidence\r\nin the jury's determination, or so greatly outweighed by contrary proof as to indicate\r\nthat a manifest injustice occurred, we hold that the evidence was factually sufficient \r\nto support the verdict.  \t\r\n\r\n\tWe overrule appellant's second and third points of error.\r\n\r\n\tIneffective Assistance of Counsel\r\n\r\n\tIn his fourth and fifth points of error, appellant argues that, when looking at the\r\ntotality of the representation, he was denied effective assistance of counsel during the\r\nguilt/innocense phase of the trial because trial counsel did not seek and obtain pretrial\r\nrulings or object to the admissibility of the State's evidence; and he was denied\r\neffective assistance of counsel because of the cumulative effect of those errors.  We\r\naddress both points of error together.\r\n\r\n\tTo determine if a defendant has been denied effective assistance of counsel, we\r\nfollow the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.\r\nCt. 2052, 2064 (1984).  First, appellant must demonstrate that counsel's\r\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing\r\nprofessional norms.  Howland v. State, 966 S.W.2d 98, 104 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1998), aff'd, 990 S.W.2d 274 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  Second, appellant must\r\nestablish that counsel's performance was so prejudicial that it deprived him of a fair\r\ntrial.  Id.  Thus, appellant must show that a reasonable probability exists that, but for\r\ncounsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\r\ndifferent.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068; Howland, 966 S.W.2d at\r\n104.  Appellant has the burden to establish both of these prongs by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence.  Jackson v. State, 973 S.W.2d 954, 956 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998);\r\nDavis v. State, 830 S.W.2d 762, 765 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, pet.\r\nref'd).  We cannot speculate beyond the record provided.  Jackson v. State, 877\r\nS.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); Gamble v. State, 916 S.W.2d 92, 93 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no pet.).  Appellant must overcome the presumption\r\nthat trial counsel's strategy was sound.  Gamble, 916 S.W.2d at 93.\r\n\r\n\tAn appellant \"making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts\r\nor omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable\r\nprofessional judgment.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.  Any allegation of\r\nineffectiveness must be firmly founded in the record, and the record must\r\naffirmatively demonstrate the alleged ineffectiveness.   Thompson v. State, 9 S.W.3d\r\n808, 813 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  Although there was a motion for new trial and a\r\nhearing on that motion, the record from that hearing is silent as to what appellant's\r\ntrial counsels' strategy was during trial.  To find that trial counsel was ineffective\r\nbased on any of the asserted grounds would call for speculation, which we will not\r\ndo.  Gamble, 916 S.W.2d at 93.  Moreover, appellant has made no showing that, but\r\nfor his counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n\tWe overrule appellant's fourth and fifth points of error.Conclusion\r\n\r\n\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEvelyn V. Keyes\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice\r\n\r\n\r\nPanel consists of Justices Taft, Keyes, and Higley.\r\n\r\nJustice Higley, concurring.\r\n\r\nPublish.  Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\r\n1. \tSee Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(d) (Vernon 2003); id. \u00a7 22.011(f).\t\r\n2. \tSee id. \u00a7 12.32.\r\n3. \tAppellant also complains that other evidence improper under Rule 404(b) was\r\noffered against him to prove identity.  Specifically, he complains that Patton's\r\ntestimony that someone had been ringing her doorbell late at night for more than a\r\nyear, May's testimony that he had been dispatched to Garrett's apartment many times\r\nfor peeping tom cases and that other peeping tom incidents had occurred, and\r\nGarrett's testimony that someone had been looking in her window and leaving\r\npornographic material on her doorstep were improperly offered as extraneous offense\r\nevidence by the State.  He also complains that the State did not provide notice that\r\nthis evidence was going to be offered at trial.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant's trial counsel objected to the admissibility of the extraneous offense\r\ncommitted against Garrett under Rules 403 and 404(b), but failed to object to any\r\nother extraneous offense evidence or to lack of notice that the evidence would be\r\noffered.  Therefore, appellant has failed to preserve error with regard to lack of notice\r\nor to any extraneous offenses, other than the criminal trespass against Garrett, \r\naddressed above, and these issues are waived.  See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).  We note,\r\nhowever, that the State did provide notice to appellant that evidence of extraneous\r\noffenses that occurred from January, 2000 through June, 2000, would be offered at\r\ntrial.  Specifically, the State notified appellant that \"[t]hroughout the year 2000 there\r\nwere several trespass reports regarding Ms. Garrett, Ms. [Kelley] Cooksey and the\r\napartment complex in which they lived.  The defendant is a suspect in each case.\"\r\n4. \tSee also Pena v. State, 867 S.W.2d 97, 99 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1993,\r\npet. ref'd) (addressing similarities between the charged offense and extraneous\r\noffense involving elderly individuals); Contreras v. State, 838 S.W.2d 594, 599-600\r\n(Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1992, pet. ref'd) (listing similarities between charged\r\noffense and extraneous offense involving elderly individuals, although not directly\r\naddressing whether offenses had sufficient similarities); but see Reyes v. State, 69\r\nS.W.3d 725, 738-41 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2002, pet. ref'd) (finding that\r\nsimilarities between two offenses were common to crime itself, namely burglary of\r\nhabitation with intent to commit and committing sexual assault, rather than\r\nsimilarities peculiar to offenses; similarities were that intruder, not wearing glasses,\r\nentered two residences in same vicinity, in early morning hours, fondled victims\r\nwhile they slept with child, and fled when they awoke; dissimilarities between\r\noffenses included that victims were not of same race;  intruder was fully clothed in\r\none, but wearing nothing but boxer shorts in other; on earlier occasion intruder\r\nfondled both breasts and vaginal area of person, while on latter intruder fondled only\r\nvaginal area, which resulted in penetration with his fingers;  bedroom in extraneous\r\noffense was not lit, but bedroom of victim in charged offense was well lit by exterior\r\nlight; several people were home in first offense, but only victim and her son were\r\nhome in charged offense;  and entry in extraneous offense was gained by using chair\r\nand climbing through window, but in charged offense it was through unlocked\r\ngarage); Avila v. State, 18 S.W.3d 736, 740-42 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 2000, no\r\npet.) (determining that similarities between two offenses were not substantial enough\r\nto warrant admissibility of extraneous offense; similarities were that both offenses\r\noccurred within city limits of Crystal City in darkness and at night, to victims who\r\nwere asleep and who did not give consent to intruder to enter rooms; in both offenses\r\nvictims were turned over and sexual act was in essentially same position; court held\r\nthat similarities between the two offenses were those common to crime itself and not\r\n\"similarities peculiar to both offenses\").\r\n\r\n\r\n",
