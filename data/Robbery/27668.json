(Senate Bill No. 1437) and failure to consider striking or reducing his firearm\nenhancement under Senate Bill No. 620 (2017-2018 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill No. 620).\nDefendant contends the trial court erred: (1) in determining the resentencing provisions\nof Penal Code section 1170.95 only apply to persons convicted of murder and not\nattempted murder; (2) in denying his request for resentencing prior to appointing counsel\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fto represent him; and (3) in failing to consider defendant\u2019s request for reduction of his\nfirearm enhancement.1 We disagree and will affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n                                    I. BACKGROUND\n         On April 9, 2002, the People filed an amended complaint charging defendant and\na codefendant in count 1 with murder (\u00a7 187) and numerous enhancements, including an\nallegation that defendant personally discharged a firearm causing injury (\u00a7 12022.53,\nsubd. (d)) and committed the crime to benefit a street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)).\nCounts 2 through 6 charged defendant and his codefendant with attempted murder\n(\u00a7\u00a7 664/187) and included special allegations that defendant personally discharged a\nfirearm causing injury (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)) and intentionally discharged a firearm\n(\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c)). Finally, count 7 charged defendant\u2019s codefendant with robbery\n(\u00a7 211), and count 8 charged defendant and his codefendant with the substantive offense\nof street terrorism (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)).\n         The court\u2019s September 25, 2003 minute order reflects that on the seventh day of\ndefendant\u2019s jury trial, the parties reached a resolution of the case. Defense counsel stated\nfor the record that defendant did not fire a weapon. The court granted the People\u2019s\nmotion to amend count 1 to charge attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187) with a gun\nenhancement under section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (e)(1). The court further\nstruck the \u201cwillful and deliberate\u201d allegations from counts 2 through 6. Defendant then\npled guilty to count 1 and admitted the gun enhancement (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c), (e)(1))\nand the gang enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). All remaining enhancements as to all\ncounts were stricken. Defendant also pled guilty to attempted murder in counts 2 through\n6 and to the street terrorism charge.\n\n\n\n\n1   Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                              2\n\f       The minute order and abstract of judgment reflect that defendant was sentenced\nthe same day to three years on count 1, plus 20 years consecutive for the gun\nenhancement, plus three years concurrent for the gang enhancement for a total aggregate\nprison term of 23 years. He also received sentences of the mid-term of six years for each\nattempted murder count, to run concurrently to count 1, and a sentence of two years to\nrun concurrently for the street terrorism conviction. There is no indication in the record\nor this court\u2019s files that defendant appealed this judgment.\n       On December 31, 2018, defendant filed a pro per request asking the court to:\n(1) correct the abstract of judgment to reflect that he actually pled guilty in count 1 to\nvoluntary manslaughter, not attempted murder; (2) consider modifying his gun\nenhancement \u201cfrom 23 years to 10 years\u201d; and (3) consider resentencing defendant in\nlight of Senate Bill No. 1437. Attached to this request was the reporter\u2019s transcript of the\nplea hearing wherein the People did indeed amend the information to reflect a charge of\nvoluntary manslaughter for count 1, and defendant pled guilty to that charge.\n       On February 25, 2019, the trial court issued an ex parte order modifying the\nabstract of judgment as requested and denying defendant\u2019s request for resentencing\npursuant to Senate Bill No. 1437, stating: \u201cPer PC 1170.95(a), the resentencing\nprovisions [o]f SB1437 only apply to persons convicted of 1st or 2nd degree murder.\nThe Petitioner was convicted of \u2018attempted\u2019 murder, not murder and, therefore, does not\nqualify for resentencing under SB1437.\u201d The order did not address defendant\u2019s request\nto modify the gun enhancement. Defendant timely appealed and did not request a\ncertificate of probable cause.\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\nA.     Section 1170.95 is Inapplicable to Voluntary Manslaughter and Attempted Murder\n       Defendant argues the trial court erred in summarily denying his request for\nresentencing after finding section 1170.95 only applies to persons convicted of murder.\nHe reasons he is entitled to further proceedings because section 1170.95 is applicable to\n\n                                              3\n\fhis convictions for both voluntary manslaughter and attempted murder. We join those\ncourts that have found that the plain language of section 1170.95 demonstrates it is\ninapplicable to any conviction other than for felony murder or murder under a natural and\nprobable consequences theory.\n       \u201c \u2018If the language [of a statute] is clear, courts must generally follow its plain\nmeaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the\nLegislature did not intend.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Flores (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 985, 992\n(Flores).)\n       Senate Bill No. 1437 was enacted to \u201camend the felony murder rule and the\nnatural and probable consequences doctrine, . . . to ensure that murder liability is not\nimposed on a person who is not the actual killer, did not act with the intent to kill, or was\nnot a major participant in the underlying felony who acted with reckless indifference to\nhuman life.\u201d (Stats. 2018, ch. 1015, \u00a7 1(f).) Senate Bill No. 1437 achieved these goals\nby amending sections 188 and 189, statutes pertaining to the crime of murder. The\nlegislation also added section 1170.95, which provides a mechanism for defendants\n\u201cconvicted of felony murder or murder under a natural and probable consequences\ntheory\u201d (\u00a7 1170.95, subd. (a)) to file a petition in the sentencing court to have a murder\nconviction vacated and to be resentenced.\n       \u201c[S]ection 1170.95 authorizes only a person who was \u2018convicted of felony murder\nor murder under a natural and probable consequences theory [to] file a petition with the\ncourt that sentenced the petitioner to have the petitioner\u2019s murder conviction\nvacated . . . .\u2019 (Id., subd. (a), italics added.) If the petitioner makes a prima facie\nshowing that he or she is entitled to relief, the sentencing court must \u2018hold a hearing to\ndetermine whether to vacate the murder conviction and to recall the sentence and\nresentence the petitioner on any remaining counts . . . .\u2019 (Id., subd. (d)(1), italics added.)\nIn lieu of a resentencing hearing, the parties may stipulate that \u2018the petitioner is eligible to\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fhave his or her murder conviction vacated\u2019 and to be resentenced. (Id., subd. (d)(2),\nitalics added.)\u201d (Flores, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p. 993.)\n       Numerous courts have reviewed the language of section 1170.95, subdivision (a)\nand found it inapplicable to challenges by defendants with final judgments for\nconvictions of attempted murder (People v. Lopez (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 1087, 1104-\n1105 [section 1170.95 authorizes petitions by those convicted of murder directed at that\nindividual\u2019s murder conviction], review granted Nov. 13, 2019, S258175; People v.\nMunoz (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 738, 754-756 [the plain language of section 1170.95 does\nnot encompass attempted murder], review granted Nov. 26, 2019, S258234; People v.\nLarios (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 956, 961, 969-970 [same], review granted Feb. 26, 2020,\nS259983; People v. Medrano (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 1001, 1008, 1018 [same], review\ngranted Mar. 11, 2020, S259948) and voluntary manslaughter (People v. Sanchez (2020)\n48 Cal.App.5th 914, 920 [\u201csection 1170.95 relief is not available to those offenders who\nplead guilty to voluntary manslaughter\u201d] (Sanchez); Flores, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at\npp. 992-994 [section 1170.95 does not apply to voluntary manslaughter]; People v.\nTurner (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 428, 433 [same] (Turner); People v. Cervantes (2020)\n44 Cal.App.5th 884, 887 [section 1170.95 \u201cunequivocally applies to murder convictions\u201d\nnot voluntary manslaughter]).\n       We conclude that section 1170.95, subdivision (a)(2)\u2019s reference to having\n\u201caccepted a plea offer in lieu of a trial at which the petitioner could be convicted for first\ndegree or second degree murder\u201d should expand section 1170.95\u2019s available relief to\nindividuals who pled guilty to something less than first or second degree murder. (See\nSanchez, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at pp. 918-919 [attempting to use the plea portion of\nsubdivision (a)(2) to expand available relief ignores the plain language of the introduction\n\u201c \u2018that limits petitions to persons \u201cconvicted of . . . murder\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; Flores, supra,\n44 Cal.App.5th at p. 995 [this clause must be read in context and \u201cthe remaining portions\nof section 1170.95 repeatedly and exclusively refer to murder, not manslaughter\u201d];\n\n                                               5\n\fTurner, supra, 45 Cal.App.5th at pp. 438 [\u201c[v]iewed together, the legislative history\nconfirms that a defendant who faces murder liability under the natural and probable\nconsequences doctrine, but pleads guilty to manslaughter in lieu of trial, is not eligible for\nresentencing under section 1170.95\u201d].)\n       Nor is an expansive view of section 1170.95 warranted by uncodified legislative\nfindings and declarations which state: \u201cThere is a need for statutory changes to more\nequitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in homicides.\u201d (Stats.\n2018, ch. 1015, \u00a7 1, subd. (b), italics added.) Defendant is mistaken that this uncodified\nmention of homicide, which he argues includes voluntary manslaughter, justifies a\nbroader interpretation that Senate Bill No. 1437 was intended to apply to all homicide\nconvictions. While relevant to interpreting a statute, such uncodified statements cannot\nbe used to \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018confer power, determine rights, or enlarge the scope of [the]\nmeasure.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Flores, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p. 995.) Further, to the extent this\nstatement is relevant, it demonstrates the Legislature could have used the term\n\u201chomicide\u201d if it had intended a broader application, and the Legislature\u2019s decision not to\n\u201csuggests a purposeful determination not to extend the resentencing provision to all types\nof homicide.\u201d (Id. at p. 996.)\n       Finally, we do not agree that interpreting the statute to disallow claims for relief\nfor individuals convicted of anything less than the specified murder convictions leads to\nan absurd result or renders language of section 1170.95, subdivision (a)(2) superfluous.\nThese arguments have been considered and rejected. (See, e.g., Sanchez, supra,\n48 Cal.App.5th at p. 919 [no absurd result, citing People v. Cervantes, supra,\n44 Cal.App.5th at p. 887; Flores, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at pp. 996-997; Turner, supra,\n45 Cal.App.5th at pp. 438-439]; Sanchez, supra, at p. 919 [clarifying that section 1170.95\napplies to both murder convictions by plea or trial is not surplusage].)\n       In light of our conclusion that section 1170.95 petitions for resentencing are\nlimited to those defendants with convictions for felony murder or murder under a natural\n\n                                              6\n\fand probable consequences theory, defendant had no right to the appointment of counsel.\n(See People v. Verdugo (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 320, 323, review granted Mar. 18, 2020,\nS260493 [where defendant fails to state a prima facie claim for relief under section\n1170.95, the court does not error in failing to appoint counsel]; People v. Cornelius\n(2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 54, 58 [court did not error in failing to appoint counsel for\ndefendant \u201cindisputably ineligible for relief\u201d under section 1170.95].) Accordingly, we\nsummarily reject defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s failure to appoint such counsel\nviolated his rights.\nB.     Senate Bill No. 620\n       Defendant further contends he is entitled to remand so that the trial court may\nexercise its discretion to strike or reduce the section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (e)(1)\nfirearm enhancement pursuant to Senate Bill No. 620. He argues both that the\namendment to section 12022.53 created an independent right to resentencing for final\ncases and also that he was before the court which was correcting errors in his sentence\nand thus, he was eligible for reconsideration under section 12022.53, subdivision (h). We\ndisagree.2\n       When defendant was sentenced in 2003, the court had no discretion to strike or\ndismiss a firearm use enhancement. (See former \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (h)\n[\u201c[n]otwithstanding Section 1385 or any other provision of law, the court shall not strike\nan allegation under this section or a finding bringing a person within the provisions of\nthis section\u201d].) \u201cHowever, Senate Bill No. 620 amended the statute, effective January 1,\n2018, to give the trial court discretion, in limited circumstances, pursuant to section 1385,\nto strike a firearm enhancement in the interest of justice. [Citation.] Subdivision (h) of\n\n\n\n2In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v. Stamps (2020) 9 Cal.5th 685, 692,\nwe will not address the People\u2019s argument that defendant was required to first obtain a\ncertificate of probable cause in order to seek retroactive relief of Senate Bill No. 620.\n\n                                              7\n\fsection 12022.53 now provides, \u2018The court may, in the interest of justice pursuant to\nSection 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise\nrequired to be imposed by this section. The authority provided by this subdivision\napplies to any resentencing that may occur pursuant to any other law.\u2019 \u201d (People v.\nJohnson (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 938, 941.) This provision is not fully retroactive.\n(People v. Hernandez (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 323, 326-327 [rejecting defendant\u2019s equal\nprotection full retroactivity argument].)\n       Section 12022.53 extends the benefits of Senate Bill No. 620 to defendants who\nhave exhausted their rights to appeal and for whom a judgment of conviction has been\nentered, but who have obtained collateral relief by way of a state or federal habeas\nproceeding or other post judgment motions. (People v. Johnson, supra, 32 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 941; see also People v. Arredondo (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 493, 507.) This deadline\npassed for defendant many years ago. (See People v. Vieira (2005) 35 Cal.4th 264, 306\n[finality for purposes of retroactive application of a criminal statute occurs after the time\nfor petitioning to the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari has\npassed].)\n       We do not agree with defendant\u2019s claim that he was before the court for a\ncorrection in sentencing entitling him to relief. First, correction of an abstract of\njudgment is a clerical matter. It is not a resentencing for purposes of section 12022.53,\nsubdivision (h). (People v. Humphrey (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 371, 379-380.) Second,\ndefendant is not entitled to relief by virtue of the Senate Bill No. 1437 request. Section\n1170.95 itself is explicit that a defendant\u2019s sentence is not recalled by virtue of the filing\nof the petition. Rather, it is only after (1) the court has determined the petitioner made a\nprima facie showing that petitioner falls within the provisions of the statute and is entitled\nto relief (\u00a7 1170.95, subd. (c)), and (2) the prosecution has failed to carry its burden of\nproving the petitioner is ineligible for resentencing (id., subd. (d)(3)), that the murder\nconviction may be vacated and the sentence recalled (id., subd. (d)(1)).
