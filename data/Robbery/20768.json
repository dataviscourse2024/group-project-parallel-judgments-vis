On February 23, 2010, the trial court sentenced appellant to confinement\nfor 16 years in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\nAppellant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s appointed counsel filed a brief in which he concludes the appeal is\nwholly frivolous and without merit. The brief meets the requirements of Anders v.\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396 (1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of\n\fthe record and demonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to be advanced. See\nHigh v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978).\n\n       A copy of counsel\u2019s brief was delivered to appellant. Appellant was advised of the\nright to examine the appellate record and file a pro se response. See Stafford v. State, 813\nS.W.2d 503, 510 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). As of this date, more than forty-five days have\npassed and no pro se response has been filed.\n\n       We have carefully reviewed the record and counsel\u2019s brief and agree the appeal is\nwholly frivolous and without merit. Further, we find no reversible error in the record.\nWe are not to address the merits of each claim raised in an Anders brief or a pro se response\nwhen we have determined there are no arguable grounds for review. See Bledsoe v. State,\n178 S.W.3d 824, 827\u201328 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n\n       Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                          PER CURIAM\n\nPanel consists of Justices Frost, Seymore, and Jamison.\nDo Not Publish \u2014 Tex. R. App. P. 47.2(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f",
