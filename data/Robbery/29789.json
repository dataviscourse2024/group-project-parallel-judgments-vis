He then sued Appellant Texas Department of State Health Services (the Department),\n\nthe agency currently responsible for overseeing the Center, raising claims of gender, national\n\norigin, and disability discrimination, in addition to retaliation and sexual harassment.\n\n       The Department filed a plea to the jurisdiction, challenging with evidence several elements\n\nof Resendiz\u2019s claims. The trial court denied the plea in its entirety For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we agree with the Department that Resendiz failed to establish a prima facie case of gender\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation. And even assuming Resendiz presented a prima facie case for\n\fthese, and his other claims, he failed to sufficiently rebut the Department\u2019s evidence that he was\n\nterminated based on its belief that he committed theft. This failure negates his gender, national\n\norigin, disability discrimination, and retaliation theories. We further conclude that while he lacks\n\nevidence to support a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim, he does have sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport his claim for sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment. We therefore\n\nreverse in part and affirm in part the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                  I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n        A. The Alleged Theft\n\n        The Center is a state hospital that provides psychiatric services to citizens of Texas.\n\nResendiz was hired to work at the Center in November of 2002 as a Maintenance Specialist IV\n\nunder the supervision of Josefina Herrera, the Center\u2019s Support Services Director. Resendiz\u2019s job\n\nresponsibilities included construction and general maintenance work, and as such, he had access\n\nto all areas of the Center, including the loading dock and supply room.\n\n        On January 20, 2014, Herrera and her administrative assistant, Lazaro Sanchez, reviewed\n\nvideo footage of the loading dock area which showed Edgar Garcia, Resendiz\u2019s co-worker, take a\n\nroll of vinyl flooring from a storage area behind the loading dock, place it on a dolly, roll it outside,\n\nand leave it near a large dumpster. Shortly thereafter, Resendiz can be seen exiting through the\n\nloading dock carrying what appeared to be a bucket of flooring adhesive, and walking in the\n\ngeneral direction of the same dumpster. Resendiz is then seen walking back to the loading dock\n\nempty-handed. There is nothing in the video to indicate that either of the two items were ever\n\nreturned to the loading dock, and a subsequent inventory review revealed that a roll of vinyl\n\nflooring valued at $1,596 and a 5-gallon bucket of flooring adhesive valued at $37.40 were\n\nmissing. In addition, a car was later seen entering the loading dock area and momentarily parking\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fnear the dumpster area where the supplies had been left; the ownership of the car was never\n\nestablished.\n\n       According to Herrera, after confirming that the vinyl flooring was missing, she confronted\n\nGarcia, who advised her that he thought he had brought the vinyl back to the loading dock. She\n\ndid not, however, initially realize that the adhesive was missing, and therefore did not question\n\nResendiz about that item. Herrera then consulted with her then-supervisor, David Osterhout, and\n\nthe matter was referred to the Texas Office of Inspector General (OIG) to investigate whether\n\nGarcia and Resendiz had stolen the missing property. Although the investigator believed that the\n\ntwo men may have been working together, he conducted separate investigations to determine\n\nwhether Garcia had stolen the vinyl flooring and whether Resendiz had stolen the bucket of\n\nadhesive. The investigator reviewed the video footage, the inventory receipts, and spoke with\n\nvarious witnesses, including Resendiz, who denied taking the adhesive from the loading dock, and\n\nfurther denied seeing Garcia move the vinyl flooring. Garcia, on the other hand, advised the\n\ninvestigator that he recalled seeing Resendiz take a bucket of adhesive from the loading docket,\n\nbut did not ask him why he had done so. Garcia claimed that he took the vinyl flooring from the\n\nloading dock as it was obstructed the work area, but then forgot to return it to the dock.\n\n       After completing his investigation, the investigator issued two separate reports finding that\n\nthe theft charges against both men were \u201csubstantiated.\u201d In finding that the charge against\n\nResendiz was substantiated, he noted that it was unclear on the video whether the bucket that\n\nResendiz was seen carrying to the dumpster area was full or not. But given that a similar sized\n\nbucket of adhesive was later found to be missing, he deduced that Resendiz had in fact taken the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fadhesive. 1    The investigator referred the theft charge against Resendiz to the El Paso City\n\nAttorney\u2019s office, but that office never brought any charges. The theft charge against Garcia,\n\nhowever, was referred to the El Paso County Attorney\u2019s office, and following a jury trial, Garcia\n\nwas acquitted.\n\n         B. The Termination\n\n         The Center sent Resendiz a \u201cNotice of Possible Disciplinary Action\u201d on February 27, 2017,\n\nsigned by both Herrera and Osterhout, which notified him that the OIG investigation had\n\nsubstantiated the theft charge, and that this subjected him to possible disciplinary action.\n\nAlthough the notice gave Resendiz the opportunity to provide \u201crebuttal information,\u201d Resendiz\n\ndeclined to do so. Osterhout notified Resendiz that he was being terminated effective February\n\n28, 2014.\n\n                                  II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n         Resendiz filed a charge of discrimination with the Texas Workforce Commission Civil\n\nRights Division, alleging discrimination under the Texas Commission Human Rights Act\n\n(TCHRA). After the Workforce Commission issued a right to sue letter, Resendiz filed his\n\nlawsuit against the Department, alleging unlawful discrimination based on gender (male), national\n\norigin (Mexican), and disability (hypertension). He further alleged that he was the victim of\n\n\u201cunlawful retaliation for engaging in protected activities, and a hostile work environment.\u201d After\n\nresponding to the suit and engaging in discovery, the Department filed a plea to the jurisdiction,\n\narguing that the jurisdictional evidence did not support a finding that Resendiz had been terminated\n\nfor any unlawful reason, or that he was the victim of a hostile work environment, and that the true\n\n\n\n1\n  Resendiz later testified during his deposition that the bucket he was seen taking to the dumpster area was empty and\nthat he was disposing of it as trash.\n\n                                                          4\n\fcause of his termination was the theft of the building supplies. The Department therefore claimed\n\nthat its governmental immunity from suit was not waived, and that the trial court therefore lacked\n\njurisdiction to hear the lawsuit. Resendiz responded, claiming that he had come forward with\n\nsufficient jurisdictional evidence to support his claims and to support a waiver of the Department\u2019s\n\nimmunity. Both parties submitted voluminous exhibits in support of their positions.\n\n       The trial court denied the plea in its entirety, and the Department filed an appeal from the\n\ntrial court\u2019s order. The Department raises one global issue contending the trial court failed to\n\ndismiss each of Resendiz\u2019s claims.\n\n                  III. APPLICABLE LAW AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       State agencies, such as the Department, are protected by sovereign immunity from lawsuits\n\nother than for claims for which their immunity has been waived by the legislature. Texas Dep\u2019t\n\nof Aging and Disability Services v. Lagunas, 546 S.W.3d 239, 246 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2017, no\n\npet.) citing Texas Parks & Wildlife Dep\u2019t v. Sawyer Trust, 354 S.W.3d 384, 388 (Tex. 2011).\n\nAbsent a waiver, a governmental unit\u2019s sovereign immunity deprives a trial court of subject matter\n\njurisdiction. Texas Dep\u2019t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 224 (Tex. 2004);\n\nTirado v. City of El Paso, 361 S.W.3d 191, 194 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2012, no pet.). The Texas\n\nLegislature has, however, created a limited waiver of immunity for discrimination claims brought\n\nunder the TCHRA. Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d 629, 636 (Tex.\n\n2012). That waiver, however, extends \u201conly for those suits where the plaintiff actually alleges a\n\nviolation of the TCHRA by pleading facts that state a claim thereunder.\u201d Id.\n\n       A governmental entity may challenge the validity of a plaintiff\u2019s claim through a plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 225-26. A plea may attack the face of the pleading but\n\nmay also include evidence which thereby places into issue the existence of a jurisdictional fact.\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fId. at 226-27. When, as here, a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of jurisdictional\n\nfacts, we consider all the relevant evidence submitted by the parties. Id. \u201cIf there is no question\n\nof fact as to the jurisdictional issue, the trial court must rule on the plea to the jurisdiction as a\n\nmatter of law.\u201d City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 378 (Tex. 2009). On the other\n\nhand, if the jurisdictional evidence creates a fact question, then the trial court cannot grant the plea\n\nto the jurisdiction, and the issue must be resolved by the fact finder. Lagunas, 546 S.W.3d at 246.\n\nOur review of the trial court\u2019s decision mirrors that of our review of summary judgments, which\n\nwe review de novo, accepting as true all evidence favorable to the non-movant, and indulging\n\nevery reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in the non-movant\u2019s favor. Id., citing\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226-27; State Dep\u2019t of Highways and Public Transp. v. Gonzalez, 82\n\nS.W.3d 322, 327 (Tex. 2002).\n\n       In determining whether a plaintiff has a valid claim under the TCHRA for either\n\ndiscrimination or unlawful retaliation, Texas courts recognize two alternative methods of proof.\n\nSee Williams-Pyro, Inc. v. Barbour, 408 S.W.3d 467, 477-79 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2013, pet.\n\ndenied), citing Mission Consol., 372 S.W.3d at 634.           First, a plaintiff may prove unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory or retaliatory intent via direct evidence. Williams-Pyro, Inc., 408 S.W.3d at 477-\n\n79. \u201cDirect evidence is evidence that, if believed, proves the fact of discriminatory animus\n\nwithout inference or presumption.\u201d Quantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, 47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex.\n\n2001). However, as courts have recognized, it is often difficult to prove \u201cforbidden animus\u201d\n\nthrough direct evidence. Id. (recognizing that \u201cmotives are often more covert than overt, making\n\ndirect evidence of forbidden animus hard to come by\u201d); see also Alamo Heights Indep. Sch. Dist.\n\nv. Clark, 544 S.W.3d 755, 782 (Tex. 2018) (recognizing that \u201csmoking guns are hard to come by\u201d\n\nin discrimination and unlawful retaliation cases).\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\f       Because of this, Texas courts have developed a second method of establishing a claim\n\nunder the TCHRA, which follows the burden-shifting mechanism described in McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973). That paradigm allows the plaintiff to\n\nestablish a case through circumstantial evidence.       See Alamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 782\n\n(applying McDonnell Douglas framework to unlawful retaliation cases). Under this method,\n\ncommonly referred to as the \u201cMcDonnell Douglas\u201d framework, the plaintiff must first come\n\nforward with sufficient jurisdictional evidence to establish a prima facie case on each element of\n\ntheir claim. See id. And if the plaintiff meets this burden, discrimination is presumed, and the\n\nburden then shifts to the employer to \u201carticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\n\nemployee\u2019s rejection.\u201d Madden v. El Paso Indep. Sch. Dist., 473 S.W.3d 355, 360 (Tex.App.--\n\nEl Paso 2015, no pet.), quoting Quantum Chem. Corp., 47 S.W.3d at 477. Once an employer\n\noffers an ostensibly legitimate reason for their actions, the presumption disappears, and \u201c[t]he\n\nburden then shifts back to the complainant to show that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext\n\nfor discrimination.\u201d Madden, 473 S.W.3d at 360, quoting Quantum Chem. Corp., 47 S.W.3d at\n\n477. To establish a fact question on the issue of pretext, the plaintiff must present evidence, which\n\nwhen viewed as a whole, would support a finding that the non-discriminatory reason given by the\n\nemployer was false or not credible, and that the \u201creal reason for the employment action was\n\nunlawful discrimination.\u201d Madden, 473 S.W.3d at 360-361.\n\n                              IV. GENDER DISCRIMINATION\n\n       To establish a prima facie case of gender based employment discrimination, Resendiz was\n\nrequired to plead and produce evidence (1) that he was a member of a class protected by the\n\nTCHRA, (2) that he was qualified for his employment position, (3) that he was terminated from\n\nhis employment, and (4) that he was replaced by someone outside his protected class after his\n\n\n                                                 7\n\ftermination. AutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, 272 S.W.3d 588, 592 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam). To satisfy\n\nthe fourth prong of the test, an employee may in some instances alternatively establish that he or\n\nshe was treated differently than similarly situated employees, also referred to as \u201ccomparators.\u201d\n\nSee, e.g., Remaley v. TA Operating LLC, 561 S.W.3d 675, 681 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2018, pet. denied) (recognizing that the fourth prong of the test will vary depending on the context\n\nof the plaintiff\u2019s employment claim); Acosta v. Gov\u2019t Employees Credit Union, 351 S.W.3d 637,\n\n641 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2011, no pet.) (recognizing that the precise requirements to establish a\n\nprima facie case vary depending on the allegations in each case, and in some instances an employee\n\nmay satisfy the fourth prong by producing evidence that she was treated differently than other\n\nsimilarly-situated employees).\n\n       The Department\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction attacked Resendiz\u2019s gender discrimination claim\n\nby first identifying each of the comparators that Resendiz had identified in discovery. The\n\nDepartment then attached an exhibit germane to each of those comparators that challenged whether\n\nany of them were ever charged with theft, or had the same chain of command. In that way, it\n\nchallenged whether any of these employees were in fact true comparators. Additionally, the\n\nDepartment identified the persons who replaced Resendiz, and attached some evidence that each\n\nof them were males, which negated that he was replaced with someone outside his protected class.\n\n       In his response to the plea below, Resendiz responded to the Department\u2019s arguments on\n\nnational origin, disability discrimination, retaliation, and sexual harassment.       He did not,\n\nhowever, make any specific response to the challenge on the gender discrimination claim. On\n\nappeal, the Department reasserts its challenge to the gender discrimination claim, again pointing\n\nto the evidence that Resendiz was replaced by only males, and the comparators were not really\n\ncomparators. And again, Resendiz does not address the challenge to the prima facie case on that\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\ftheory in his brief.2 Accordingly, the trial court would have erred in failing to dismiss the gender\n\ndiscrimination claim. We grant the Department\u2019s challenge to the extent it argues that Resendiz\n\nfails to make out a prima facie case for gender discrimination.\n\n         V. THE DEPARTMENT PROFFERED A NON-DISCRIMINATORY REASON FOR\n             HIS TERMINATION, WHICH RESENDIZ DOES NOT REBUT\n        Resendiz does not argue that he has direct evidence of discrimination for any of his several\n\ntheories.     As explained above, when a plaintiff is unable to present direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, he may instead produce evidence establishing a prima facie case of discrimination\n\nunder the McDonnell-Douglas framework. To establish a prima facie case of employment\n\ndiscrimination for his national origin claim, Resendiz was required to plead and produce evidence\n\n(1) that he was a member of a class protected by the TCHRA, (2) that he was qualified for his\n\nemployment position, (3) that he was terminated from his employment, and (4) that he was\n\nreplaced by someone outside his protected class after his termination (or was treated differently\n\nthan comparators). AutoZone, Inc., 272 S.W.3d at 592. Likewise for his disability claim, he\n\nmust show (1) the plaintiff has a disability, (2) he is qualified for the job, and (3) he suffered an\n\nadverse employment decision because of his disability. See El Paso County v. Vasquez, 508\n\nS.W.3d 626, 639 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2016, pet. denied), citing Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp.,\n\n101 F.3d 1090, 1092 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  It is unclear whether Resendiz is pursuing a claim of gender discrimination based on the substance of his pleadings\nand his brief on appeal. To the extent such a claim is made, Resendiz failed to meet his burden of presenting a prima\nfacie case. In his summary of his argument, Resendiz states that a \u201creasonable juror could find that Resendiz\u2019s age\nwas at least a factor in Appellant\u2019s action (emphasis supplied).\u201d However, his pleadings never asserted an age\ndiscrimination claim. And even to the extent that this was a mere typographical error, there is no substantive\nargument in the brief that responds to the Department\u2019s claim that the identified comparators were not really\ncomparators, or that Resendiz was replaced with only other male workers. See RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569\nS.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex. 2018) (\u201cA brief must provide citations or argument and analysis for the contentions and failure\nto do this can result in waiver.\u201d).\n\n                                                         9\n\f       And assuming that Resendiz met his burden for each of these claims, the Department then\n\ncarried the burden of production to show a non-discriminatory basis for its decision. Quantum\n\nChem. Corp., 47 S.W.3d at 477. If it does so, Resendiz then must prove that his disability or\n\nnational origin was a motivating factor in his termination. See Id. (once an employer offers an\n\nostensibly legitimate reason for its actions, the presumption of discrimination disappears, and the\n\nburden then shifts back to the employee to show that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext\n\nfor discrimination); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Canchola, 121 S.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003)\n\n(causation standard is motivating factor); Quantum Chem. Corp., 47 S.W.3d at 480.\n\n       While the Department contests whether Resendiz has met his burden to show a prima facie\n\ncase for the national origin and disability discrimination, we need not address those arguments.\n\nInstead, we conclude that the Department met its burden to demonstrate a non-discriminatory basis\n\nfor the termination--suspected theft of Department property--and Resendiz was then unable to\n\nshow that stated reason was a pretext for an discrimination.\n\n       A. The Department\u2019s Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason for the Termination\n\n       The Department\u2019s internal policy expressly states that employee theft is classified as a\n\n\u201cmajor offense,\u201d and \u201cmost likely will result in dismissal from employment[.]\u201d The Department\n\npresented evidence that Josefina Herrera suspected that employees were violating that policy by\n\ntaking patients\u2019 food after she found empty state-purchased juice boxes in the maintenance\n\nworkshop. To investigate that belief, she looked at video surveillance of the loading dock.\n\nVideo footage from February 27, 2014, showed Edgar Garcia taking a roll of floor vinyl out of the\n\nfacility and placing it near a dumpster. It also showed Resendiz take a can of adhesive out the\n\nsame door towards the dumpster. Later an unidentified car came by the dumpster. Internal\n\ninventory records show a missing role of floor vinyl and a missing can of adhesive.\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f       The surveillance footage further showed that on the day of the alleged theft, a delivery\n\ntruck arrived and a large amount of supplies and materials were unloaded and placed next to the\n\nloading dock door, including boxes of flooring and seven buckets of flooring adhesive. Both\n\nResendiz and Garcia admitted there was a delivery that day and that they were present at the time\n\nof the delivery. Later the same day, Garcia walked into the loading dock with Resendiz behind\n\nhim. Garcia pressed the button to open the loading dock door and Resendiz walked toward the\n\nloading dock door. Resendiz picked up a bucket that was located in the same area where the\n\nmaterials/supplies were delivered and placed earlier that day. Resendiz then exited through the\n\nloading dock door towards the direction of the dumpster outside with the bucket in his hand.\n\nResendiz walked back inside without the bucket in hand, and then both he and Garcia left the\n\nloading dock area. Frame by frame still shots captured from the same video surveillance were all\n\nincluded as exhibits to the Department\u2019s plea.\n\n       The Department\u2019s plea also documents that Hernandez, upon seeing these images, called\n\nin a state investigator who reviewed the surveillance footage, took statements, and reviewed the\n\ninventory records. The investigator concluded that the allegations of theft against both Garcia\n\nand Resendiz were substantiated, and he referred both matters for criminal prosecution.\n\nInformation gathered by the OIG investigator is all attached to the Department\u2019s plea, and includes\n\ninterview memorandums with fact witnesses, a case video memorandum, photos, invoices, and\n\nvideo surveillance of the loading dock area of the EPPC where the theft occurred.\n\n       On February 27, 2014, Resendiz was served with a notice setting out this allegation along\n\nwith a warning of the possible consequence of losing his job. The notice provided him an\n\nopportunity to respond. He declined, and the Department terminated his employment. This\n\nevidence is sufficient to state a non-discriminatory reason for the termination. Resendiz was then\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\ftasked with challenging that stated reason by showing it was a pretext for the discriminatory\n\nmotives that he asserts.\n\n       B. The Department\u2019s Reason for Termination was Sufficiently Stated\n\n       Resendiz first contends that the Department failed to offer a non-discriminatory basis for\n\nits decision, claiming that it only provided vague, \u201cnon-specific\u201d reasons for his termination, and\n\nthat its stated reasons were without any content that would \u201cafford [him] a realistic opportunity to\n\nshow that the reason is pretextual.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 61-62. He further contends that the\n\nDepartment\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction merely relied on the \u201cargument of counsel\u201d in articulating its\n\nreasons for his termination, and that the Department failed to present any evidence that it\n\nterminated him for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. We agree with Resendiz that an\n\nemployer\u2019s articulated reasons for the adverse termination decision must be sufficiently specific\n\nto give the employee the opportunity to present evidence establishing that the reasons were\n\npretextual. See, e.g., Patrick v. Ridge, 394 F.3d 311, 317 (5th Cir. 2004) (employer did not meet\n\nits burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for failing to promote an\n\nemployee, where it simply stated its opinion that the employee would not \u201cfit in\u201d and was not\n\n\u201csufficiently suited\u201d for the position). We disagree, however, that the Department failed to meet\n\nthis standard.\n\n       The Department clearly and expressly informed Resendiz that he was being terminated for\n\ntheft of Department property in the termination notice that was sent to him.           And, as the\n\nDepartment points out, its policy manual expressly states that theft of property is considered a\n\n\u201cmajor offense,\u201d which is a ground for an employee\u2019s termination. As well, the commission of a\n\nserious offense such as theft, which violates an employer\u2019s express policies, can be considered a\n\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for an employee\u2019s termination. See, e.g., Jones v. Overnite\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fTransp. Co., 212 Fed.App\u2019x 268, 274 (5th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (theft and conversion of\n\ncompany property upheld as legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for employee\u2019s termination);\n\nLund v. Texas Health & Human Services Comm\u2019n, No. 04-17-00625-CV, 2019 WL 1049347, at\n\n*2-4 (Tex.App.--San Antonio Mar. 6, 2019, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (employer articulated a\n\nlegitimate non-discriminatory reason for employee\u2019s termination based on an OIG investigation\n\nthat confirmed employee had violated its policies by, among other things, using a \u201cLone Star\n\nCard\u201d issued to her nephew for her own personal use without authority to do so).\n\n       Moreover, in its plea to the jurisdiction, the Department did not just rely on the arguments\n\nof its counsel in stating the reason for Resendiz\u2019s termination; instead, it attached supporting\n\nexhibits, including the termination notice it sent to Resendiz stating that he was being terminated\n\nfor theft, and the deposition testimony of at least three Department employees who all testified that\n\nResendiz was terminated for theft.\n\n       C. Resendiz Failed to Raise a Fact Question on the Issue of Pretext\n\n       Next, Resendiz sets forth multiple reasons why he believes the Department\u2019s stated reason\n\nfor terminating him was false and was a pretext for its alleged discriminatory animus. We address\n\neach of his arguments in turn.\n\n       First, Resendiz contends that the Department deviated from its usual policies when it\n\nterminated him without first engaging in \u201cprogressive discipline,\u201d and he argues that this alleged\n\ndeviation can be considered as evidence of pretext. See Cont\u2019l Coffee Products Co. v. Cazarez,\n\n937 S.W.2d 444, 451 (Tex. 1996) (treating failure to adhere to established company policies in\n\ncarrying out a challenged employment action as establishing a causal link between termination and\n\nemployee\u2019s exercise of a protected right). Although in some instances an employer\u2019s deviation\n\nfrom its standard policies or procedures in disciplining an employee can be considered evidence\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fof pretext, there is nothing in the record here to suggest that the Department deviated from its\n\nstandard policies or procedures when it terminated Resendiz. The Department\u2019s policy manual\n\nclearly states that theft is a \u201cmajor offense\u201d that is grounds for immediate dismissal, and there is\n\nnothing in the manual that would suggest the Department was required to engage in progressive\n\ndiscipline when an employee was accused of such an offense. In addition, at his deposition,\n\nOsterhout testified that although the Department may use progressive discipline in less \u201csevere\u201d\n\ncases of employee misconduct, the Department has the discretion to \u201cjump\u201d to termination when\n\nan employee is accused of a more serious offense such as theft. In fact, Osterhout testified that\n\nhe had never seen progressive discipline used in cases in which an employee was accused of\n\nstealing state resources.\n\n       Second, Resendiz finds evidence of pretext based on his contention that the Department\n\ntreated other employees differently than him in meting out, or failing to mete out discipline.\n\nAlthough discrimination can be found when an employer has treated an employee in a \u201cdisparate\u201d\n\nmanner in comparison to other employees, such a finding is only justified if the employees are\n\nsimilarly situated in all material respects. See Ysleta Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Monarrez, 177 S.W.3d\n\n915, 917-18 (Tex. 2005) (per curiam). Thus, to establish a discriminatory motive, the employees\n\nwho were allegedly treated more favorably than the plaintiff must have engaged in misconduct\n\nthat was \u201cnearly identical\u201d in seriousness to the plaintiff\u2019s misconduct. Id. Here, Resendiz relies\n\non the fact that the Department did not discipline other Department employees who failed to report\n\nthat they had observed the missing roll of vinyl left outside the loading dock, as Department policy\n\nrequired them to do. These employees, however, engaged in different misconduct that was of a\n\nless serious nature than theft. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the\n\nDepartment treated other employees who were accused of theft, or other similarly serious\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fmisconduct, more favorably than him. To the contrary, Osterhout testified that other Department\n\nemployees who had been accused of theft were also terminated and were therefore treated the same\n\nas Resendiz.\n\n         Third, Resendiz contends that the record contains discrepancies with respect to who were\n\nthe final decision-makers responsible for terminating him, and he alleges that the Department\u2019s\n\nSuperintendent, Zulema Carrillo, as well as Osterhout, and Herrera all claimed that each other, as\n\nwell as the Austin headquarters, made the final termination decision, and that none of them was\n\nwilling to take responsibility for the decision. 3 Such conflicting evidence and blame-shifting\n\ncould support a finding of pretext. See, e.g., Frierson v. Illinois Cmty. Coll. Dist. 525, No. 97 C\n\n6487, 2000 WL 283103, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 6, 2000) (pretext finding supported by conflicting\n\nstatements regarding who made the employment decision, and therefore no one who could truly\n\nadvance the reason for the termination, given that no one claimed responsibility for the action);\n\nChristensen v. Titan Distribution, Inc., 481 F.3d 1085, 1095 (8th Cir. 2007) (pretext finding\n\nsupported in part by evidence that decisionmakers were not willing to accept responsibility for\n\ndecision, but each blamed others).\n\n         However, the record does not support Resendiz\u2019s allegations, as there is nothing to suggest\n\nthat the Department\u2019s supervisory employees did not accept responsibility for the termination\n\ndecision, or that they were attempting to shift blame to each other, or to the Austin headquarters.\n\nTo the contrary, Carrillo, Herrera, and Osterhout all agreed that Resendiz\u2019s termination was made\n\nin accordance with the Department\u2019s usual multi-step process, which necessarily involved review\n\n\n3\n  Resendiz also contends that during their depositions, these three individuals gave differing reasons for his\ntermination In particular, Resendiz finds it significant that Osterhout testified that Resendiz was terminated based on\n\u201csuspicion of theft and losing State assets,\u201d while Carrillo and Herrera both testified that he was terminated due to\ntheft However, Osterhout made it clear that he believed Resendiz had committed a theft and had colluded with Garcia\nin doing so. We therefore do not find any inconsistencies in the Department\u2019s position that Resendiz was terminated\nfor theft.\n\n                                                         15\n\fand approval by more than one person and department. As both Herrera and Osterhout testified,\n\nafter reviewing the video footage pertaining to the missing property, they concluded that Resendiz\n\nwas responsible for theft of state property and referred the matter to the OIG. And, after being\n\ninformed that the OIG had substantiated that criminal activity had occurred, Osterhout\n\nrecommended Resendiz\u2019s termination, and as required by Department policy, that\n\nrecommendation was reviewed by both Carrillo, as the Center\u2019s superintendent, as well as by the\n\nlegal department at the Austin headquarters.4 And in turn, there is no dispute that after obtaining\n\napproval from both Carrillo and the legal department, both Osterhout and Herrera signed the final\n\ntermination notice, and accepted full responsibility for doing so.\n\n         Fourth, Resendiz seeks to establish pretext by arguing that the termination notice itself\n\ncontained \u201cfalse\u201d information. In particular, Resendiz finds it significant that the termination\n\nnotice stated that the \u201c[a]fter reviewing the recordings and conducting interviews, the OIG\n\ninvestigator decided to proceed with filing theft charges for a roll of vinyl and a can of adhesive\n\nvalued at over $1,500.\u201d Resendiz points out that the OIG investigator did not make his final\n\nrecommendation until March of 2014, yet the termination notice referring to the OIG\u2019s findings\n\nwas dated February 28, 2014. Resendiz further contends that when the Department made the\n\ndecision to terminate him, \u201cOsterhout, Carrillo, and Herrera did not know what any witnesses saw,\n\nwhat evidence there was that Resendiz committed theft, or what OIG had found.\u201d Appellee\u2019s\n\nBrief at p. 68. This, however, is not an accurate summary of the facts.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Contrary to Resendiz\u2019s argument, none of the employees involved attempted to shift any blame to the Austin\nHeadquarters\u2019 office for making the final termination decision, as they made it clear in their deposition testimony that\nthe termination recommendation was sent to the legal department for review and guidance only. In addition, although\nOsterhout testified that he believed Carrillo was a final decision-maker, it is unclear whether he meant that she had\nveto power over the final decision, or whether she was in fact considered a true decision-maker.\n\n                                                          16\n\f         As the Department points out, the OIG investigator informed both Carrillo and Osterhout\n\nby e-mail dated February 19, 2014, that he had completed his preliminary interviews with respect\n\nto the theft allegation against Resendiz, and that he had found \u201cevidence of criminal activity,\u201d and\n\nthat the Department could address Resendiz\u2019s employment status at its discretion. In addition,\n\nOsterhout testified that prior to sending the termination notice, he had a verbal conversation with\n\nthe OIG investigator in which the investigator told him that he intended to file charges against\n\nResendiz \u201cfor theft for over $1,500.\u201d Therefore, although admittedly none of the individuals\n\ninvolved had received an actual copy of the OIG\u2019s report at the time the termination decision was\n\nmade, the record clearly indicates that the Department was aware of the investigator\u2019s preliminary\n\nfindings at the time of the termination. 5 And, as the Department points out, there is nothing in\n\nthe record to suggest that the Department was required to wait until the OIG issued its final report\n\nbefore it could terminate Resendiz, or that it was even required to submit the matter to the OIG\n\nbefore making the termination decision. Moreover, both Osterhout and Herrera had reviewed the\n\nvideo footage related to the alleged theft before the OIG investigation began, and they had both\n\nindependently concluded that Resendiz has stolen State property.\n\n         Fifth, Resendiz contends that the video could not have been made on January 17, 2014.\n\nAt his deposition, however, Resendiz was shown the video, and although he disputed the accuracy\n\nof the time on the video, he did not dispute that the video showed what it showed. That is, he\n\nacknowledged the video showed the loading dock area, that there a large delivery of supplies that\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Resendiz also finds it significant that in the termination notice, the Department stated that the OIG had investigated\nhim for stealing both the vinyl and the adhesive, when in fact the OIG had only investigated him for stealing the\nadhesive. However, at the time the termination notice was sent, Osterhout was unaware that the investigator was\nonly investigating Resendiz for stealing the adhesive and not the vinyl and Osterhout himself believed based on his\nown review of the evidence that Resendiz had colluded with Garcia to steal both items.\n\n                                                          17\n\fday, that Garcia removed the roll of vinyl out the back door, and that he is shown removing a\n\ncontainer of adhesive out the back door.\n\n       Sixth and finally, Resendiz contends that the Department and the OIG investigator did not\n\nconduct a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of the theft allegations, contending that they failed to verify\n\ncertain details regarding the theft and failed to conduct a formal inventory of missing items after\n\nthe alleged theft took place. Even if there were errors in the investigation, or it was not as\n\nthorough as Resendiz would have liked, this does not, standing alone, establish that the\n\nDepartment\u2019s reasons for terminating him were pretextual. See Davis v. Farmers Ins. Exch.,\n\nNo. 4:08-CV-625-A, 2009 WL 1065159, at *7 (N.D. Tex. 2009), aff\u2019d, 372 Fed.App\u2019x 517\n\n(5th Cir. 2010) (contention that employer did not conduct a sufficiently thorough investigation into\n\nallegation that employee took gifts from employer\u2019s vendors in violation of employer\u2019s policy did\n\nnot support a finding of pretext). In determining whether an employer\u2019s stated reasons for an\n\nadverse termination decision were pretextual, the focus is not on whether the decision itself was\n\nerror-free, but on whether the employer relied on its stated reasons, in good faith, in making the\n\nemployment decision. See Waggoner v. City of Garland, Texas, 987 F.2d 1160, 1165-66 (5th Cir.\n\n1993) (the focus is on whether the employer\u2019s perceptions--whether accurate or not--were the real\n\nreason for the adverse action rather than a pretext to cover up its discriminatory animus); see also\n\nAlamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 792 (recognizing that the issue is \u201cwhether the employer\u2019s\n\nperception of the [employee\u2019s] problems--accurate or not--was the real reason for termination.\u201d).\n\n       Accordingly, we conclude, even if we assume Resendiz met his prima facie burden for\n\nnational origin discrimination, or that he evidenced a disability under the TCHRA, or even made\n\nout a valid gender discrimination claim, the Department set forth a legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreason for Resendiz\u2019s termination, and Resendiz failed to present any evidence that the Department\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fwas not acting in good faith in relying on that reason. We therefore conclude that Resendiz has\n\nfailed to raise a fact question on the issue of pretext.\n\n         The Department\u2019s Issue as it pertains to the national origin, and disability claim is\n\nsustained.\n\n                                                VI. RETALIATION\n\n         Resendiz concedes that he has no direct evidence that the Center had a retaliatory motive\n\nfor terminating him, and therefore, our question whether he has come forward with sufficient\n\nevidence to support a prima facie case of retaliation under TCHRA, in accordance with the\n\nMcDonnel-Douglas burden shifting framework set forth above. For the reasons set forth below,\n\nwe conclude that he has not met this burden.\n\n         A The Elements of a Retaliation Claim\n\n         The THCRA prohibits an employer from engaging in retaliation against an employee for\n\nopposing a discriminatory practice.6 See Waffle House, Inc. v. Williams, 313 S.W.3d 796, 804,\n\n(Tex. 2010), citing TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.051, .055(1); see also County of El Paso v. Aguilar,\n\n600 S.W.3d 62, 82-83 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2020, no pet.) (\u201cThe TCHRA prohibits an employer\n\nfrom retaliating against an employee for engaging in protected activity such as opposing a\n\ndiscriminatory practice or making a charge of discrimination.\u201d). \u201cTo establish a prima facie case\n\nof retaliation, an employee must show: (1) [he] engaged in an activity protected by the TCHRA,\n\n(2) [he] experienced a material adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link exists between\n\nthe protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d Texas Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Lara, 625 S.W.3d 46,\n\n\n6\n  \u201cAn employer, labor union, or employment agency commits an unlawful employment practice if the employer, labor\nunion, or employment agency retaliates or discriminates against a person who, under this chapter: (1) opposes a\ndiscriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files a complaint; or (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any\nmanner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing.\u201d TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.055. Resendiz only claims that he\nopposed a discriminatory practice and does not claim that he filed a charge or complaint against Herrera or that he\ntestified or participated in any proceedings against her prior to his termination.\n\n                                                             19\n\f58 (Tex. 2021), quoting Alamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 782. A retaliation claim is related to, but\n\ndistinct from, a discrimination claim, and one may be viable even when the other is not. Alamo\n\nHeights, 544 S.W.3d at 763-64, 781. Unlike a discrimination claim, a retaliation claim focuses on\n\nthe employer\u2019s response to an employee\u2019s protected activity, such as making a discrimination\n\ncomplaint, rather than on the validity of the underlying discrimination complaint. Id. Thus, the\n\nplaintiff need not establish that the reported discrimination occurred to support a claim for\n\nretaliation and need only establish that he had a good faith and reasonable belief that the\n\ndiscrimination occurred when he made his report. See Houston Methodist San Jacinto Hosp. v.\n\nFord, 483 S.W.3d 588, 592 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, pet. denied) (employee has the\n\nburden to \u201cdemonstrate a good-faith, reasonable belief that the underlying discriminatory practice\n\nviolated the TCHRA.\u201d). In other words, \u201c[o]pposition to a discriminatory practice is a protected\n\nactivity irrespective of the merits of the underlying discrimination claim.\u201d City of Waco v. Lopez,\n\n259 S.W.3d 147, 151 (Tex. 2008).\n\n        B. Whether Resendiz Engaged in Protected Activity\n\n        Resendiz\u2019s termination is an adverse employment decision, but what is missing from the\n\nrecord is any evidence that he engaged in any protected activity or that he was terminated as the\n\nresult thereof.\n\n                  1. No evidence that Resendiz complained of sexual harassment\n\n        The evidence indicates Resendiz complained generally about Herrera\u2019s treatment of him,\n\nbut there is no evidence that the complaints involved allegations of sexual harassment. In\n\ncontrast, his interrogatory responses unequivocally state he did not make any complaints regarding\n\nsexual harassment. For these reasons, we find there is no evidence that he complained of sexual\n\nharassment.\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f                 2. No evidence that Resendiz complained of disability discrimination\n\n        Resendiz testified that he was diagnosed with high blood pressure in either 2008 or 2010.\n\nHowever, he alleges that Herrera did not begin making comments to him about his high blood\n\npressure until after he requested to take ten days off from work sometime in 2013, after he became\n\ndizzy and lost his balance at work due to his high blood pressure. And, although he initially\n\nalleged that this request was made in either March or August of 2013, the written documentation\n\nof his absence unequivocally establishes that his ten-day leave took place from October 28 to\n\nNovember 7, 2013.\n\n        But Resendiz provided no evidence that he complained to Carrillo or any other\n\nmanagement personnel that he believed Herrera was mistreating him due to his alleged disability.\n\nIn his response to the Center\u2019s interrogatories, Resendiz only alleged that he complained to Carrillo\n\nand human resources about Herrera\u2019s alleged \u201congoing harassment\u201d of him, not that Herrera was\n\ndiscriminating against him because of high blood pressure.7 Moreover, his deposition testimony\n\nwas similarly vague, with no indication that he made any specific complaints of disability\n\ndiscrimination to Carrillo or that he even informed her of his alleged disability. And although\n\nCarrillo recalled that Resendiz complained to him of Herrera\u2019s alleged mistreatment, she did not\n\nrecall Resendiz telling her that he believed Herrera had a discriminatory motive for mistreating\n\nhim, or that he mentioned his high blood pressure issues in his complaint.\n\n        We therefore conclude that Resendiz failed to establish that he reported any unlawful\n\ndisability discrimination to Carrillo or anyone else at the Center.\n\n\n7\n  In his supplemental answers to the Department\u2019s interrogatories, Resendiz stated that he did not complain about\nHerrera\u2019s alleged sexual harassment because his \u201ccomplaints regarding his disability were disregarded.\u201d However,\nthis is the only reference Resendiz made to any such disability complaints, and he did not provide any indication of\nwhen or how these complaints were made or to whom they were made, nor does he elaborate on the content of the\ncomplaints in question. We therefore find this general reference to a disability complaint too vague to support his\nallegation that he reported his alleged disability to anyone at the Center.\n\n                                                        21\n\f               3. Resendiz\u2019s leave request did not constitute a protected activity\n\n       Resendiz argues that his request for a ten-day absence from work can be considered a\n\nrequest for a reasonable accommodation under TCHRA, which in turn he contends can be\n\nconsidered a \u201cprotected activity.\u201d And Resendiz further contends that because he was terminated\n\nshortly after he made his leave request, this timing would allow a jury to reasonably infer that his\n\ntermination came in retaliation for making his request. We disagree.\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court recently addressed a similar issue in Lara. In that case, a state\n\nemployee who had suffered a catastrophic illness, exhausted his sick leave, and thereafter filed\n\npaperwork requesting benefits under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and the State\u2019s sick\n\nleave pool. 625 S.W.3d at 49. Over the course of approximately five months, at various times,\n\nthe employee received paid leave through the sick leave pool, as well as unpaid leave under the\n\nFMLA. Id. In addition, during that time, the employee had multiple communications with his\n\nsupervisors, making it clear that he was seeking leave to receive medical treatment for his\n\ncondition, which would in turn, enable him to return to work within a specified period of time.\n\nId. at 49-50. However, after he made his second request to extend his leave, his employer notified\n\nhim that it was terminating him so that it could hire a full-time employee to perform his job duties.\n\nId. at 49 Upon being terminated, the employee filed suit against the employer, arguing that his\n\nleave request could be considered a request for a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d under TCHRA, and\n\nthat the employer had terminated him in retaliation for making the request, in violation of\n\nTCHRA\u2019s anti-retaliation provisions. Id. at 50.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, the court agreed with the employee that requesting leave without\n\npay could constitute a request for a reasonable accommodation under TCHRA. Id. at 55. In\n\nparticular, the court noted that a request for a reasonable accommodation need not be formal in\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fnature, need not mention discrimination laws, or use the term, \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d Id.\n\nInstead, the court held that the employee was only required to \u201clet the employer know that [the\n\nemployee] needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to medical condition.\u201d Id.\n\nat 53. And the court concluded that by submitting evidence of his multiple leave requests and his\n\ncommunications with his supervisors regarding his medical condition and desire to return to work\n\nonce his treatment was completed, he had raised a question of fact regarding whether his request\n\nfor leave without pay constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation under TCHRA.\n\nId. at 54.\n\n        However, the court concluded that the employee had not made out a prima facie case that\n\nhe was terminated in retaliation for making that request. Id. at 59-60. The court expressly held\n\nthat to invoke the anti-retaliation protections under TCHRA, the employee\u2019s request for an\n\naccommodation must alert the employer to his belief that \u201cdisability discrimination was at issue,\u201d\n\nor in other words, that the accommodation request was made to oppose a discriminatory practice\n\nof that nature. Id. at 59-60. The employee in Lara argued that his various leave requests, as well\n\nas his ongoing communications with his supervisors discussing his requests, alerted the employer\n\nthat he was opposing a discriminatory practice based on his disability. Id. at 60. However, the\n\ncourt disagreed, pointing out that there was no evidence that the employee had alerted the\n\nemployee \u201cto the possibility of discrimination in any of these communications.\u201d Id. at 61.\n\n        We reach a similar conclusion in the present case. Resendiz did far less than the employee\n\nin Lara did in terms of letting the Center know that he needed an \u201cadjustment or change at work\n\nfor a reason related to medical condition.\u201d Id. at 53. As set forth above, Resendiz made a single\n\nrequest for a ten-day leave of absence, after he became dizzy and lost his balance at work due to\n\nhis high blood pressure, and upon his return, he submitted a \u201creturn to work\u201d note from his doctor,\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fas requested by the Center in accordance with its policies, stating that his absence had been\n\nnecessary due to his high blood pressure. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Resendiz\n\nalerted the Center that he needed the time off work to obtain medical treatment for his condition\n\nthat would allow him to continue performing his job, or that he had any other communications\n\nwith the Center\u2019s management seeking an \u201cadjustment or change\u201d of his work schedule due to his\n\ncondition. We therefore question whether his leave request could in fact be considered a request\n\nfor a reasonable accommodation under TCHRA. See Aldine Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Massey, No. 01-\n\n17-00688-CV, 2018 WL 3117831, at *4 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] June 26, 2018, no pet.)\n\n(recognizing that employee is responsible for initiating a request for a reasonable accommodation\n\nby pointing out his disability and requesting what he believes would constitute a reasonable\n\naccommodation that would allow him to continue performing his job); E.E.O.C. v. Chevron\n\nPhillips Chem. Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606, 620 (5th Cir. 2009) (explaining that it is employee\u2019s\n\nresponsibility to inform employer that he seeks an accommodation and to explain that the\n\naccommodation requested is for a medical condition to allow the employee to continue performing\n\nhis job).\n\n        Nevertheless, even if Resendiz\u2019s leave request could be considered a valid request for a\n\nreasonable accommodation under TCHRA, it cannot be considered \u201cprotected activity\u201d under the\n\nTCHRA. As in Lara, there is no evidence in the record that Resendiz alerted the Center--either\n\nin the leave request itself or in any other communications he had with his supervisors-- that he was\n\nmaking the request as a means of opposing a discriminatory practice, or that he otherwise put the\n\nCenter on notice that disability discrimination was \u201cat issue.\u201d Therefore, as in Lara, there is\n\nnothing in the record to support a finding that Resendiz\u2019s leave request could be considered\n\n\u201cprotected activity\u201d under the TCHRA.\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f               4. National origin discrimination\n\n       Resendiz alleged in his EEOC complaint that in March of 2013, Herrera became \u201copenly\n\nhostile\u201d toward him because he did not speak English and began making \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d to\n\nhim and other non-English speakers, such as, \u201cDo you not have a brain? or \u201cCan\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nwhen other people were present. He further alleged that he complained to \u201cmanagement that this\n\ntreatment was not proper\u201d but that nothing was done. He then specified later in his complaint that\n\nin \u201cAugust 2013, [he] and other co-workers, complained to Zulema Carrillo, supervisor, regarding\n\nthe treatment we were receiving from Josie Herrera,\u201d but that again, no action was taken. And he\n\nfurther alleged that he called to complain to human resources in Austin and was told he had to\n\ncomplain locally. He asserted, however, that he advised them he had already \u201ctalked to\n\nmanagement locally and they didn\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\n       Resendiz provided little more information about his alleged complaints to management in\n\neither his answers to the Center\u2019s interrogatories or in his deposition testimony. In answer to the\n\nCenter\u2019s interrogatory question in which he was asked to identify \u201ceach and every instance in\n\nwhich [he] complained about any kind of discrimination forming the basis of this lawsuit during\n\n[his] employment,\u201d Resendiz responded that he could not recall the dates on which he did so, but\n\nthat he orally complained to Carrillo \u201cabout Josie Herrera\u2019s ongoing harassment.\u201d He further\n\nalleged that he called the \u201cAustin office to complain and was referred back to the El Paso office.\u201d\n\n       Although making a verbal report of discrimination to an employer may qualify as engaging\n\nin protected activity, a plaintiff must present some evidence to establish that he did more than\n\n\u201cmerely complain[] to the employer about [his] treatment.\u201d Esparza v. Univ. of Texas at El Paso,\n\n471 S.W.3d 903, 914 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2015, no pet.). At best, Resendiz\u2019s claim that Herrera\n\ncalled him a Mexican and scolded him and others at the Center in English when they only spoke\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\fSpanish, could signal national origin discrimination. But as to these complaints, he fails to present\n\nsufficient evidence that they caused his termination.\n\n       C. No Evidence of Causation\n\n       Even if we were to assume for purposes of this appeal that Resendiz came forward with\n\nsufficient circumstantial evidence to meet his burden of establishing a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, as with the National Origin and disability discrimination claims, the record does not\n\nsupport a finding that he was terminated on that basis. Once an employer offers an ostensibly\n\nlegitimate reason for its actions, the presumption of discrimination disappears, and the burden then\n\nshifts back to the employee to show that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination. Quantum Chem. Corp., 47 S.W.3d at 477; see also Madden, 473 S.W.3d at 360.\n\n       Two causation standards are at play in retaliation claims, the more onerous when the\n\nemployer has evidenced a non-discriminatory basis for the employment action:\n\n       The causation standard for the McDonnell Douglas prima-facie-case element is not\n       onerous and can be satisfied merely by proving close timing between the protected\n       activity and the adverse action. However, if the employer provides evidence of a\n       legitimate reason for the adverse action, under the federal standard, the employee\n       must prove the adverse action would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d the protected\n       activity. The but-for causation standard is significantly more difficult to prove\n       than prima facie causation.\n\nAlamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 782 (footnotes omitted). The \u201cbut for\u201d standard was recently\n\nreaffirmed in a retaliation case by the court in Apache Corp. v. Davis, 627 S.W.3d 324, 336-337\n\n(Tex. 2021).\n\n       In Alamo Heights, the court identified a series of factors useful in analyzing the causal link:\n\n       In evaluating but-for causation evidence in retaliation cases, we examine all of the\n       circumstances, including temporal proximity between the protected activity and the\n       adverse action, knowledge of the protected activity, expression of a negative\n       attitude toward the employee\u2019s protected activity, failure to adhere to relevant\n       established company policies, discriminatory treatment in comparison to similarly\n       situated employees, and evidence the employer\u2019s stated reason is false.\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f544 S.W.3d at 790. And more recently in Apache Corp. v. Davis, the court emphasized that the\n\n\u201cfactors\u201d are not a replacement for the \u201cbut for\u201d causation standard.          627 S.W.3d at 336.\n\nMoreover, \u201c[t]he factors may be more helpful in some cases and less in others. Some of the\n\nfactors may actually be a distraction.\u201d Id. \u201cMore importantly, determining but-for causation\n\ncannot be a matter of weighing\u2014or worse, counting\u2014factors that may be helpful in analyzing\n\ncircumstantial evidence in some situations.\u201d Id. at 337. Rather, our focus must be on whether\n\n\u201cbut for\u201d the protected activity, the termination would not have occurred when it did.\n\n       Without restating all the evidence regarding the theft claim, we conclude that the\n\nDepartment came forward with a record demonstrating a non-discriminatory basis for the\n\ntermination, and that Resendiz failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on pretext. He\n\nnecessarily fails to carry his burden on but for causation on the retaliation claim.\n\n                                 VII. SEXUAL HARASSMENT\n\n       In Issue Four, the Department contends that the trial court erred in denying its plea to the\n\njurisdiction with respect to Resendiz\u2019s claim of sexual harassment, contending that Resendiz did\n\nnot present sufficient jurisdictional evidence to establish his claim. As explained below, we agree\n\nwith the Department that Resendiz did not present any evidence to support a quid pro quo form of\n\nsexual harassment, but that he did come forward with sufficient evidence to support a claim of\n\nsexual harassment based on a hostile work environment.\n\n       A. The Elements of a Sexual Harassment Claim\n\n       Sexual harassment is a form of sex-based discrimination that is prohibited under TCHRA.\n\nSee Alamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 771; see also B.C. v. Steak N Shake Operations, Inc., 512\n\nS.W.3d 276, 279 (Tex. 2017). Sexual harassment claims generally take one of two forms: \u201c(1)\n\nquid-pro-quo harassment, in which the harasser demands sexual favors as a condition for granting\n\n\n                                                 27\n\femployment or its benefits, or (2) harassment that creates a hostile or offensive work\n\nenvironment.\u201d Alamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 806; Mayfield v. Tarrant Reg\u2019l Water Dist., 467\n\nS.W.3d 706, 712 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2015, no pet.). Here, Resendiz relies upon both theories to\n\nsupport his sexual harassment claim, and we therefore consider both in our analysis.\n\n       B. No Evidence of Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment\n\n       To establish a prima facie case for quid pro quo sexual harassment, a plaintiff must show\n\nthat: (1) he is a member of a protected group; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome sexual advances\n\nor requests for sexual favors by someone with actual or apparent authority; (3) the harassment was\n\nbased on sex; and (4) submission to the unwelcome advances was an express or implied condition\n\nfor receiving job benefits or refusal to submit resulted in a tangible job detriment. Mayfield, 467\n\nS.W.3d at 712; see also Alamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 806 (recognizing that quid pro quo\n\nharassment requires a showing that the \u201charasser demands sexual favors as a condition for granting\n\nemployment or its benefits.\u201d). Here, Resendiz testified to several incidents in which he believed\n\nthat Herrera subjected him to unwanted sexual advances. Yet he never alleged that her advances\n\nwere an express or implied condition for receiving job benefits or that his refusal to submit to the\n\nadvances would result in a tangible job detriment. Nor did he provide any evidence of such. To\n\nthe contrary, Resendiz testified at his deposition that Herrera never said that he was required to\n\ncomply with her advances toward him to get a promotion or a raise. In addition, in his response\n\nto the Department\u2019s interrogatories, when asked to explain how Herrera\u2019s alleged sexual\n\nharassment affected \u201cany term, condition or privilege\u201d or his employment, Resendiz responded\n\nonly that her treatment made him uncomfortable, and made it difficult for him to work. He did\n\nnot, however, provide any evidence that Herrera required him to submit to the advances as a\n\ncondition of his employment, or that she would threaten to take any negative action against him if\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fhe did not submit to her advances. Accordingly, we agree with the Department that Resendiz\n\nfailed to raise a question of fact on his claim for quid pro quo sexual harassment.\n\n       C. Resendiz\u2019s Evidence of a Hostile Work Environment\n\n       We next consider whether Resendiz came forward with evidence to raise a factual question\n\nregarding whether Herrera\u2019s alleged sexual harassment created a hostile work environment. We\n\nconclude that he did.\n\n               1. The elements of a hostile work environment claim\n\n       To make a prima facie showing of hostile environment sexual harassment based on a\n\nhostile work environment, the plaintiff must show (1) he was subjected to unwelcome sexual\n\nharassment, (2) he was harassed because of his sex, (3) the harassment was so severe or pervasive\n\nas to alter the conditions of employment and create a hostile work environment, and (4) some basis\n\nfor holding the employer liable. Alamo Heights, 544 S.W.3d at 771. For an employer\u2019s conduct\n\nto rise to the level of a hostile work environment, it must be both objectively and subjectively\n\nhostile or abusive, or in other words, the work environment must be both one that a reasonable\n\nperson would find hostile or abusive and one that the victim in fact perceived it to be. See Texas\n\nDep\u2019t of Aging and Disability Services v. Loya, 491 S.W.3d 920, 926 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2016,\n\nno pet.) citing Mayfield, 467 S.W.3d at 712-13; see also Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17,\n\n21-22 (1993). In assessing objective hostility or abusiveness, we consider the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, including the frequency and severity of the alleged conduct, whether there were\n\nphysical threats or humiliation, and whether the abusive conduct unreasonably interfered with the\n\nemployee\u2019s work performance. See Loya, 491 S.W.3d at 926 citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.\n\nAlthough the plaintiff need not demonstrate that the conduct caused him a \u201ctangible psychological\n\ninjury,\u201d he must demonstrate that it was more than \u201cmerely offensive.\u201d Mayfield, 467 S.W.3d at\n\n\n                                                29\n\f713 (\u201c[a]busiveness requires extreme conduct, and takes a middle path between making actionable\n\nconduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological\n\ninjury.\u201d); see also Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Gonzales, 72 S.W.3d 398, 407 (Tex.App.--El Paso\n\n2002, pet. denied) (tangible psychological injury such as a nervous breakdown is not required to\n\nsupport a harassment claim).\n\n       Once a court concludes that a plaintiff has met his burden of establishing a prima facie of\n\nsexual harassment based on a hostile work environment, there is no need to engage in a\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas burden shifting analysis. See, e.g., Matthews v. Corning, Inc., 77 F.Supp.3d\n\n275, 292 (W.D.N.Y. 2014) (\u201chostile work environment claims are not analyzed using the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas three-part burden-shifting test\u201d). Unlike situations in which a plaintiff has\n\nbrought a discrimination claim over an adverse employment action, a plaintiff alleging a hostile\n\nwork environment is complaining about the harassment itself and the damages that he suffered as\n\nthe result of the harassment. See Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broadcasting Service, Inc.,\n\n234 F.3d 501, 510-511 (11th Cir. 2000). And, as other courts have recognized, there \u201csimply is\n\nno legitimate business justification for severe or pervasive sexual harassment,\u201d and therefore it\n\nwould be illogical and unwarranted to go through the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting analysis\n\nin a hostile work environment case. Lewis v. Forest Pharm., Inc., 217 F.Supp. 2d 638, 653\n\n(D. Md. 2002).\n\n               2. Resendiz\u2019s testimony supports a prima facie case of hostile work environment\n\n       At his deposition, Resendiz testified to the following incidents involving Herrera that he\n\nfound offensive: (1) Herrera kept her work keys \u201cinside her breasts\u201d and when she would take\n\nthem out in front of him, she would say that the keys were \u201cwarm,\u201d and she would laugh about it;\n\n(2) Herrera told Resendiz that he was her boyfriend, and that other people were saying that he was\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\fher boyfriend; (3) Herrera would on unspecified occasions turn around as she was going up stairs\n\nto \u201clook at [his] private parts\u201d; (4) on one occasion, Herrera made him pull down his pants to show\n\nhim a scratch that he had suffered on his leg playing soccer when he complained that his injury\n\nwas making it difficult for him to work; (5) Herrera touched him \u201cmany times,\u201d and when she\n\ntouched his legs, she would complement him, saying such things, as \u201cMan, you have good legs\u201d;\n\n(6) when they were in her office behind closed doors, Herrera would on \u201cmany occasions\u201d\n\nunbutton her blouse all the way down, \u201cshowing her breasts,\u201d and would \u201copen her legs,\u201d showing\n\nhim \u201ceverything.\u201d And in his response to the Department\u2019s interrogatories, Resendiz added that\n\nHerrera would on occasion \u201crub her chest on his shoulders,\u201d make \u201cdisrespectful comments about\n\nhis buttocks and thighs,\u201d would laugh when \u201cpeople thought they were together,\u201d and made\n\ncomments that she and her husband could not have sex because of his kidney issues.\n\n       The Department contends that even if a jury believed Resendiz\u2019s testimony, it does not\n\nsupport a finding that Herrera\u2019s alleged conduct was so severe or pervasive that a reasonable\n\nperson would have found it to be hostile or abusive. In support of its position, the Department\n\ncites to Garcia v. Schwab, 967 S.W.2d 883, 884, 887 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1998, no pet.),\n\ncontending that the employer\u2019s conduct in that case was a far worse example of sexual harassment,\n\nand that Herrera\u2019s alleged misconduct was merely offensive in comparison. The Department\u2019s\n\nreliance on Garcia, however, is misplaced. In that case, a male supervisor stared at and made\n\ncomments about a female employee\u2019s breasts, remarked on her appearance, commented on the\n\nappearance of other women, touched his genitals in front of her, discussed personal sexual matters\n\nwith her, made sexual references that she felt were intended to arouse her, and generally insulted\n\nand yelled at her.    Id. at 887.    As set forth above, Resendiz also alleged that Herrera\n\ninappropriately stared at his private parts, remarked on his anatomy, discussed sexual matters\n\n\n\n                                                31\n\finvolving her husband, and similarly insulted and demeaned him. However, he also alleged much\n\nworse conduct, claiming that Herrera repeatedly exposed herself to him and engaged in unwanted\n\nand suggestive touching. Here, Resendiz presents a triable issue of fact as to whether Herrera\u2019s\n\nconduct was severe, pervasive, and extreme in nature. See Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., 72 S.W.3d\n\nat 408      (jury could reasonably conclude that employee was subjected to a hostile work\n\nenvironment where employee testified that his immediate supervisor pressed up against him so\n\nthat he could feel the supervisor\u2019s penis on \u201cmany occasions,\u201d offered to stick his tongue in the\n\nemployee\u2019s mouth, and \u201cstroked, rubbed and patted\u201d employee in a caressing manner).\n\n         The Department also contends that even if Herrera\u2019s alleged conduct could be considered\n\nsevere and extreme, Resendiz did not present sufficient evidence to establish that her conduct\n\naltered or interfered with his work performance. We disagree. Resendiz presented evidence that\n\nduring his last year of work at the Center, Herrera\u2019s alleged harassment made his work \u201cdifficult,\u201d\n\ncaused him stress, contributed to his high blood pressure, and caused him to miss work.8 Unlike\n\nquid pro quo harassment, in which a plaintiff must demonstrate that an employer explicitly altered\n\nthe terms, conditions or privileges of his employment, when a plaintiff proceeds on a theory of\n\nharassment culminating in a hostile work environment, it is the severe and extreme nature of the\n\nharassment itself that is said to \u201cconstructively alter the employee\u2019s terms or conditions of\n\nemployment.\u201d        Waffle House, Inc., 313 S.W.3d at 806-07.                   We therefore find Resendiz\u2019s\n\nevidence in this regard to be sufficient to support his claim.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  The Department also complains that Resendiz \u201ccannot properly self-diagnose himself with a medical condition or\nrender an expert medical opinion as to causation for his hypertension.\u201d The record, however, contains Resendiz\u2019s\ndoctor\u2019s note dated November 7, 2013, stating that Resendiz had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, and that\nhis condition was \u201cpermanent.\u201d In addition, although Resendiz did not present any expert testimony to establish that\nhis high blood pressure was caused by the stress of his work environment, the Department has not cited to any authority\nthat he was required to do so at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n                                                         32\n\f         And finally, the Department finds it significant that Resendiz did not complain to\n\n\u201cmanagement\u201d at the Center that Herrera was harassing him, and the Department contends that\n\nthere is therefore no basis for holding it liable. We disagree. In general, when a plaintiff seeks\n\nto hold an employer liable for harassment, there must be some evidence that the employer knew\n\nor should have known of the harassment, which can take the form of a complaint to management.\n\nHowever, when, as here, the employee claims that it was his supervisor that engaged in the alleged\n\nharassment, this is sufficient to support a finding that the employer was aware of the harassment,\n\nand the employee therefore need not present evidence that he filed any complaints about the\n\nsupervisor\u2019s conduct.     See, e.g., Nairn v. Killeen Indep. Sch. Dist., 366 S.W.3d 229, 245\n\n(Tex.App.--El Paso 2012, no pet.); see also Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., 72 S.W.3d at 407-08 (when\n\nemployee claims that his supervisor engaged in sexual harassment, employee need only show that\n\nthe supervisor subjected him to unwelcome conduct because of sex, which was so severe and\n\npervasive that it created an abusive work environment that affected a term, condition, or privilege\n\nof employment).\n\n         Accordingly, having found that Resendiz has presented sufficient evidence to support a\n\nprima facie case of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment, we conclude that the\n\ntrial court did not err in denying the Department\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction with respect to this claim.\n\n         The Department\u2019s Issue is therefore sustained in part, and overruled in part, as set forth\n\nabove.\n\n                                      VIII. CONCLUSION\n\n         We conclude that Resendiz failed to come forward to establish a prima facie case on his\n\nclaims of gender and retaliation claims. He failed to create a genuine issue of material fact\n\ncontesting the Department\u2019s stated non-discriminatory basis for terminating him, which negates\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fhis national origin discrimination and disability discrimination claims, in addition to his gender\n\nand retaliation claim. The trial court erred in denying the Department\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction as\n\nto those claims. Further, we conclude that Resendiz did not come forward with a scintilla of\n\nevidence to support his claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment, and that the trial court therefore\n\nalso erred in denying the Department\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction on that claim. However, we\n\nconclude that Resendiz did come forward with at least a scintilla of evidence to support his claim\n\nof sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment, and we therefore conclude that the trial\n\ncourt did not err in denying the Department\u2019s plea on that claim alone. Accordingly, we reverse\n\nthe trial court\u2019s judgment in part and affirm in part, and we remand this matter to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings based solely on Resendiz\u2019s claim of hostile work environment.\n\n\n                                               JEFF ALLEY, Justice\n\nNovember 29, 2021\n\nBefore Rodriguez, C.J., Palafox, and Alley, JJ.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\f",
