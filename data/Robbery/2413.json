Baker (\u201cMr. Baker\u201d) appeals from the district\n\n court\u2019s denial of his second or successive motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,\n\n challenging his convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). After we authorized this\n\n motion based on the Supreme Court\u2019s 2019 decision in United States v. Davis, ---\n\n U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2336 (2019), and the district court denied it, we granted\n\n Mr. Baker a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue:\n\n                             In light of the contention that Hobbs Act\n                             robbery can be accomplished by\n                             threatening injury to intangible\n                             property, was United States v.

Davis[]?\n\n Order, No. 20-3062, at 1 (10th Cir., filed June 10, 2020). Rather than directly\n\n address this issue, however, Mr. Baker, in his supplemental opening brief, 1 requests\n\n that we exercise our discretion to \u201cexpand\u201d the COA to cover the following, reframed\n\n issue:\n\n\n          1\n              We appointed the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the District\n of Colorado to represent Mr. Baker in his appeal, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 3006A(a)(2)(B). See Aplt.\u2019s Combined Opening Br. and Appl. for a COA; Order,\n No. 20-3062 at 2 (10th Cir., filed June 10, 2020). We also established the parties\u2019\n briefing schedule and specifically ordered Mr. Baker\u2019s counsel to file a supplemental\n opening brief within sixty days of our order, which counsel did.\n\n                                             2\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567         Date Filed: 09/26/2022   Page: 3\n\n\n\n                            Is Mr. Baker entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief\n                            because (a) the offenses relating to Hobbs\n                            Act robbery that underlie his \u00a7 924(c)\n                            convictions could have been committed\n                            by a threat to property; (b) the modified\n                            categorical approach does not rule out this\n                            possibility; (c) this court has no binding\n                            precedent that prevents it from holding\n                            that Hobbs Act robbery by a threat to\n                            property (whether tangible or intangible)\n                            does not satisfy \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s force [i.e.,\n                            elements] clause;[2] and (d) he can show\n                            his convictions rest on \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s\n                            unconstitutional residual clause?\n\n Aplt.\u2019s Suppl. Opening Br. at 2. In other words, Mr. Baker effectively attempts: (1)\n\n to argue that Hobbs Act robbery, when accomplished through threats to injure any\n\n property\u2014tangible or intangible\u2014is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A),\n\n and (2) our decision in United States v. Melgar-Cabrera, where we held Hobbs Act\n\n robbery categorically qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), see 892\n\n F.3d 1053, 1060 n.4 (10th Cir. 2018), does not bar his argument because it is\n\n inapposite.\n\n       Moreover, during the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court decided\n\n United States v. Taylor, --- U.S. ----, 142 S. Ct. 2015 (2022), holding that attempted\n\n Hobbs Act Robbery is not a crime of violence. We ordered supplemental briefing in\n\n light of Taylor, see Order, No. 20-3062, at 1 (10th Cir., filed June 23, 2022), and in\n\n Mr. Baker\u2019s brief, he requests that we either summarily vacate his \u00a7 924(c)\n\n\n       2\n             As will become apparent from our discussion, courts and litigants alike\n refer synonymously to the language of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) as either the \u201celements or force\n clause.\u201d Melgar-Cabrera, 892 F.3d at 1060.\n                                             3\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062     Document: 010110744567         Date Filed: 09/26/2022     Page: 4\n\n\n\n conviction charged in Count 11\u2014which is predicated on his conviction for attempted\n\n Hobbs Act robbery\u2014or remand the case to the district court to allow him to amend\n\n his \u00a7 2255 motion to make a Taylor-like argument. Aplt.\u2019s Suppl. Br. Filed Post-\n\n Taylor at 5.\n\n        Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the district court\u2019s\n\n dismissal of Mr. Baker\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, deny Mr. Baker\u2019s request to expand the\n\n COA and dismiss that portion of this matter, and remand the case to allow the\n\n district court to determine in the first instance whether it is lawful and otherwise\n\n appropriate to permit Mr. Baker to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to make a Taylor-like\n\n argument as to Count 11.\n\n                                              I\n\n        In March 2011, Mr. Baker was charged with numerous federal crimes in a\n\n multi-count indictment, including seven counts of Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of\n\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951; seven counts of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of\n\n violence (i.e., the Hobbs Act robberies), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and seven\n\n counts of being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun, in violation of 18\n\n U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). See generally United States v. Baker, 713 F.3d 558, 559 (10th Cir.\n\n 2013); see also Case No. 2:11-cr-20020-JWL, Doc. 16 (Indictment, filed Mar. 29,\n\n 2011). 3 Count 11 specifically charged Mr. Baker with a violation of \u00a7 924(c) based\n\n\n        3\n               Mr. Baker has not included documents from his initial prosecution, such\n as the indictment and jury verdict, in the record on appeal. We take judicial notice of\n these documents from the district court\u2019s docket. See, e.g., Bunn v. Perdue, 966 F.3d\n 1094, 1096 n.4 (10th Cir. 2020) (\u201cSome of the relevant . . . filings in district court . . .\n                                              4\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022     Page: 5\n\n\n\n on a crime-of-violence predicate of attempted Hobbs Act robbery. See Case No.\n\n 2:11-cr-20020-JWL, Doc. 16, at 6; Aplt.\u2019s Suppl. Br. Filed Post-Taylor at 5.\n\n       The charges related to a series of armed robberies in the Kansas City, Kansas,\n\n area in early 2011. See Baker, 713 F.3d at 560. Following a jury trial, Mr. Baker\n\n was convicted on all counts, see Case No. 2:11-cr-20020-JWL, Doc. 55 (Jury\n\n Verdict, filed Sept. 15, 2011), and he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment\n\n of 164 years, see id., Doc. 69 (Judgment, entered Jan. 18, 2012). We affirmed\n\n Mr. Baker\u2019s convictions. See Baker, 713 F.3d at 563.\n\n       Mr. Baker brought his first collateral challenge to his convictions under 28\n\n U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in 2014, but it was unsuccessful. See Case No. 2:11-cr-20020-JWL,\n\n Doc. 207 (Dist. Ct. Mem. & Order, entered June 17, 2015) (denying Mr. Baker\u2019s\n\n petition to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence). In 2016, Mr. Baker moved for\n\n authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion predicated on the\n\n purported invalidity of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), that is, the section\u2019s \u201cresidual clause.\u201d See\n\n Appl. for Leave to File a Successive Mot. under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, No. 16-3131 (10th\n\n Cir., filed May 20, 2016). Following United States v. Davis, in which the Supreme\n\n Court invalidated \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague, we\n\n authorized Mr. Baker to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion under \u00a7 2255(h)(2), as it\n\n would \u201crel[y] on \u2018a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on\n\n collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u2019\u201d R. at 29\n\n\n were not included in the record on appeal, but they are accessible from the district\n court docket. We may therefore take judicial notice of the filings.\u201d).\n                                            5\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062     Document: 010110744567         Date Filed: 09/26/2022    Page: 6\n\n\n\n (10th Cir. Order, filed Jan. 8, 2020) (citing In re Mullins, 942 F.3d 975, 979 (10th\n\n Cir. 2019)). In the district court, Mr. Baker challenged the validity of his \u00a7 924(c)\n\n convictions. Id. at 33\u201342 (Suppl. Br., filed Feb. 27, 2020). He argued that, given\n\n that Davis rendered the residual clause \u201cnow void,\u201d the only possible foundation for\n\n declaring his Hobbs Act robbery convictions to be crimes of violence was the\n\n elements clause, and that \u201cHobbs Act robbery is not \u2018categorically\u2019 a crime of\n\n violence under the elements clause.\u201d Id. at 35, 38.\n\n        The district court denied Mr. Baker\u2019s motion. Id. at 61\u201362 (Mem. & Order,\n\n entered Mar. 25, 2020). The court noted that we have \u201csquarely held that Hobbs Act\n\n robbery is categorically a crime of violence under the elements clause of\n\n \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) because that clause requires the use of force and the force element in\n\n Hobbs Act robbery \u2018can only be satisfied by violent force.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Melgar-\n\n Cabrera, 892 F.3d at 1064\u201365). The court also acknowledged that Mr. Baker\n\n \u201cargue[d] that Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence because it can be\n\n accomplished by damaging property,\u201d and that he cited United States v. Bowen, 936\n\n F.3d 1091 (10th Cir. 2019), for support. Id. at 62. However, Bowen, the district\n\n court explained, \u201cinvolved the relationship between 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3) and\n\n witness retaliation\u2014not Hobbs Act robbery\u201d; moreover, Melgar-Cabrera remained\n\n \u201cbinding precedent,\u201d and Mr. Baker failed to show how \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s\n\n invalidation of \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s [distinct] residual clause [i.e., in Davis] . . . change[d]\n\n Hobbs Act robbery\u2019s status as a crime of violence.\u201d Id. The court subsequently\n\n denied Mr. Baker\u2019s request for a COA. Id. at 66\u201367 (Mem. & Order, entered Apr.\n\n                                             6\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022     Page: 7\n\n\n\n 10, 2020) (declining to issue a COA because \u201c[r]easonable jurists could not debate\n\n the court\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Baker\u2019s petition in light of the fact that Hobbs Act\n\n robbery, under Tenth Circuit precedent, is categorically a crime of violence under the\n\n elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u201d).\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Baker filed a pro se opening brief and application for a COA,\n\n which we granted. See Aplt.\u2019s Combined Opening Br. and Appl. for a COA; Order,\n\n No. 20-3062, at 1 (10th Cir., filed June 10, 2020). \u201cIn accordance with \u00a7 2255(c),\u201d\n\n we granted a COA \u201cas to the following issue\u201d:\n\n                            In light of the contention that Hobbs Act\n                            robbery can be accomplished by\n                            threatening injury to intangible\n                            property, was United States v.

Davis[]?\n\n Order, No. 20-3062, at 1 (10th Cir., filed June 10, 2020). In other words, by granting\n\n the COA, we invited a reexamination of the validity and scope of our holding in\n\n Melgar-Cabrera\u2014more specifically, its crime-of-violence holding concerning the\n\n elements clause, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A))\u2014against the backdrop of the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\n decision in Davis, which struck down the other potential basis for a \u00a7 924(c)(3)\n\n crime-of-violence determination, the residual clause, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022      Page: 8\n\n\n\n       Yet, as discussed above, Mr. Baker in his supplemental opening brief\n\n effectively sidesteps the narrow question as to which we granted a COA\u2014centered\n\n on the vitality vel non of Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s holding as applied to threats to injure\n\n intangible property\u2014and asks that we exercise our discretion to \u201cexpand\u201d the COA\n\n to cover his broader argument that Hobbs Act robbery can be accomplished by\n\n threatening injury to any property, thus it does not satisfy \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s elements clause.\n\n Aplt.\u2019s Suppl.

After Davis,\n\n  then, a criminal conviction qualifies as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under\n\n  \u00a7 924(c) only if it meets the terms of clause (A)\u2014the \u201celements clause\u201d\u2014that is, only\n\n  if it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\n\n  against the person or property of another.\u201d Id. at 2324 (quoting \u00a7 924(c)(3)).\n\n         \u201cTo prevail on appeal, [a petitioner] must establish that his conviction[s]\n\n  cannot be sustained under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s elements clause.\u201d United States v.

Hobbs Act robbery is defined\n\n  as follows:\n\n                             Whoever in any way or degree\n                             obstructs, delays, or affects commerce\n                             or the movement of any article or\n                             commodity in commerce, by robbery or\n                             extortion or attempts or conspires so to\n                             do, or commits or threatens physical\n                             violence to any person or property in\n                             furtherance of a plan or purpose to do\n                             anything in violation of this section\n                             shall be fined under this title or\n                             imprisoned not more than twenty years,\n                             or both.\n\n  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a).

And as we have explained above, Mr. Baker further requests that \u201cwe expand the\n\n  COA to include\u201d the reframed question he poses: that is, whether Hobbs Act robbery is\n\n  not a crime of violence because the offenses involving Hobbs Act robbery that underlie\n\n  his \u00a7 924(c) convictions could have been committed by a threat to any property, which\n\n  purportedly does not satisfy \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s elements clause. Aplt.\u2019s Suppl. Opening Br. at 3.\n\n  He writes that \u201c[w]hat is true to threats to tangible property is also true as to threats to\n\n  intangible property.\u201d Id. at 27; see also id. at 28 (\u201c[A] threat to damage either tangible or\n\n  intangible property can be made without the threat of the violent force needed to satisfy\n\n  \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s force clause\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n         Mr. Baker does not opt to challenge the vitality of Melgar-Cabrera. Instead, he\n\n  suggests that Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s holding is inapposite and contends that, regardless of that\n\n  case, his offenses of Hobbs Act robbery are not crimes of violence; accordingly, they\n\n                                                13\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062     Document: 010110744567          Date Filed: 09/26/2022      Page: 14\n\n\n\n  would not support his convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Id. at 10.\n\n  Specifically, he writes that \u201cHobbs Act robbery (or its attempt) by a threat to any\n\n  property\u2014whether tangible or intangible\u2014is not a crime of violence of \u00a7 924(c).\u201d Id. at\n\n  10\u201311. And, as for Melgar-Cabrera, Mr. Baker thinks \u201cMelgar-Cabrera did not consider\n\n  the argument\u201d he makes on appeal: that decision, he avers, \u201cmerely rejected other\n\n  arguments for why Hobbs Act robbery does not satisfy the force clause.\u201d Id. at 10.\n\n         Having carefully considered Mr. Baker\u2019s arguments, however, we are not\n\n  persuaded. We conclude that Melgar-Cabrera is controlling here\u2014both as to the original\n\n  issue regarding which we granted a COA, and as to the question Mr. Baker presents in his\n\n  expansion request. As to the expansion request, we need not adjudicate the merits of Mr.\n\n  Baker\u2019s reframed question\u2014and indeed cannot properly do so, see Buck, 137 S. Ct. at\n\n  773\u2014in order to determine that the rejection of this question is not reasonably debatable\n\n  under Melgar-Cabrera. With that analytical limitation recognized, we conclude that\n\n  Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s holding is fatal to both his appeal and his request for an expansion of\n\n  the COA.\n\n         In Melgar-Cabrera, we were faced with the question of whether Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery is a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s elements clause, and we resolved it\n\n  clearly, \u201cemploy[ing] the categorical approach,\u201d to \u201cconclu[de] that Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery is a crime of violence under the elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3).\u201d 892 F.3d at\n\n  1060 n.4, 1061 (emphasis added). In other words, we concluded in Melgar-Cabrera\n\n  that Hobbs Act robbery is categorically a crime of violence. Id. at 1061. That we\n\n  reached this crime-of-violence determination under a categorical approach is\n\n                                              14\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062      Document: 010110744567          Date Filed: 09/26/2022      Page: 15\n\n\n\n  important for present purposes because it means that, in effect, we concluded that\n\n  every act\u2014including the least of the acts\u2014criminalized by Hobbs Act robbery\n\n  constitutes a crime a violence. See, e.g., Moncrieffe, 569 U.S. at 191 (noting that in\n\n  the categorical approach \u201cwe must presume that the conviction\u201d was grounded on\n\n  \u201c[nothing] more than the least of th[e] acts\u201d that the statute criminally punished\n\n  (alteration in original) (quoting Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 137 (2010))).\n\n         In our subsequent published decisions, we have left no doubt regarding the\n\n  categorical scope of our holding in Melgar-Cabrera. In United States v. Jefferson\n\n  (Jefferson I), for instance, we observed that Melgar-Cabrera \u201cdecided Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery is categorically a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u2019s elements clause\n\n  because the clause requires the use of violent force, i.e., force capable of causing\n\n  physical pain or injury to another person, and the force element in Hobbs Act robbery\n\n  can be satisfied only by violent force.\u201d 911 F.3d 1290, 1296 (10th Cir. 2018), cert.\n\n  granted, judgment vacated in part on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 861 (2020). We\n\n  reiterated our characterization of Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s holding after the Supreme Court\n\n  remanded the same case (i.e., Jefferson) for reasons not bearing on Melgar-Cabrera.\n\n  See United States v. Jefferson (Jefferson II), 989 F.3d 1173, 1175 (10th Cir. 2021)\n\n  (\u201cThis [remand] language does not open up the entire case for reconsideration.\n\n  Instead, it requires us to consider only the applicability of the First Step Act.

The Hobbs\n\n  Act is divisible between robbery and extortion . . . . But Hobbs Act robbery is not\n\n  further divisible.\u201d). In effect, then, Mr. Baker acknowledges that either Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery is a crime of violence, or it is not, as judged by the minimum conduct made\n\n  culpable by its terms. See Bowen, 936 F.3d at 1102; Muskett, 970 F.3d at 1239.\n\n  Mr. Baker\u2019s admissions are incompatible with the notion that Melgar-Cabrera\n\n  somehow left untouched a separate class of Hobbs Act robberies involving threats\n\n  against property that we may now assess with fresh eyes to determine if that class of\n\n  crimes qualifies as a crime of violence.\n\n        To be sure, Mr. Baker says that we can avoid Melgar-Cabrera by recognizing\n\n  that the case did not specifically grapple with his arguments here. See, e.g., Aplt.\u2019s\n\n  Suppl. Opening Br. at 28, 30\u201331. As his reasoning goes, because Melgar-Cabrera\n\n  did not consider the possibility that Hobbs Act robbery can be accomplished through\n\n  threats or \u201cfear of injury\u201d directed towards intangible or tangible property, we can\n\n                                             17\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022      Page: 18\n\n\n\n  hold that Hobbs Act robberies committed by such threats are not qualifying crimes of\n\n  violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).

In other words, the fact that the\n\n  defendant in Melgar-Cabrera did not provide the same or similar argument as\n\n  Mr. Baker\u2019s argument here is of no moment; we are bound to follow Melgar-Cabrera\n\n  absent a contrary decision by the Supreme Court or en banc reconsideration of\n\n                                             18\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062     Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022      Page: 19\n\n\n\n  Melgar-Cabrera. And on that point, Mr. Baker does not contend that any Supreme\n\n  Court decision, nor an en banc decision of this Court, abrogates Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s\n\n  holding.\n\n         Furthermore, Mr. Baker\u2019s reliance on United States v. Bowen and United\n\n  States v. O\u2019Connor to bolster his position is unavailing. See Aplt.\u2019s Suppl. Opening\n\n  Br. at 10\u201313. Mr. Baker claims that, under those two decisions, his specific\n\n  \u201cconvictions for Hobbs Act robbery . . . are not crimes of violence under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s\n\n  force clause.\u201d Id. at 10. Those two decisions, Mr. Baker avers, establish that Hobbs\n\n  Act robbery is not categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s elements clause\n\n  \u201cbecause it can be committed by a threat to harm property that does not involve a\n\n  threat to use violent force.\u201d Id. at 21.\n\n         However, as a panel of our court has persuasively reasoned, \u201c[w]e already\n\n  have stated that Bowen does not call into question Melgar\u2013Cabrera\u2019s holding that\n\n  Hobbs Act robbery is categorically a crime of violence.\u201d United States v.

(alteration in original and capitalization added) (omission in original)\n\n  (quoting Jefferson II, 989 F.3d at 1175 n.1). \u201cBut the same is not true of Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery\u201d since it \u201cnecessarily entails the use or threatened use of violent force\n\n  against a person or property.\u201d Jefferson II, 989 F.3d at 1175 n.1 (emphasis omitted).\n\n                                             19\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022    Page: 20\n\n\n\n  Thus, Bowen did not abrogate or restrict Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s holding, and Mr. Baker\u2019s\n\n  reliance on Bowen is unavailing.\n\n        As to O\u2019Connor, we observed that \u201c[b]ecause Hobbs Act robbery encompasses\n\n  threats to property and generic robbery excludes threats that are limited to property,\n\n  the minimum conduct necessary to constitute Hobbs Act robbery does not\n\n  categorically fall within generic robbery.\u201d O\u2019Connor, 874 F.3d at 1155.\n\n  Accordingly, we ruled that Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under\n\n  U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). Id. at 1158. In reaching that holding, we rejected the\n\n  government\u2019s argument that it would be \u201cincongruous\u201d to conclude that \u201cHobbs Act\n\n  robbery constitutes a crime of violence in relation to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) but not U.S.S.G.\n\n  \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1).\u201d Id. We explained that the two \u201cprovisions are not mirror images\u201d of\n\n  each other:\n\n                             The force clause under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1)\u2014\n                             the clause applicable here\u2014provides an\n                             offense is a crime of violence if it \u201chas\n                             as an element the use, attempted use, or\n                             threatened use of physical force against\n                             the person of another.\u201d By contrast, the\n                             force clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) includes\n                             any crime that \u201chas as an element the\n                             use, attempted use, or threatened use of\n                             physical force against the person or\n                             property of another.\u201d\n\n  Id. (first quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1); and then quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)).\n\n  Thus, O\u2019Connor found \u201c[t]here is nothing incongruous about holding that Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery is a crime of violence for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), which\n\n  includes force against a person or property, but not for purposes of U.S.S.G.\n\n                                            20\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022     Page: 21\n\n\n\n  \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), which is limited to force against a person.\u201d Id. Under a similar logic,\n\n  it does not ineluctably follow that because Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of\n\n  violence as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) that it is not a crime of violence as\n\n  defined in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). In sum, O\u2019Connor, like Bowen, did not disturb our\n\n  holding in Melgar-Cabrera as to whether Hobbs Act robbery is categorically a crime\n\n  of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). So, Mr. Baker\u2019s reliance on O\u2019Connor is\n\n  misplaced.\n\n                                                  ***\n\n        Accordingly, based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that Mr. Baker\u2019s\n\n  arguments are unavailing. We uphold the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Baker\u2019s\n\n  \u00a7 2255 motion as to the issue upon which we granted COA\u2014which questioned the\n\n  vitality of Melgar-Cabrera\u2019s holding as applied to threats to injure intangible\n\n  property. 5 Furthermore, applying the Supreme Court\u2019s well-defined COA\n\n\n        5\n                Notably, the Fourth Circuit rejected an argument that \u201cbecause Hobbs\n  Act robbery may be accomplished by threatening another with injury to intangible\n  property, such as shares of stock in a corporation, Hobbs Act robbery does not\n  qualify as a crime of violence under the [elements] clause.\u201d United States v. Mathis,\n  932 F.3d 242, 265 (4th Cir. 2019). The Fourth Circuit explained that \u201cfear of injury\u201d\n  \u201cnecessarily \u2018involves the threat to use [physical] force.\u2019\u201d Id. at 266 (alteration in\n  original) (quoting United States v.

Taylor. Taylor held\n\n  that attempted Hobbs Act robbery was categorically not a crime of violence under\n\n  \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). See 142 S. Ct. at 2024. However, Taylor left no room for reasonable\n\n  debate that the crime-of-violence status of the completed offense of Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery was not of analytical concern there; indeed, the Court expressly\n\n  acknowledged that the issue was not before it. See id. at 2020 (\u201cWhatever one might\n\n  say about completed Hobbs Act robbery, attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not\n\n  satisfy the elements clause.\u201d). Therefore, Taylor does not implicate our holding in\n\n  Melgar-Cabrera, which expressly addressed completed Hobbs Act robbery.\n\n        Taylor\u2019s holding is nevertheless of keen interest to Mr. Baker because his\n\n  Count 11 conviction under \u00a7 924(c) is predicated on attempted Hobbs Act robbery.\n\n  See Case No. 2:11-cr-20020-JWL, Doc. 16, at 6; Aplt.\u2019s Suppl.

Moreover, in a prior\n  unpublished decision, this Court specifically held that Hobbs Act robbery is a crime\n  of violence, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s argument that it is not because Hobbs\n  Act robbery encompasses creating fear of harm to intangible property. See United\n  States v. Dubarry, 741 F. App\u2019x 568, 569\u201370 (10th Cir. 2018) (unpublished).\n                                             22\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062    Document: 010110744567        Date Filed: 09/26/2022    Page: 23\n\n\n\n        Recall that the COA before us did not contemplate a separate and independent\n\n  crime-of-violence analysis for the offense of attempted Hobbs Act robbery. Rather,\n\n  our COA simply asked whether a Hobbs Act robbery\u2014without distinguishing\n\n  between a completed or an attempted offense\u2014which involved a threat to injure\n\n  intangible property was categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). And,\n\n  importantly, prior to Taylor, Mr. Baker never advocated for such a separate and\n\n  independent analysis for attempted Hobbs Act robbery. More specifically, prior to\n\n  Taylor, though Mr. Baker mentioned that he had been convicted of attempted Hobbs\n\n  Act robbery at numerous points in his briefing, he never made a separate argument\n\n  for relief confined to his attempted Hobbs Act robbery conviction. See, e.g., Aplt.\u2019s\n\n  Suppl. Opening Br. at 14, 16\u201317.\n\n        In other words, while Mr. Baker argued that the completed act of Hobbs Act\n\n  robbery is not categorically a crime of violence, he did not suggest\u2014as the\n\n  government points out\u2014that his conviction for attempted Hobbs Act robbery should\n\n  be analyzed separately on the crime-of-violence issue. See Aplee.\u2019s Resp. Br. at 22\n\n  n.8 (\u201c[Mr. Baker] does not contend that there is any difference between attempted\n\n  and completed Hobbs Act robbery for purposes of determining whether those\n\n  predicates qualify as crimes of violence under Section 924(c)(3)(A).

Therefore, Mr. Baker has not preserved\n\n  such an attempt-based, crime-of-violence argument for purposes of this appeal. See\n\n  Heard v. Addison, 728 F.3d 1170, 1175 (10th Cir. 2013) (\u201cWe do not reach\n\n  [petitioner\u2019s argument] in this case, however, because . . . we conclude that\n\n  [petitioner] never raised such a claim, in his petition or otherwise, before the federal\n\n  district court.\u201d); Bronson v. Swensen, 500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[W]e\n\n  routinely have declined to consider arguments that are not raised, or are inadequately\n\n  presented, in an appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d).\n\n        Notably, Mr. Baker does not argue now for an expansion of the COA in light\n\n  of Taylor. Instead, through his supplemental briefing, Mr. Baker asks that we either\n\n  summarily vacate his Count 11 conviction on the grounds that it is fatally infirm due\n\n  to Taylor, or alternatively, remand the proceedings to the district court to allow him\n\n  to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to make a Taylor-like argument in the first instance.\n\n  Aplt.\u2019s Suppl. Br. Filed Post-Taylor at 5\u201310. Because, as we have noted, the issue of\n\n  whether, standing alone, the offense of attempted Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of\n\n  violence was never properly raised in this appeal\u2014that is, we did not grant a COA\n\n  regarding that issue\u2014and, moreover, because Mr. Baker has failed to brief the issue\n\n  and has not sought an expansion of the COA to include the issue, we reject\n\n  Mr. Baker\u2019s request to summarily vacate his Count 11 conviction based on Taylor.\n\n        That said, we remand this action to the district court to determine whether it is\n\n  legally permissible and otherwise appropriate to allow Mr. Baker to amend his\n\n  \u00a7 2255 motion to advance a Taylor-like argument. See, e.g., Kerr v. Hickenlooper,\n\n                                             24\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062     Document: 010110744567         Date Filed: 09/26/2022    Page: 25\n\n\n\n  824 F.3d 1207, 1217 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cAppellate courts have \u2018discretion to remand\n\n  issues . . . to the trial court when that court has not had the opportunity to consider\n\n  the issue in the first instance.\u2019\u201d (quoting Salmon Spawning & Recovery All. v. U.S.\n\n  Customs & Border Prot., 550 F.3d 1121, 1134 (Fed. Cir. 2008))); cf. Tabor v. Hilti,\n\n  Inc., 703 F.3d 1206, 1227 (10th Cir. 2013) (\u201cWhere an issue has not been ruled on by\n\n  the court below, we generally favor remand for the district court to examine the\n\n  issue.\u201d).\n\n         More specifically, among the issues that the district court must decide on\n\n  remand is whether such an amendment would be timely. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f);\n\n  United States v. Mathisen, 822 F. App\u2019x 752, 753\u201354 (10th Cir. 2020) (unpublished)\n\n  (discussing the statute of limitations for \u00a7 2255 motions and amendments to such\n\n  motions). And, relatedly, the court must assess whether the amendment relates back\n\n  to Mr. Baker\u2019s original \u00a7 2255 motion. See FED. R. CIV. P. 15(c)(1)(B) (\u201cAn\n\n  amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when . . .\n\n  the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction,\n\n  or occurrence set out\u2014or attempted to be set out\u2014in the original pleading . . . .\u201d);\n\n  United States v. Roe, 913 F.3d 1285, 1296 (10th Cir. 2019) (noting that an amended\n\n  \u00a7 2255 motion can relate back to the date of the original \u00a7 2255 motion through the\n\n  workings of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(B) in certain \u201cconstrained\u201d\n\n  circumstances); id. at 1298 (explaining that \u201cthe operative question for purposes of\n\n  the applicability of Rule 15(c)(1)(B)\u2019s relation-back provision is whether \u2018the\n\n  original and amended [motions] state claims that are tied to a common core of\n\n                                              25\n\fAppellate Case: 20-3062     Document: 010110744567           Date Filed: 09/26/2022   Page: 26\n\n\n\n  operative facts.\u2019\u201d (quoting United States v. Trent, 884 F.3d 985, 992\u201393 (10th Cir.\n\n  2018)).\n\n        To be clear, however, in ordering this remand, it is not our intention to offer\n\n  any opinion\u2014and we do not do so\u2014on whether Mr. Baker should be permitted to\n\n  amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to include a Taylor-like argument or on the outcome of any\n\n  resulting proceeding, if such an amendment is permitted. In the first instance, we\n\n  leave those matters for the district court\u2019s resolution.\n\n                                              IV\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of\n\n  Mr. Baker\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, DENY Mr. Baker\u2019s request to expand the COA and\n\n  DISMISS that portion of this matter, and REMAND the case for further proceedings\n\n  consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f",
