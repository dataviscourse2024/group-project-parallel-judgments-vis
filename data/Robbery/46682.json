We haveju-risdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\nDominguez-Valencia contends that his underlying removal order, which was based on his conviction for burglary in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 459, is invalid in light of this court\u2019s decision in Dimaya v. Lynch, 803 F.3d 1110 (9th Cir. 2015), cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 31, 195 L.Ed.2d 902 (2016). Regardless of the merits of this contention, by entering an unconditional guilty plea, Dominguez-Valencia waived his right to challenge the validity of the underlying removal order. See Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973).\nDominguez-Valencia\u2019s unopposed motion to take judicial notice is granted.\nAFFIRMED,\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3,\n\n",
