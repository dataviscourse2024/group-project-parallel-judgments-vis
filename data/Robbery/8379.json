GARZA, Circuit Judges.\n\nPER CURIAM:*\n\n     At issue is whether an order denying an extension of time to\n\nfile a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is appealable.        Vernon Anthony\n\nMiller, a federal prisoner, was convicted of conspiracy to commit\n\nbank robbery, bank robbery and aiding and abetting, using and\n\ncarrying a firearm during a crime of violence and aiding and\n\nabetting, and interstate transport of a stolen vehicle and aiding\n\n\n\n\n*\n     Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that\nthis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\fand abetting.    The convictions were affirmed on direct appeal and\n\nthe Supreme Court denied certiorari on 7 October 1996.\n\n     On 25 July 1997, Miller moved in district court for an\n\nextension of time to file a \u00a7 2255 motion.    He contended that he\n\nhad been stabbed and placed in solitary confinement since 24 April\n\n1997, and that the prison law library was inadequate to prepare the\n\n\u00a7 2255 motion.\n\n     On 30 July 1997, the district court denied the extension,\n\nholding that any alleged impediment to Miller filing his \u00a7 2255\n\nmotion within the one-year limitation period would be litigated\n\nwhen Miller actually filed the \u00a7 2255 motion; if Miller prevailed\n\non such an allegation, then the limitations period would run from\n\nthe date the impediment was removed.     See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (as\n\namended) (a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed within one year from the\n\nlatest of, inter alia, the date the conviction becomes final, or\n\n\u201cthe date on which the impediment to making a motion created by\n\ngovernmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the\n\nUnited States is removed, if the movant is prevented from making a\n\nmotion by such government action\u201d).     But, instead of filing a \u00a7\n\n2255 motion, Miller filed a timely notice of appeal from the denial\n\nof his extension motion.\n\n     For purposes of this appeal, we have jurisdiction only from\n\n(1) final orders (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291); (2) orders that can be\n\nproperly certified as final (Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n\n                                  2\n\f1292(b)); and (3) specific interlocutory appeals (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1292(a)(1)).      See Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., Inc., 849 F.2d\n\n955, 957 (5th Cir. 1988).           A \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 1291\n\n\u201cgenerally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and\n\nleaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment\u201d.\n\nFrizzell v. Sullivan, 937 F.2d 254, 255 (5th Cir. 1991) (quotation\n\nomitted).   Needless to say, the collateral order doctrine, or some\n\nother exception, does not apply.         See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp.\n\nv. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 10 (1983) (\u201cTo come within\n\nthe \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions excepted from the final-judgment\n\nrule by     [Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp. 337 U.S. 541\n\n(1949)],    the   order   must   conclusively   determine   the    disputed\n\nquestion, resolve an important issue completely separate from the\n\nmerits of the action, and be effectively unreviewable from a final\n\njudgment.\u201d).\n\n     The district court did not issue a final judgment, nor did it\n\ncertify the order as final or eligible for interlocutory appeal.\n\nIn fact, at the time of the district court\u2019s order, Miller still\n\nhad several months in which to file his \u00a7 2255 motion.            He did not\n\ndo so, and still has not filed any \u00a7 2255 motion.           Accordingly,\n\nthis appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                                            DISMISSED\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f",
