Because the state\n\ndemonstrated that there was no reasonable possibility that the misconduct significantly\n\naffected the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm.\n\n                                           FACTS\n\n       In January 2015, appellant Shawn Rush was charged with possession of a theft tool\n\nin violation of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.59 (2014). At trial, A.K.A. testified that he is the owner of\n\nan auto-body-repair shop in Maplewood. According to A.K.A., his business is \u201cconnected\u201d\n\nto a car-wash business, and, depending on how busy he is, he may have anywhere from 10\n\nto 30 cars parked in the parking lot.\n\n       A.K.A. testified that on November 7, 2014, he noticed something moving underneath\n\none of his Jeep Grand Cherokees, but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t pay attention\u201d to it because he was\n\nmoving a car for a customer. A few minutes later, however, when he returned with another\n\nvehicle, A.K.A. observed the Jeep \u201cwobbling,\u201d and when he looked down, he saw two legs\n\nsticking out from underneath the Jeep. According to A.K.A., a person later identified as\n\nappellant, was lying on his back with his \u201ctoes pointed up in the air.\u201d A.K.A. could also\n\nhear sounds coming from under the Jeep like \u201csomething . . . metal to metal.\u201d\n\n       A.K.A. testified that he yelled at appellant, and when appellant stood up, he was\n\nholding a pipe cutter. Appellant then tried to run away, but A.K.A. and his employees were\n\nable to detain him until the police arrived. Further investigation revealed that one side of\n\nthe Jeep\u2019s catalytic converter had been \u201ccut off,\u201d and \u201cthe other side was almost cut off.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fA.K.A. claimed that \u201ca lot\u201d of catalytic converters had been stolen from his and a nearby\n\nbusiness property and that a used catalytic converter can garner $100 to $150 in cash.\n\n       Appellant denied possessing the pipe cutter or trying to steal the catalytic converter.\n\nInstead, appellant explained that he was at the car wash next to A.K.A.\u2019s body shop with his\n\nfriend B.P. According to appellant, he decided to walk home from the car wash because he\n\nwas tired of waiting while B.P. cleaned his car. Appellant claimed that as he \u201ccut between\n\nthe cars\u201d on A.K.A.\u2019s lot, he dropped his cigarette lighter, and when he \u201ccrawled\u201d\n\nunderneath the car to pick it up, he noticed a tool next to his lighter. Appellant testified that\n\nas he was retrieving his lighter, he heard someone yelling at him and that when he crawled\n\nout from underneath the vehicle, A.K.A. and his employees detained him.\n\n       Appellant did not call his friend B.P. as a witness in his defense. During rebuttal\n\nclosing argument, the prosecutor mentioned B.P.\u2019s absence from the proceedings and\n\ninvited the jury to judge the credibility of appellant\u2019s story based on B.P.\u2019s absence from the\n\ntrial. Appellant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments. The jury subsequently found\n\nappellant guilty of the charged offense. The district court then stayed imposition of\n\nsentence and placed appellant on probation. This appeal followed.\n\n                                       DECISION\n\n       This court reviews unobjected-to alleged prosecutorial misconduct under a\n\nmodified plain-error test. State v. Carridine, 812 N.W.2d 130, 146 (Minn. 2012). Three\n\nprongs must be satisfied under this test: there must be error, that is plain, and that affected\n\nthe defendant\u2019s substantial rights. State v. Ramey, 721 N.W.2d 294, 302 (Minn. 2006).\n\nThe defendant must establish the first two prongs of the test before the burden shifts to\n\n\n                                                3\n\fthe state to prove that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\n\nCarridine, 812 N.W.2d at 146. If we determine that a plain error affected the defendant\u2019s\n\nsubstantial rights, we \u201cmay correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d State v. Mosley, 853 N.W.2d 789,\n\n801 (Minn. 2014), cert denied 135 S. Ct. 1185 (2015) (quotations omitted)\n\n       A prosecutor has \u201cconsiderable latitude\u201d in a closing argument. State v. Williams,\n\n586 N.W.2d 123, 127 (Minn. 1998). But \u201c[i]t is well settled that a prosecutor may not\n\ncomment on a defendant\u2019s failure to call a witness.\u201d State v. Mayhorn, 720 N.W.2d 776,\n\n787 (Minn. 2006). The supreme court has provided two reasons for this rule: \u201c(1) the\n\ncomment suggests that the defendant bears some burden of proof; and (2) the comment\n\nsuggests that the defendant did not call the witness because his or her testimony would be\n\nunfavorable.\u201d Id.\n\n       Appellant argues that it was plain error for the prosecutor to comment on\n\nappellant\u2019s failure to call B.P. as a witness. The state concedes that the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s\n\nargument was plainly erroneous.\u201d But the state argues that the error did not affect\n\nappellant\u2019s substantial rights because the evidence against him was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\n       We agree. The state bears the burden to \u201cshow that there is no reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the absence of the misconduct in question would have had a significant\n\neffect on the verdict of the jury.\u201d Ramey, 721 N.W.2d at 302 (quotation omitted). We\n\nconsider \u201cthe strength of the evidence against the defendant, the pervasiveness of the\n\nimproper suggestions, and whether the defendant had an opportunity to (or made efforts\n\nto) rebut the improper suggestions.\u201d State v. Davis, 735 N.W.2d 674, 682 (Minn. 2007).\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       Here, the evidence against appellant was very strong. A.K.A. testified that on the\n\ndate of the alleged offense, he initially observed movement under a Jeep while moving a\n\nvehicle, and, when he returned to the Jeep a few minutes later, he observed appellant\n\nunderneath the vehicle. According to A.K.A., appellant was lying underneath the vehicle\n\nwith his toes pointed in the air as if he was doing something to the undercarriage of the\n\nJeep. A.K.A testified that when he yelled, appellant emerged from underneath the\n\nvehicle holding a pipe cutter and tried to flee the scene. A.K.A. testified that his body\n\nshop does not use pipe cutters and does not work on vehicles outside due to city\n\nregulations. Further evidence showed that the exhaust pipe next to the catalytic converter\n\nhad fresh cut marks, and A.K.A testified that a used catalytic converter can garner $100\n\nto $150 in cash. A.K.A. also testified that \u201ca lot\u201d of catalytic converters had been stolen\n\nfrom his and a nearby business property. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comment noting\n\nappellant\u2019s failure to produce B.P. as a witness had very little impact on the case.\n\n       Moreover, a review of the record demonstrates that the misconduct was not\n\npervasive. The misconduct was brief, at the end of trial, and there are no other\n\nallegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Although appellant did not have the opportunity\n\nto rebut the argument because the misconduct occurred during rebuttal, the state\u2019s\n\ndemonstration that its case was very strong and that the misconduct was not pervasive\n\nshow that the error did not affect appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Therefore, appellant is\n\nnot entitled to a new trial.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f",
