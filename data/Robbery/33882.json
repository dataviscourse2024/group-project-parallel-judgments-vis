In any event, this contention is without merit. The County Court\u2019s instruction clearly conveyed that it was the jury\u2019s responsibility to assure that the defendant\u2019s identification was proven beyond a reasonable doubt (see, People v Whalen, 59 NY2d 273). Thompson, J. P., Pizzuto, Santucci and Florio, JJ., concur.\n",
