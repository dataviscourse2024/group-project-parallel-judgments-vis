California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967). We affirm the\n\njudgment of sentence and grant counsel permission to withdraw.\n\n      On May 24, 2018, Chambers entered a negotiated guilty plea to robbery\n\nand possessing an instrument of crime. He was sentenced the same day,\n\npursuant to the negotiated plea agreement, to an aggregate eleven and one-\n\nhalf to twenty-three years\u2019 incarceration, followed by five years\u2019 probation.\n\nChambers did not file a post-sentence motion or a direct appeal.\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\n        After filing various pro se motions and petition for relief pursuant to the\n\nPost Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d)1 the trial court entered an order, granting\n\nin part and denying in part his PCRA petition, and reinstated Chambers\u2019 direct\n\nappeal rights nunc pro tunc, due to plea counsel\u2019s failure to file a requested\n\ndirect appeal. Plea counsel was permitted to withdraw from representation\n\nafter filing a Finley2 no-merit letter.\n\n        Appellate counsel was appointed and filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\nSubsequently, appellate counsel filed an Anders brief and a petition to\n\nwithdraw as counsel with this Court.\n\n        We turn first to counsel\u2019s petition to withdraw. To withdraw pursuant to\n\nAnders, counsel must:\n\n        1) petition the court for leave to withdraw stating that, after\n        making a conscientious examination of the record, counsel has\n        determined that the appeal would be frivolous; 2) furnish a copy\n        of the [Anders] brief to the [appellant]; and 3) advise the\n        [appellant] that he or she has the right to retain private counsel\n        or raise additional arguments that the [appellant] deems worthy\n        of the court\u2019s attention.\n\nCommonwealth v. Cartrette, 83 A.3d 1030, 1032 (Pa. Super. 2013) (en\n\nbanc) (citation omitted). With respect to the third requirement of Anders,\n\nthat counsel inform the appellant of his or her rights in light of counsel\u2019s\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\n\n\n2   See Commonwealth v. Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa. Super. 1988) (en banc).\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\nwithdrawal, this Court has held that counsel must \u201cattach to their petition to\n\nwithdraw a copy of the letter sent to their client advising him or her of their\n\nrights.\u201d Commonwealth v. Millisock, 873 A.2d 748, 752 (Pa. Super. 2005).\n\n      An Anders brief must comply with the following requirements:\n\n      (1) provide a summary of the procedural history and facts, with\n      citations to the record; (2) refer to anything in the record that\n      counsel believes arguably supports the appeal; (3) set forth\n      counsel\u2019s conclusion that the appeal is frivolous; and (4) state\n      counsel\u2019s reasons for concluding that the appeal is frivolous.\n      Counsel should articulate the relevant facts of record, controlling\n      case law, and/or statutes on point that have led to the conclusion\n      that the appeal is frivolous.\n\nCommonwealth v. Santiago, 978 A.2d 349, 361 (Pa. 2009). \u201c[I]f counsel\u2019s\n\npetition and brief satisfy Anders, we will then undertake our own review of\n\nthe appeal to determine if it is wholly frivolous.\u201d Commonwealth v. Wrecks,\n\n931 A.2d 717, 721 (Pa. Super. 2007) (brackets added, citation omitted).\n\n      We   find   appellate   counsel   has   complied   with   the   preliminary\n\nrequirements of Anders. Appellate counsel filed a petition to withdraw,\n\ncertifying he has reviewed the case and determined that Chambers\u2019s appeal\n\nis frivolous. Further, appellate counsel attached to his petition a copy of his\n\nletter to Chambers advising him of his rights, including his immediate right to\n\nproceed pro se and/or right to hire private counsel. Appellate counsel also filed\n\na brief, which includes a summary of the history and facts of the case,\n\npotential issues that could be raised by Chambers, and his assessment of why\n\nthose issues are meritless, with citations to relevant legal authority. Appellate\n\ncounsel has thus complied with the requirements of Anders.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\n      Chambers exercised his right to file a response, in which he asserts his\n\nappellate counsel \u201cneeds to work harder\u201d on his case. Pro Se Response,\n\n5/15/2020, at 1. Specifically, he states he informed his appellate counsel that\n\nhe was forced to put his name on the plea colloquy, that plea counsel filled\n\nout the colloquy and had written in Chambers\u2019s initials for him. See id.\n\nFurther, he asserted that plea counsel answered affirmatively to numerous\n\nquestions in the colloquy that he claims are lies, including whether he was\n\nfully informed and understood what he was pleading to, and whether he was\n\nforced to plead guilty. See id., at 1, 5-6. We proceed to review the issues\n\noutlined in the Anders brief as well as Chambers\u2019 response.\n\n      In his Anders brief, appellate counsel raises a potential issue regarding\n\nthe voluntariness of Chambers\u2019s guilty plea. Appellate counsel notes\n\nChambers contends that his mental state prevented his guilty plea from being\n\nknowing, intelligent and voluntary. While brief and undeveloped, it is clear\n\nChambers attempts to raise this matter in his response as well.\n\n      A defendant wishing to challenge the voluntariness of a guilty plea\n      on direct appeal must either object during the plea colloquy or file\n      a motion to withdraw the plea within ten days of sentencing.\n      Failure to employ either measure results in waiver. Historically,\n      Pennsylvania courts adhere to this waiver principle because [i]t is\n      for the court which accepted the plea to consider and correct, in\n      the first instance, any error which may have been committed.\n\nCommonwealth v. Lincoln, 72 A.3d 606, 609-610 (Pa. Super. 2013)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\n      Instantly, Chambers failed to properly preserve a claim challenging his\n\nguilty plea by either objecting during the plea colloquy or filing a post-\n\nsentence motion to withdraw the plea. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(1)(a)(i).\n\nAccordingly, Chambers is not entitled to relief on a claim challenging his plea.\n\n      Even if we did not find the issue waived, we note the issue is without\n\nmerit. The decision to allow a defendant to withdraw their plea post-sentence\n\nis a matter that rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. See\n\nCommonwealth v. Muhammad, 794 A.2d 378, 382 (Pa. Super. 2002).\n\nFurthermore, a request to withdraw a guilty plea made after sentencing is\n\nsubject to a higher scrutiny \u201csince courts strive to discourage [the] entry of\n\nguilty pleas as sentence-testing devices.\u201d Commonwealth v. Flick, 802 A.2d\n\n620, 623 (Pa. Super. 2002) (citation omitted). Therefore, in order to withdraw\n\na guilty plea after the imposition of sentence, a defendant must make a\n\nshowing of prejudice which resulted in a \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d Id. (citation\n\nomitted). A defendant meets this burden only if he can demonstrate that his\n\nguilty plea was entered involuntarily, unknowingly, or unintelligently. See\n\nCommonwealth v. Stork, 737 A.2d 789, 790 (Pa. Super. 1999).\n\n      Moreover, once a defendant enters a guilty plea, it is presumed that he\n\nwas aware of what he was doing. See id., at 790. Consequently, defendants\n\nare bound by statements they make at their guilty plea colloquy and may not\n\nsuccessfully assert any claims that contradict those statements. See\n\nMuhammad, 794 A.2d at 384.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\n      A review of the certified record amply supports our conclusion that\n\nChambers is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea post-sentencing.\n\n      Prior to the guilty plea hearing, Chambers completed a written guilty\n\nplea colloquy which set forth the elements of the offenses he was pleading to,\n\nthe factual basis for the plea, the permissible range of sentences he could\n\nreceive, and that the Court was not bound by the terms of the plea unless the\n\njudge accepted the plea agreement. See Guilty Plea Colloquy, 5/24/2018, at\n\n1-3, 6-7. Chambers acknowledged that he read and understood the charges\n\nand that his plea counsel explained the elements of the offenses to which he\n\nwas pleading guilty, and admitted to the offenses charged against him.\n\n      Plea counsel acknowledged Chambers suffered from mental health\n\nissues, but indicated he nevertheless understood the charges against him.\n\nSee id., at 5. Chambers affirmed that no one had forced, threatened, or\n\ncoerced him into pleading guilty, and no promises had been made to him other\n\nthan the proposed agreement with the Commonwealth. See id., at 9. Finally,\n\nChambers acknowledged he had enough time to discuss the charges with his\n\nplea counsel, he was satisfied with his representation, and plea counsel had\n\nanswered any questions that he had concerning the document. See id.\n\n      During the oral guilty plea colloquy, Chambers affirmed he was not\n\nunder the influence of any drugs or alcohol that would impact his ability to\n\nunderstand his plea. See N.T., Guilty Plea, 12/9/2019, at 5. Plea counsel again\n\nacknowledged Chambers\u2019 history with mental illness treatment - namely, for\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\ndepression and bipolar disorder - but affirmed that this history did not impact\n\nhis competence to \u201cthink about his case, to communicate with me, or with the\n\nCourt.\u201d Id., at 5-6. Chambers acknowledged he understood the written plea\n\ncolloquy, that he had gone over every question with plea counsel, and that he\n\nhad sufficient time with plea counsel to ask any questions he had regarding\n\nthe rights he was giving up. See id., at 6-7. He further affirmed that no one\n\nhad forced or threatened him in any way to induce his plea. See id., at 7.\n\n      Additionally, Chambers\u2019 plea counsel stated on the record that he had\n\nmet with Chambers at least three or four times prior to the hearing and found\n\nChambers to be communicative and conversational regarding his cases,\n\nincluding asking questions about the mechanisms of the legal process and trial\n\nprocess. See id., at 10. Plea counsel specifically stated he had no doubt that\n\nChambers was competent to make the decisions he was making. See id. In\n\naccepting the negotiated plea, the court concluded the plea was knowingly,\n\nvoluntarily, and intelligently made. See id., at 12.\n\n      In light of the comprehensive written and oral plea colloquy, which\n\nChambers fully and willingly completed, we find no manifest injustice to\n\nsupport his claim that his plea was in any manner unknowingly, involuntarily,\n\nor unintelligently given. As a result, Chambers\u2019 first issue is waived, and\n\nalternatively without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\n      In the remaining issue raised in the Anders brief, appellate counsel\n\nraises a potential issue regarding the sentence imposed. Counsel notes\n\nChambers contends his sentence should be reduced.\n\n      Because Chambers pled guilty, we must examine the effect of his guilty\n\nplea upon his sentencing claim. \u201cGenerally, a plea of guilty amounts to a\n\nwaiver of all defects and defenses except those concerning the jurisdiction of\n\nthe court, the legality of the sentence, and the validity of the guilty plea.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Morrison, 173 A.3d 286, 290 (Pa. Super. 2017) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n      It is well settled when the plea agreement contains a negotiated\n      sentence which is accepted and imposed by the sentencing court,\n      there is no authority to permit a challenge to the discretionary\n      aspects of that sentence. If either party to a negotiated plea\n      agreement believed the other side could, at any time following\n      entry of sentence, approach the judge and have the sentence\n      unilaterally altered, neither the Commonwealth nor any defendant\n      would be willing to enter into such an agreement. Permitting a\n      discretionary appeal following the entry of a negotiated plea would\n      undermine the designs and goals of plea bargaining, and would\n      make a sham of the negotiated plea process.\n\nId. (citation omitted)\n\n      Here, Chambers negotiated the terms of his guilty plea, including the\n\nspecific duration of the sentence with which he now takes issue. After\n\naccepting his plea, the trial court sentenced him to the agreed-upon sentence.\n\nChambers did not challenge the validity of the plea proceedings or move to\n\nwithdraw his plea. Therefore, Chambers received precisely the sentence for\n\nwhich he bargained, and cannot challenge the discretionary aspects of that\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\nsentence. See Commonwealth v. Eisenberg, 98 A.3d 1268, 1276 (Pa.\n\n2014) (\u201cWhen a negotiated plea includes sentencing terms \u2026 the defendant\u2019s\n\nknowing and voluntary acceptance of those terms rightly extinguishes the\n\nability to challenge a sentence the defendant knew was a proper consequence\n\nof his plea\u201d); see also Commonwealth v. Reichle, 589 A.2d 1140, 1141\n\n(Pa. Super. 1991) (dismissing Appellant\u2019s appeal of discretionary aspects of\n\nsentence where she received precisely what she was promised under the\n\nterms of her negotiated plea agreement); Commonwealth v. Baney, 860\n\nA.2d 127, 131 (Pa. Super. 2004) (finding an appellant may not challenge the\n\ndiscretionary aspects of his sentence when his negotiated plea included the\n\nterms of his sentence). Accordingly, Chambers is not entitled to relief on a\n\ndiscretionary aspects claim.\n\n      As far as Chambers\u2019s attempts to raise a challenge to the legality of his\n\nsentence, although the issue would be properly before us, we find this claim\n\nwithout merit.\n\n      Chambers implied in his PCRA petition that he was illegally sentenced\n\nunder the two-strike mandatory minimum statute. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9714.\n\nAs noted by plea counsel in his Finley no-merit letter, it would appear this\n\nclaim is premised on the belief that his sentence is illegal in light of the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\u2019s holding in Alleyne v. United States,\n\n570 U.S. 99 (2013) (holding that \u201cfacts that increase mandatory minimum\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\nsentences must be submitted to the jury\u201d and found beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt).\n\n      While Chambers\u2019s negotiated sentence was premised on the mandatory\n\nminimum sentence under Section 9714, Chambers is incorrect that that\n\nprovision is unconstitutional under Alleyne. Mandatory minimum sentences\n\npredicated on prior convictions are an exception to the rule announced in\n\nAlleyne. See id., at 111 n.1.\n\n      As this Court has recognized, the mandatory minimum sentences set\n\nforth in section 9714 are predicated on prior convictions and, thus, that\n\nprovision is not unconstitutional under Alleyne. See Commonwealth v.\n\nBragg, 133 A.3d 328, 333 (Pa. Super. 2016) (recognizing that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n9714 \u201cis not unconstitutional under Alleyne as it provides for mandatory\n\nsentences based on prior convictions\u201d), aff'd, Commonwealth v. Bragg, 169\n\nA.3d 1024 (Pa. 2017) (per curiam order). Thus, Chambers\u2019 challenge to the\n\nlegality of his sentence is meritless.\n\n      After an independent review of the record, we note that Chambers could\n\npotentially raise a claim of ineffective assistance of plea counsel, as he raised\n\nthis matter in his pro se PCRA petition, and alludes to such a claim in his\n\nresponse to the Ander\u2019s brief. Such a claim, however, could only properly be\n\nbrought on collateral review.\n\n      \u201cOur Supreme Court has made clear that ineffectiveness claims are not\n\nto be raised in the first instance on direct appeal but must await collateral\n\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\nreview.\u201d Commonwealth v. Crosby, 844 A.2d 1271, 1271-1272 (Pa. Super.\n\n2004). An exception is made where the trial court has held a hearing on a\n\nclaim of trial counsel ineffectiveness and the record has been fully developed\n\non that issue. In that case, the Supreme Court has held it is appropriate for\n\nthis Court to review an ineffectiveness claim on direct appeal. See id., at\n\n1272.\n\n        Here, the trial court has not held a hearing on the issue and the record\n\nhas not been developed at all on this issue. Therefore, we do not have a record\n\nupon which we can review an ineffectiveness claim. Accordingly, a claim\n\nregarding plea counsel ineffectiveness would be dismissed without prejudice.\n\nChambers can raise this claim on collateral review where the PCRA court will\n\nbe in a position to hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim, if necessary.\n\n        Having reviewed the issues raised in counsel\u2019s Anders brief, and after\n\nconducting our own independent review of the record, we agree with counsel\n\nthat the within appeal is wholly frivolous.3 As such, we affirm the judgment\n\nof sentence and grant counsel leave to withdraw.\n\n        Judgement of sentence affirmed. Petition for leave to withdraw granted.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3We note our independent review of the record did not reveal any additional\nnon-frivolous issues for appeal.\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\fJ-A19015-20\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
