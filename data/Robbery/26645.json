We affirm.\n\n       The trial court summarized the history of this case as follows.\n\n             On June 4, 2018, a bench trial was held before this court,\n       and [Appellant] was convicted of the following charges: [count 1]\n       possession with intent to deliver (\u201cPWID\u201d) - Oxycodone; [count 2]\n       possession of a controlled substance - Xanax; [count 3]\n       possession of drug paraphernalia; [count 4] theft by unlawful\n       taking (\u201cTBUT\u201d); disorderly conduct and public drunkenness.\n       [Appellant] was determined to be eligible for the recidivism risk\n       reduction incentive (\u201cRRRI\u201d) program.            A pre-sentence\n       investigation report (\u201cPSI report\u201d) was ordered, and sentencing\n       was deferred.\n\n            With a prior record score of five, the sentencing guidelines\n       worksheets provided to the court indicated the following standard\n       minimum incarceration sentence ranges for the offenses of which\n       [Appellant] was convicted, as well as the number of months to be\n       added or subtracted for aggravating or mitigating circumstances:\n\n\n\n\n*    Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\n     Count   1    .   .   .    7[2] - 90 months,       +/-    12 months\n     Count   2    .   .   .    6 - 16 months,          +/-    9 months\n     Count   3    .   .   .

[Appellant]\u2019s aggregate term of incarceration was nine\n     to twenty years\u2019 incarceration, with an RRRI minimum of seventy-\n     eight and one-half months, plus costs.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 8/27/18, at 1-2 (footnotes, unnecessary capitalization,\n\nand repetition of values in numerical form omitted).\n\n     Appellant filed a timely post-sentence motion seeking modification of his\n\nsentence.   The trial court denied the motion, after which Appellant filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal.      The trial court did not order Appellant to file a\n\nstatement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b),\n\nand none was filed.\n\n     Appellant submits the following questions for this Court\u2019s consideration:\n\n     I.    Was the trial court\u2019s aggregate sentence of 9 to 20 years of\n     incarceration following a bench trial so manifestly excessive as to\n     constitute too severe a punishment, unreasonable under the\n     circumstances of this case, inconsistent with the rehabilitative\n     needs of the defendant, and therefore, an abuse of discretion?\n\n     II.   Did the [trial c]ourt err when it used as its sole reason for\n     the consecutive sentences, erroneous considerations including the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\n      nature of the instant charges which is already considered in the\n      applicable guideline ranges?\n\nAppellant\u2019s brief at 6.\n\n      The following principles apply to our consideration of whether\n\nAppellant\u2019s questions raise a viable challenge to the discretionary aspects of\n\nhis sentence.\n\n      An appellant is not entitled to the review of challenges to the\n      discretionary aspects of a sentence as of right. Rather, an\n      appellant challenging the discretionary aspects of his sentence\n      must invoke this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. We determine whether the\n      appellant has invoked our jurisdiction by considering the following\n      four factors:\n\n            (1) whether appellant has filed a timely notice of\n            appeal; (2) whether the issue was properly preserved\n            at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify\n            sentence; (3) whether appellant\u2019s brief has a fatal\n            defect; and (4) whether there is a substantial question\n            that the sentence appealed from is not appropriate\n            under the Sentencing Code.\n\nCommonwealth v. Samuel, 102 A.3d 1001, 1006-07 (Pa.Super. 2014)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n      Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and preserved the issue in a\n\ntimely post-sentence motion seeking reconsideration of his sentence.\n\nAppellant\u2019s brief contains a statement of reasons relied upon for his challenge\n\nto the discretionary aspects of his sentence as required by Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f).\n\nThus, we consider whether Appellant has raised a substantial question.\n\n      Appellant avers that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive and\n\ninconsistent with his rehabilitative needs because the trial court failed to\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\nconsider mitigating factors, and that it is improperly based upon the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s double counting of a factor already contemplated by the sentencing\n\nguidelines.   Appellant\u2019s brief at 6, 13-14. We conclude that Appellant has\n\nraised a substantial question that the sentence is not appropriate under the\n\nsentencing code. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dodge, 77 A.3d 1263, 1273\n\n(Pa.Super. 2013) (holding claims that the trial court failed to consider relevant\n\nsentencing criteria and relied upon impermissible sentencing factors presented\n\nsubstantial questions). Therefore, we shall proceed to address the merits of\n\nAppellant\u2019s claims.\n\n      \u201cWhen reviewing sentencing matters, this Court must accord the\n\nsentencing court great weight as it is in the best position to view the\n\ndefendant\u2019s character, displays of remorse, defiance or indifference, and the\n\noverall effect and nature of the crime.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ventura, 975\n\nA.2d 1128, 1134 (Pa.Super. 2009).        \u201cWe cannot re-weigh the sentencing\n\nfactors and impose our judgment in the place of the sentencing court.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Macias, 968 A.2d 773, 778 (Pa.Super. 2009). Hence,\n\nwe review the sentencing court\u2019s sentencing determination for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n      In this context, an abuse of discretion is not shown merely by an\n      error in judgment. Rather, the appellant must establish, by\n      reference to the record, that the sentencing court ignored or\n      misapplied the law, exercised its judgment for reasons of\n      partiality, prejudice, bias or ill will, or arrived at a manifestly\n      unreasonable decision.\n\nCommonwealth v. Antidormi, 84 A.3d 736, 760 (Pa.Super. 2014).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\n      While its discretion is broad, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s discretion is not\n\nunfettered.\u201d   Commonwealth v. Coulverson, 34 A.3d 135, 144 (Pa.Super.\n\n2011). A trial court\u2019s sentence \u201cshould call for confinement that is consistent\n\nwith the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense as it relates to the\n\nimpact on the life of the victim and on the community, and the rehabilitative\n\nneeds of the defendant.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(b).\n\n      \u201cWhen imposing sentence, a court is required to consider the particular\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the character of the defendant.               In\n\nconsidering these factors, the court should refer to the defendant\u2019s prior\n\ncriminal record, age, personal characteristics and potential for rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nAntidormi, supra at 761 (citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cAnd, of\n\ncourse, the court must consider the sentencing guidelines.\u201d         Coulverson,\n\nsupra at 144 (cleaned up).\n\n      With these principles in mind, we turn to Appellant\u2019s first argument,\n\nwhich he states as follows:\n\n             [Appellant] has had a drug addiction for over ten years. His\n      addiction stemmed from a hand injury for which he received an\n      injection of Dilantin. He has been using opiates in one form or\n      another since that time. [Appellant] had been staying with his\n      aunt in the month prior to his arrest, and he stole her newly-filled\n      prescription for Oxycodone. At trial, he testified that he felt bad\n      for stealing from his aunt, and eventually planned to return the\n      pills to her.\n\n              Given the circumstances underlying how [Appellant] got the\n      pills, the fact that he admitted to taking them and that he planned\n      on returning them, the application of the standard guidelines and\n      a concurrent sentence would have been appropriate. The court\u2019s\n      sentence in this case was clearly unreasonable, as it is\n\n                                      -5-\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\n      unnecessary to confi[n]e [Appellant] to incarceration for a\n      minimum of nine years, when it is clear that he could benefit from\n      rehabilitation and treatment for his drug addiction.\n\nAppellant\u2019s brief at 19 (citations omitted). In sum, Appellant\u2019s position is that\n\n\u201cthe circumstances of the offense and [Appellant\u2019s] drug history are in favor\n\nof a lesser sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 18.\n\n      The trial judge had the benefit of a PSI report, and is therefore presumed\n\nto   have   considered   all   appropriate   sentencing   factors.   See,   e.g.,\n\nCommonwealth v. Edwards, 194 A.3d 625, 638 (Pa.Super. 2018).\n\nMoreover, the trial court expressly acknowledged that Appellant\u2019s addiction\n\nplayed a role in his crimes, but that he had not availed himself of the \u201cmany\n\nopportunities to seek treatment and rehabilitation and make changes\u201d that he\n\nhas had, given his long involvement with the criminal justice system. N.T.\n\nSentencing, 8/13/18, at 12.       Rather, Appellant continued to engage in a\n\nnumber of \u201cextremely serious crimes\u201d that demonstrate that he is \u201ca threat to\n\nthe community.\u201d Id.\n\n      Thus, the record reveals that the trial court did consider the appropriate\n\nfactors. Appellant simply does not like the weight that the trial court accorded\n\nthem, and he asks this Court to re-weigh the competing factors to reach a\n\ndifferent result. This we cannot do. See, e.g., Macias, supra at 778 (\u201cWe\n\ncannot re-weigh the sentencing factors and impose our judgment in the place\n\nof the sentencing court.\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\n       Appellant\u2019s second argument is that the trial court considered improper\n\nfactors in determining the sentence, in effect double counting a consideration\n\nthat was already incorporated in the sentencing guidelines.1        Specifically,\n\nAppellant points to the trial court\u2019s reliance upon the fact that Appellant stole\n\na purse from someone who was \u201ccompletely an innocent bystander\u201d in\n\ndeciding upon an aggravated range sentence for TBUT. Appellant\u2019s brief at\n\n20.   Appellant maintains that such \u201cis a factor that is already considered in\n\ndetermining the standard range of the sentencing guidelines for the [TBUT]\n\ncharge, as most victims of theft are innocent victims who did not ask or\n\nconsent to have their belongings taken.\u201d Id. at 20-21.\n\n       The context of the trial court\u2019s statement at the sentencing proceeding\n\nis as follows:\n\n       [W]hat made you need to steal that purse, I have no idea. And\n       that person is completely an innocent bystander in all of this. This\n       wasn\u2019t somebody in a drug deal gone bad, or anything like that\n       who has done anything to you.\n\n            It is, in my opinion, by my observation of your record, one\n       more of many extraordinarily poor decisions that you\u2019ve made,\n       not unlike many of the fleeing and attempting to elude\n       apprehension charges that you\u2019ve faced.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 On appeal, Appellant also raises a double-counting claim in that the trial\ncourt\u2019s complaint that, by selling drugs, Appellant was \u201cgetting out there and\ninfluencing other people by putting product in their way,\u201d which was \u201cthe very\ndefinition\u201d of PWID. Appellant\u2019s brief at 21. This issue was not raised before\nthe trial court, and is therefore not properly before us. See Commonwealth\nv. Samuel, 102 A.3d 1001, 1006 (Pa.Super. 2014) (providing that a\nsentencing challenge must have been \u201cproperly preserved at sentencing or in\na motion to reconsider and modify sentence\u201d).\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\n            You do things, it would seem, very impulsively based on\n      what you believe your immediate best interest is, which is to get\n      the heck out of Dodge when it looks like things are going to go\n      south for you.\n\n               ....\n\n            [TBUT], movable property, this person was an absolute\n      innocent bystander having nothing to do whatsoever with\n      anything that [Appellant] was in the neighborhood for and,\n      therefore, I am going to sentence in the aggravated range[.]\n\nN.T. Sentencing, 8/13/18, at 13-14, 16.         In its opinion, the trial court\n\nreiterated that it \u201cwas extremely troubled by the circumstances under which\n\nthe theft occurred, as [Appellant] haphazardly decided to steal an innocent\n\nbystander[\u2019]s purse while possessing, and intending to distribute, a large\n\nquantity of narcotics.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 8/27/18, at 7.\n\n      A person commits TBUT \u201cif he unlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful\n\ncontrol over, movable property of another with intent to deprive him thereof.\u201d\n\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3921(a). Plainly, the trial court\u2019s concerns are not incorporated\n\nwithin the elements of the crime. Rather, they reflect the trial court\u2019s required\n\nconsideration of \u201cthe particular circumstances of the offense and the character\n\nof the defendant.\u201d      Antidormi, supra at 761 (cleaned up).      As such, we\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s reliance upon the nature of\n\nthe   victim    in    imposing   an   aggravated-range   sentence.       Accord\n\nCommonwealth v. Goggins, 748 A.2d 721, 732 (Pa.Super. 2000) (holding\n\nsentencing court did not double-count the amount of drugs possessed by\n\ndefendant in imposing a sentence above the applicable drug-weight-based\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fJ-S28008-19\n\n\nmandatory minimum; instead, its focus upon the number of packets of the\n\ndrug, and hence the number of individuals to whom they were intended to be\n\nsold, reflected proper consideration of the impact of the offense on the public).\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
