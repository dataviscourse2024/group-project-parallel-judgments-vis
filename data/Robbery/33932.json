The charges stemmed from an incident occurring in July 1994 as petitioner and another inmate were being escorted back to their cells following a court appearance. After the other inmate removed his personal property from a cart, six bags remained and, according to a correction officer, petitioner indicated that all of the bags belonged to him. As it developed, only three of the six bags actually belonged to petitioner. Following a disciplinary hearing, petitioner was found guilty of possessing contraband, interfering with facility employees and making false statements, and a 30-day suspended penalty was imposed. Petitioner\u2019s subsequent administrative appeal was unsuccessful, prompting the commencement of this proceeding to set aside respondent\u2019s determination.\nAs a starting point, petitioner\u2019s assertion that the determination should be annulled due to various procedural errors is lacking in merit. Because petitioner already was being held in restrictive confinement at the time of the incident, the requirement that his hearing be held within seven days of confinement simply was not applicable (see, Matter of Covington v Stinson, 221 AD2d 739). Additionally, inasmuch as the correction officers who witnessed the incident either testified at the hearing or had their testimony waived by petitioner, the failure of certain officers to endorse the misbehavior report in no way prejudiced petitioner (see, Matter of Smith v Walker, 209 AD2d 799, 800, lv denied 85 NY2d 807). Finally, the record does not support petitioner\u2019s claim that the Hearing Officer was biased or should otherwise have been disqualified from conducting the hearing in question (see, Matter of Blackshear v Coughlin, 185 AD2d 493, 493-494).\nTurning to the merits, although the misbehavior report and the testimony of the hearing witnesses, including petitioner, established that petitioner was guilty of possessing contraband and making false or misleading statements, we agree with petitioner that the charge of interfering with facility employees is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. In support of this rule violation, respondent argues that petitioner\u2019s misleading statements necessitated a search of the entire gallery, thereby interfering with the correction officers\u2019 routine daily duties. In our view, although such conduct may well have supported a violation of rule 104.13 (7 NYCRR 270.2 [B] *842[5] [iv] [disturbing the order of the facility]),* it simply is not the type of conduct rule 107.10 (7 NYCRR 270.2 [B] [8] [i] [verbally or physically interfering with a facility employee]) was designed to prevent (see, e.g., Matter of Readdon v Mitchell, 210 AD2d 710). Accordingly, the determination finding petitioner guilty of violating rule 107.10 must be annulled and, under the circumstances, all references to this charge should be expunged from petitioner\u2019s institutional record. Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions, including his assertion that the penalty imposed was improper, have been examined and found to be lacking in merit.\nMikoll, J. P., Mercure, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is modified, without costs, by annulling so much thereof as found petitioner guilty of violating prison disciplinary rule 107.10; all references to said charge are to be expunged from petitioner\u2019s institutional record; and, as so modified, confirmed.\n\n Inexplicably, although petitioner was charged with violating rule 104.13, no reference was made to this charge in the determination rendered in this matter.\n\n",
