CHARLES EDWIN MASON v. THE STATE.\n\n       In 2013, a jury found Charles Edwin Mason guilty of one count of burglary,\none count of criminal trespass, two counts of possession of tools for the commission\nof a crime, one count of felony theft by taking, and two counts of forgery in the\nsecond degree. His convictions were affirmed on appeal, and the remittitur was dated\nSeptember 29, 2014. Mason v. State, 325 Ga. App. 609 (754 SE2d 397) (2014).\nMason subsequently filed a pro se motion to vacate a void judgment, which the trial\ncourt denied. On January 28, 2015, we dismissed Mason\u2019s application for\ndiscretionary appeal from that order. See Case No. A15D0223. Mason then filed a pro\nse motion to correct sentence, which the trial court denied. This application seeks\nreview of the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion. We, however, lack jurisdiction.\n       Under OCGA \u00a7 17-10-1 (f), a court may modify a sentence during the year\nafter its imposition or within 120 days after remittitur following a direct appeal,\nwhichever is later. Frazier v. State, 302 Ga. App. 346, 347-348 (691 SE2d 247)\n(2010); Burg v. State, 297 Ga. App. 118, 118 (676 SE2d 465) (2009). Once this\nstatutory period expires, as it had here when Mason filed his motion, a trial court may\nmodify a sentence only if it is void. Jones v. State, 278 Ga. 669, 670 (604 SE2d 483)\n(2004). And a sentence is void only when the trial court imposes punishment that the\nlaw does not allow. Jordan v. State, 253 Ga. App. 510, 511 (1) (559 SE2d 528)\n(2002). \u201cMotions to vacate a void sentence generally are limited to claims that \u2013 even\nassuming the existence and validity of the conviction for which the sentence was\nimposed \u2013 the law does not authorize that sentence, most typically because it exceeds\nthe most severe punishment for which the applicable penal statute provides.\u201d Von\nThomas v. State, 293 Ga. 569, 572 (2) (748 SE2d 446) (2013). \u201cAssertions taking\n\fissue with the procedure employed in imposing a valid sentence or questioning the\nfairness of an imposed sentence do not allege a sentence is void.\u201d Coleman v. State,\n305 Ga. App. 680, 680-681 (700 SE2d 668) (2010).\n       Here, Mason does not argue that his sentence exceeds the most severe\npunishment for which the applicable penal statute provides. Rather, he argues that his\nsentence should be corrected because the trial court failed to exercise discretion in\nsentencing him. Mason, however, was sentenced as a recidivist, and under the\nrecidivist statute, \u201cthe trial judge may, in his or her discretion, probate or suspend the\nmaximum sentence prescribed for the offense.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) OCGA \u00a7 17-10-\n7 (a). Mason also asserts that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\nand should be reduced because the legislature subsequently reduced the maximum\nsentence in his type of burglary case, see OCGA \u00a7 16-7-1 (c), but he has pointed to\nno evidence showing that the legislature intended any revised sentencing guidelines\nto be applied retroactively. Mason does not argue that his sentence exceeds the\nstatutory maximum in existence at the time he was sentenced for his offenses, and\n\u201c[t]he universal and well-settled rule of statutory construction is that legislative\nenactments are not intended to operate retroactively unless there is a clear directive\nthat they do so, and that persons who commit crimes are to be convicted and\nsentenced under the laws that existed at the time the crimes were committed.\u201d\nHumphrey v. Wilson, 282 Ga. 520, 528 n. 41 (3) (c) (652 SE2d 501) (2007) (citations\nand punctuation omitted).\n       Because Mason has not raised a valid void-sentence claim, we may not\nconsider his application. See Harper v. State, 286 Ga. 216, 217 (1) (686 SE2d 786)\n(2009). Accordingly, this application is hereby DISMISSED.\n\n                                         Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\n                                                                              09/09/2015\n                                                Clerk\u2019s Office, Atlanta,____________________\n                                                I certify that the above is a true extract from\n                                         the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\n                                                Witness my signature and the seal of said court\n                                         hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\n\n\n                                                                                         , Clerk.\n\f",
