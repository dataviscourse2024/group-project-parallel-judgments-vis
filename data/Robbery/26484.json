FILED MARCH 05, 2019\n\n      Gartor Brown appeals from the judgement of sentence entered in the\n\nChester County Court of Common Pleas on July 5, 2017. He argues the court\n\nabused its discretion in sentencing Brown outside the standard guidelines\n\nrange thereby fashioning an excessive sentence without addressing his\n\nrehabilitative needs. He also argues the court abused its discretion in relying\n\non impermissible factors when imposing an aggravated range sentence. We\n\naffirm.\n\n      On June 14, 2017, following a non-jury trial, Brown was found guilty of\n\naggravated harassment by prisoner. He was found not guilty of possessing an\n\ninstrument of crime. On July 5, 2017, Brown was sentenced to 24-28 months\n\nin prison. During the same hearing, he was also sentenced for unrelated\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\ncharges of Burglary, Theft by Unlawful Taking and Criminal Trespass. The\n\nsentences were imposed to run consecutively.\n\n      On July 14, 2017, Brown filed a motion to modify sentence. The trial\n\ncourt denied his motion. This timely appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, Brown raises two challenges to the trial court\u2019s exercise of\n\ndiscretion in imposing sentence.\n\n      Challenges to the discretionary aspects of sentencing do not\n      entitle an appellant to review as of right. An appellant challenging\n      the discretionary aspects of his sentence must invoke this Court's\n      jurisdiction by satisfying a four-part test:\n\n         We conduct a four-part analysis to determine: (1) whether\n         appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal, see Pa.R.A.P.\n         902 and 903; (2) whether the issue was properly\n         preserved at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and\n         modify sentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P. 720; (3) whether\n         appellant's brief has a fatal defect, Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and\n         (4) whether there is a substantial question that the\n         sentence appealed from is not appropriate under the\n         Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9781(b).\n\nCommonwealth v. Griffin, 65 A.3d 932, 935 (Pa. Super. 2013) (some\n\ninternal citations omitted). Brown has satisfied the first three requirements:\n\nhe timely filed a notice of appeal, he sought reconsideration of his sentence in\n\na post-sentence motion, and he has included a Rule 2119(f) statement in his\n\nbrief to this Court. We next consider whether he has raised a substantial\n\nquestion for our review.\n\n      \u201cThe determination of what constitutes a substantial question must be\n\nevaluated on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Commonwealth v. Battles, 169 A.3d\n\n1086, 1090 (Pa. Super. 2017) (citation omitted). \u201cA substantial question\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\nexists only when the appellant advances a colorable argument that the\n\nsentencing judge's actions were either: (1) inconsistent with a specific\n\nprovision of the Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary to the fundamental norms\n\nwhich underlie the sentencing process.\u201d Commonwealth v. Foust, 180 A.3d\n\n416, 439 (Pa. Super. 2018) (citation omitted).\n\n       First, Brown argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nsentencing him outside the standard guideline range thereby fashioning an\n\nexcessive sentence without addressing his rehabilitative needs as required by\n\n42 Pa. C.S.A. 9721(b). Appellant\u2019s brief, at 14. The guideline range here was\n\ntwelve to eighteen months in the standard range, plus or minus six in the\n\naggravated or mitigated range.1 Brown was sentenced within the aggravated\n\nrange, at twenty-four to forty-eight months.\n\n       A \u201cbald assertion that a sentence is excessive does not by itself raise a\n\nsubstantial question justifying this Court\u2019s review of the merits of the\n\nunderlying claim.\u201d Commonwealth v. Fisher, 47 A.3d 155, 159 (Pa. Super.\n\n2012) (citation omitted).         However, an excessive   sentence    claim, in\n\nconjunction with a claim that the trial court failed to properly consider\n\nmitigating factors, raises a substantial question. See Commonwealth v.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 Based on the guidelines that have been adopted by the Pennsylvania\nCommission on Sentencing, this range would indicate a prior record score of\nthree. We could not independently verify the prior record score based on the\nrecord in front of us, but note that this range has been uncontested. See\nAppellant\u2019s Brief, at 4.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\nRaven, 97 A.3d 1244, 1253 (Pa. Super. 2014). Here, Brown argues that the\n\nsentence is excessive, and that the trial court failed to adequately consider his\n\nrehabilitative needs. Pursuant to Raven, he has raised a substantial question,\n\nand we proceed to address the substance of his argument.\n\n       Brown centers his first issue around the contention that the trial court\n\nfailed to adequately consider his rehabilitative needs. The trial court made it\n\nclear at sentencing that one of its main concerns was that Brown repeatedly\n\ncommitted crimes while on probation and parole, and thus has not been\n\namenable to rehabilitation while under supervision. See N.T., Sentencing,\n\n7/5/17, at 16. Admittedly, the sentencing court did not explicitly address\n\nBrown\u2019s rehabilitative needs. However, the court concluded, \u201cThe problem is\n\nyou\u2019re committing crimes while you\u2019re on probation and parole. And that to\n\nme is an aggravating factor.\u201d Id., at 16. Thus, the court considered Brown\u2019s\n\nrehabilitative needs; it merely found they he had failed to be amenable to\n\nrehabilitation as evidenced by his supervision status at the time of the current\n\noffense, and prior offenses.\n\n       Further, we note that the trial court reviewed a pre-sentence report.\n\nWhere the trial court had the benefit of reviewing a pre-sentence report, we\n\nmust\n\n       presume that the sentencing judge was aware of relevant\n       information regarding the defendant\u2019s character and weighed\n       those considerations along with mitigating statutory factors. A\n       pre-sentence report constitutes the record and speaks for itself.\n       In order to dispel any lingering doubt as to our intention of\n       engaging in an effort of legal purification, we state clearly that\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\n       sentencers are under no compulsion to employ checklists or any\n       extended or systematic definitions of their punishment procedure.\n       Having been fully informed by the pre-sentence report, the\n       sentencing court\u2019s discretion should not be disturbed. This is\n       particularly true, we repeat, in those circumstances where it can\n       be demonstrated that the judge had any degree of awareness of\n       the sentencing considerations, and there we will presume also that\n       the weighing process took place in a meaningful fashion. It would\n       be foolish, indeed, to take the position that if a court is in\n       possession of the facts, it will fail to apply them to the case at\n       hand.\n\nCommonwealth v. Hallock, 603 A.2d 612, 616 (Pa. Super. 1992) (citing\n\nCommonwealth v. Devers, 546 A.2d 12, 18 (Pa. 1988)). As the trial court\n\nin this case had the benefit of a pre-sentence report2, combined with the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s explicit consideration of Brown\u2019s probationary status at the time of his\n\noffenses, the seriousness of the offense, and the impact on the victim, we\n\nconclude that it considered all relevant sentencing factors. Thus, Brown\u2019s first\n\nissue on appeal merits no relief.\n\n       In his final argument, Brown contends the trial court relied upon\n\nimpermissible factors in imposing an aggravated sentence. Specifically, he\n\nargues the trial court relied on his prior convictions and the elements of the\n\noffense in imposing an aggravated sentence. A claim that a sentencing court\n\nimposed a sentence outside the standard guidelines without stating adequate\n\nreasons on the record presents a substantial question. See Commonwealth\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2Brown did not note any changes or corrections to the pre-sentence report\nwhen given the opportunity. See N.T., Sentencing, 7/5/17, at 2.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\nv. Antidormi, 84 A.3d 736, 759 (Pa. Super. 2014) (citation omitted).\n\nTherefore, we conclude that Brown has presented a substantial question.\n\n      Brown\u2019s argument challenges the imposition of a term of imprisonment\n\nin the aggravated range of the sentencing guidelines. For such challenges, the\n\nfollowing standard of review has been set forth.\n\n      Sentencing is a matter vested in the sound discretion of the\n      sentencing judge, and a sentence will not be disturbed on appeal\n      absent a manifest abuse of discretion. In this context, an abuse\n      of discretion is not shown merely by an error in judgment. Rather,\n      the appellant must establish, by reference to the record, that the\n      sentencing court ignored or misapplied the law, exercised its\n      judgment for reasons of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill will, or\n      arrived at a manifestly unreasonable decision.\n\nCommonwealth v. Shugars, 895 A.2d 1270, 1275 (Pa. Super. 2006)\n\n(quoting Commonwealth v. Fullin, 892 A.2d 843, 847 (Pa. Super. 2006)).\n\n      It is well-established that Pennsylvania has an indeterminate guided\n\nsentencing scheme. See Commonwealth v. Yuhasz, 923 A.2d 1111, 1117\n\n(Pa. 2007). The sentencing judge is required to consider the sentencing\n\nguidelines that have been adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on\n\nSentencing. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9721(b). It is recognized however that the\n\nsentencing guidelines are purely advisory in nature and are merely one factor\n\namong many that the court must consider in imposing a sentence. See\n\nYuhasz, 923 A.2d at 1118. \u201c[A] trial court judge has wide discretion in\n\nsentencing and can, on the appropriate record and for the appropriate\n\nreasons, consider any legal factor in imposing a sentence in the aggravated\n\nrange.\u201d Shugars, 895 A.2d at 1275.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\n      It is impermissible for a court to consider factors already included\n      within the sentencing guidelines as the sole reason for increasing\n      or decreasing a sentence to the aggravated or mitigated range.\n      Trial courts are permitted to use prior conviction history and other\n      factors already included in the guidelines, if they are used to\n      supplement other extraneous sentencing information.\n\nId., at 1275 (quotation omitted).\n\n      In imposing sentence, the trial court provided the following reasoning.\n\n\n      The other victim is the prison guard, Correctional Officer\n      McGroaty. And whether Mr. Brown knew it or not, the fact of\n      throwing feces on him clearly frightened Mr. McGroaty. As a prison\n      guard you expect certain indignities, but not that. He really had\n      no connection to Mr. Brown. He happened to be the guy on shift\n      to get your food from you.\n\n      If you look at the seriousness of the crime, it\u2019s a very serious crime\n      to do that. Imagine you or anybody else, a member of your family,\n      someone came up on the street and flung feces at them, how\n      upset they would be. It\u2019s a very dangerous crime. On the danger\n      to the public, the last factor, other than the theft, but basically in\n      2011 you had a criminal trespass, 2012 a loitering, 2015\n      marijuana, 2015 receiving stolen property, 2016 identity theft,\n      2016 receiving stolen property. The problem is you\u2019re committing\n      crimes while you\u2019re on probation and parole. And that to me is an\n      aggravating factor.\n\nN.T., Sentencing, 7/5/17, at 16.\n\n      We conclude the record belies Brown\u2019s claim. First, the sentencing court\n\ndid not rely on his prior convictions as the sole reason for imposing aggravated\n\nrange sentences. While the trial court did consider Brown\u2019s prior criminal\n\nhistory in a negative light, it conditioned this consideration on the fact that\n\nBrown repeatedly committed crimes while on supervision, indicating that\n\nBrown had consistently failed to rehabilitate himself in any manner. This is a\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\ncircumstance distinct from the purely mechanical consideration of a prior\n\nrecord score. Furthermore, the trial court noted his history of committing\n\noffenses while on probation and parole to demonstrate the danger he presents\n\nthe public. That the court may not exclusively use criminal history in\n\nsentencing does not mean that it must ignore it.\n\n      As we have concluded that the court relied on permissible factors in\n\nsentencing Brown in the aggravated range, we find his contention that the\n\ncourt impermissibly relied on elements already included in the offense equally\n\nwithout merit. Although the court noted elements of the offense, they were\n\nnot the only factors relied upon in sentencing Brown in the aggravated range.\n\nFurther, the court considered the elements of the offense to demonstrate the\n\nimpact the offense had on the victim, a permissible consideration under the\n\nsentencing code. See id., at 16; See also 42 Pa. C.S.A. 9721(b).\n\n      The circumstances are certainly sufficient to justify the trial court\u2019s\n\naggravated sentence. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion, and therefore Brown\u2019s final argument merits no relief.\n\n      As we conclude none of Brown\u2019s issues on appeal merit relief, we affirm\n\nthe judgement of sentence.\n\n      Judgement of sentence affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ-S61043-18\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
