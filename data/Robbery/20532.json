Ex parte\n\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967). Applicant was convicted of robbery and\n\nsentenced to ten (10) years\u2019 imprisonment. The Second Court of Appeals dismissed his appeal. See\n\nHenderson v. State, No. 02-04-00554-CR, (Tex. App.\u2013 Fort Worth, 2005, no pet.) (not designated\n\nfor publication).\n\n       Applicant alleges that he was arrested while in Florida because the authorities erroneously\n\nbelieved that he was a person by the name of Bobby Henderson from Smith County, Texas, with an\n\f                                                                                                     2\n\noutstanding parole-revocation warrant. He alleges that he was transferred to Smith County, Texas,\n\non October 26, 2005, and confined there until February 16, 2006, when he was transferred to Wichita\n\nCounty. Applicant seeks credit for the period of time he was confined in Smith County.\n\n         On October 29, 2008, this Court remanded this application so that the record could be\n\nsupplemented with more evidence. In response to this Court\u2019s remand order, the trial judge\n\nsupplemented the record with inter alia affidavits from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice,\n\nthe Florida Department of Corrections, and the Wichita County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The trial\n\njudge has entered findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending that relief be granted. We\n\nagree.\n\n         Applicant is entitled to credit for the time that he was confined in Smith County. The Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice shall credit Applicant\u2019s sentence in cause number 40,993-B from\n\nthe 78th District Court of Wichita County with 114 days jail time credit.\n\n         Copies of this opinion will be sent to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional\n\nand Pardons and Paroles Divisions.\n\n\n\nFiled: April 1, 2009\nDo not publish\n\f",
