Factual and Procedural Background\r\n\r\nIn\r\nDecember 2006, Texas City Police Department (ATCPD@) officer Salvador Chapa was\r\ndispatched to a local gameroom to investigate a robbery call.\u00a0 The two suspects\r\nin the robbery were described as black males.\u00a0 At appellant=s trial, Chapa testified that he saw\r\ntwo black males walking near the gameroom and initiated contact with them.\u00a0 He\r\nidentified himself as a police officer and told them he was investigating a\r\nnearby robbery.\u00a0 One of the men, identified later that evening as appellant,\r\nimmediately ran from Chapa.\u00a0 Chapa pursued appellant, but lost him during the\r\nchase.\u00a0 According to Chapa, while he was chasing appellant, Chapa saw him throw\r\nsomething into a Abushy area@ near an apartment complex.\u00a0 Chapa also saw that appellant\r\nlost a shoe during the chase.\u00a0 Chapa explained that, after losing appellant in\r\nthe apartment complex, he returned to the area where he had seen appellant\r\nthrow an object into the bushes and lose his shoe; Chapa recovered a .380\r\ncaliber pistol and a blue Nike tennis shoe, both of which were entered into\r\nevidence at appellant=s trial.\u00a0 Chapa testified that he and other TCPD officers set\r\nup a Aperimeter area@ around the apartment complex in\r\nwhich Chapa had lost sight of appellant.\u00a0 They also called in a K-9 unit to\r\nassist in the search for appellant.\r\n\r\nShortly\r\nafterwards, officers became involved in a family disturbance at one of the\r\napartments.\u00a0 Appellant, wearing one blue Nike tennis shoe and a Ahouse shoe,@ approached one of the officers who\r\nwas investigating the family disturbance.\u00a0 This officer radioed Chapa, who\r\nproceeded to the scene of the disturbance; Chapa identified appellant as the\r\nindividual who had fled from him.\u00a0\u00a0 Appellant was arrested.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nTCPD\r\ncaptain Brian Goetschius questioned appellant the day after his arrest.\u00a0\r\nAppellant signed the following voluntary statement, which was read to the jury\r\nand admitted into evidence in written form:\r\n\r\nQ. [by Goetschius]:\u00a0\u00a0 OK, last night you were\r\narrested.\u00a0 Just prior to being arrested did you possess a handgun?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. [by appellant]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\r\n\r\nQ.:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OK, what type handgun did you possess and why did you have\r\nit?\r\n\r\nA.:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 . . . I had a 380, it was for my own protection man,,,see\r\n[sic], I am a felon, anybody that been on parole aint [sic] supposed to have no\r\ngun man.\u00a0 They said they pulled me over for a . . . robbery at the game room.\r\n\r\nQ.:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OK, when the police first stopped you did you run because you\r\nhad the handgun on you?\r\n\r\nA.:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That=s the only reason I ran, he told me he wanted to talk\r\nabout a . . . robbery,,, [sic] how that gonna look?\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nQ.:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you throw the handgun away before the police finally\r\narrested you?\r\n\r\nA.:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I threw it in some bushes.\r\n\r\nAt\r\nappellant=s trial, the State provided evidence regarding a prior final felony\r\nconviction of appellant from June 2004.\u00a0 The jury found appellant guilty as\r\ncharged in the indictment.\u00a0 Appellant pleaded Atrue@ to an enhancement paragraph, and the\r\ntrial court sentenced him to five years= confinement in the Texas Department\r\nof Criminal Justice, Institutional Division.\u00a0 This appeal timely ensued.\r\n\r\nII.\u00a0 Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\n\r\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Standard of Review and\r\nApplicable Law\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen\r\nreviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we do not ask whether we\r\nbelieve the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Jackson\r\nv. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318B19 (1979).\u00a0 Rather, we examine all\r\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether\r\nany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\r\noffense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Id. at 319; Mason v. State,\r\n905 S.W.2d 570, 574 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (en banc).\u00a0 Although we consider all\r\nevidence presented at trial, we may not re\u2011weigh the evidence and\r\nsubstitute our judgment for that of the jury.\u00a0 King v. State, 29 S.W.3d\r\n556, 562 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (en banc).\u00a0 In other words, the jury is the\r\nexclusive judge of the credibility of witnesses and of the weight to be given\r\ntheir testimony, and it is the exclusive province of the jury to reconcile\r\nconflicts in the evidence.\u00a0 Wesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 111 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 2000) (en banc).\u00a0 Our review of the evidence includes both properly\r\nand improperly admitted evidence.\u00a0 Clayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\u00a0 We consider both direct and circumstantial evidence,\r\nand all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom in making our\r\ndetermination.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant\r\nwas charged with the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.\u00a0 Tex. Penal Code Ann. ' 46.04(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2008).\u00a0 To\r\nconvict appellant, the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat appellant was previously convicted of a felony offense and possessed a\r\nfirearm after that conviction and before the fifth anniversary of his release\r\nfrom confinement or from community supervision or parole, whichever was later.\u00a0\r\nId.; see also Hawkins v. State, 89 S.W.3d 674, 677 (Tex. App.CHouston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. ref=d).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\nhas not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence establishing his prior\r\nfelony conviction or the timing of his five-year anniversary from that\r\nconviction.\u00a0 He has only challenged the legal sufficiency of the evidence\r\nshowing that he possessed a firearm.\u00a0 But, as noted above, appellant confessed\r\nto this aspect of the offense: he acknowledged that he had a .380 caliber\r\nhandgun when he ran away from Chapa.\u00a0 In fact, he stated that the only reason\r\nhe ran from the officer was because he knew he was not supposed to carry a\r\ngun.\u00a0 He further explained that he threw the gun into some bushes when he was\r\nrunning from Chapa.\u00a0 Finally, Chapa described seeing appellant throw an object\r\ninto a bushy area and then recovered a .380 caliber handgun from that area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViewing\r\nthis evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that a\r\nrational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nappellant committed the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.\r\nWe therefore overrule appellant=s issue.\r\n\r\nIII.\u00a0 Conclusion\r\n\r\nHaving\r\ndetermined that legally sufficient evidence supports appellant=s conviction, we overrule his sole\r\nissue on appeal and affirm the trial court=s judgment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n/s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eva M.
