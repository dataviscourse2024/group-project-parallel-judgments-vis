Following an evidentiary\nhearing, the post-conviction court denied relief. On appeal, petitioner argues that he received\nineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel: (1) failed to challenge the value of the\nstolen goods and (2) failed to seek a continuance after the State filed a late notice of intent\nto seek enhanced punishment.

Facts\n\n                                    A. Facts from Trial\n\n      In our opinion disposing of petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, this court summarized the facts\nfrom petitioner\u2019s trial on June 12, 2009, as follows:\n\n               Eugene Grinder, the victim in this case, owns property in Perry County,\n       Tennessee. About eight years before trial, Mr. Grinder purchased about 5,000\n       feet of six-foot wire fencing in seventy-two, irregular-sized rolls. Some of the\n       rolls were bigger, and some were smaller. He paid $3,000 for the fencing. He\n       left the wire fencing outside on this property. In January 2008, someone called\n       the victim and told him they found a roll of the wire fencing. When he arrived\n       at his property, the victim discovered that the majority of the wire fencing had\n       been taken and just a few pieces of it were left.\n\n               Christopher Reeves, Appellant\u2019s co-defendant, testified that he was\n       incarcerated at the time of trial. He stated that in January 2008, he and\n       Appellant stole rolls of wire fencing from a property in Perry County. The two\n       men loaded some of the wire into a truck. Mr. Reeves did not know what\n       happened to the wire fencing because he returned home after loading it. The\n       two men returned and loaded up more wire fencing into a red Chevy pick-up\n       truck they borrowed from Herbert Dell Potter. On their way to Mr. Potter\u2019s\n       house, the truck broke down. After the truck was repaired, they returned to\n       Mr. Potter\u2019s house with the wire fencing. Mr. Potter was living with Kelly\n       Pilatti at the time. The wire fencing was sold to Heather Georges and Trade\n       Time, a local radio show.\n\n               Mr. Potter and his wife, Kelly Potter, recalled that Appellant borrowed\n       Mr. Potter\u2019s pick-up truck in January 2008. When Appellant returned with the\n       truck, the back of the truck was filled with twenty-five to thirty rolls of wire\n       fencing about six feet high. The wire fencing was rusty. Appellant told Mr.\n       Potter that the wire fencing was left over from a job erecting a fence. Mr.\n       Potter and his wife admitted that they did not know where Appellant obtained\n       the wire.\n\n              Lewis County Sheriff\u2019s Sergeant Tommy Franzen was informed that\n       wire fencing had been stolen from Mr. Grinder\u2019s property. He went to the\n\n                                             -2-\n\f      victim\u2019s property and saw that some wire was still there. He contacted scrap\n      metal places to see if anyone had attempted to sell any wire fencing. He was\n      sent to the Pilatti\u2019s residence. There Sergeant Franzen discovered twenty-one\n      rolls of wire fencing. Mr. Grinder identified the rolls as belonging to him.\n      While there, he spoke with Mr. Pilatti and both of the Potters. Appellant and\n      his co-defendant were brought into the sheriff\u2019s department for another reason,\n      and Sergeant Franzen interviewed them about the wire fencing. Appellant told\n      Sergeant Franzen he bought the wire fencing at a store for $85 a roll.\n\n              Heather Georges was a close friend of Appellant. She recalled that she\n      purchased a few rolls of wire fencing from Appellant in late December 2007\n      or early January 2008. She purchased the wire fencing for use in her dog\n      breeding business. When she returned from a dog show in Georgia, the wire\n      fencing had been delivered. The wire fencing was rusty[,] and the rolls were\n      all different sizes. On January 22, 2008, the police questioned her regarding\n      her purchase of the wire fencing. When she learned it had been stolen, she\n      gave it to the authorities.\n\n             Joey Holt heard an advertisement for wire fencing on the Trade Time\n      radio program. He purchased some wire for $25 a roll in January 2008. After\n      he saw a newspaper article regarding wire fencing similar to that he purchased,\n      he contacted the authorities. The sheriff\u2019s department took the wire.\n\n             On January 24, 2008, Perry County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Mike Chandler\n      was contacted by the Lewis County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The Lewis County\n      Sheriff\u2019s Department provided the results of their investigation into the stolen\n      wire fencing to Detective Mike Chandler. As a result, Detective Chandler\n      obtained warrants for Appellant\u2019s arrest.\n\n             The Perry County Grand Jury indicted Appellant for one count of theft\n      over $1,000. At the conclusion of a jury trial held on June 12, 2009, Appellant\n      was found guilty as charged. The trial court sentenced Appellant to twelve\n      years as a career offender. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\nState v. Billy D. Sizemore, No. M2009-01827-CCA-R3-CD, 2011 WL 345854, at *1-2 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Jan. 31, 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\f                               B. Facts from Post-Conviction Hearing\n\n        At the February 15, 2013 hearing,1 petitioner testified that he met with trial counsel\nthree times prior to trial. He stated that trial counsel told him that \u201cthe case carried four\nyears.\u201d Petitioner also identified a notice to seek an enhanced punishment and asserted that\nhe did not see this document until he \u201cgot all of [trial counsel\u2019s] papers from [appellate\ncounsel].\u201d Petitioner explained that while the document had been filed on June 12, 2009, he\ndid not see the document before his trial. He asserted that trial counsel never explained that\nthe State planned to seek an enhanced punishment if petitioner was convicted. Petitioner\naverred that if he had known he was going to receive twelve years instead of four years, he\nmay have pleaded guilty instead of going to trial. Petitioner also identified a Perry County\nSheriff\u2019s Department incident report and explained that the report stated that the value of the\nstolen wire was seven dollars each and that sixty-four rolls of wire were found, which\naltogether totaled $448. Petitioner testified that trial counsel never showed him this\ndocument prior to trial. Petitioner stated that trial counsel never argued that the State\u2019s\nvaluation of the fencing was incorrect and never cross-examined the investigating officer or\nthe victim about the value of the wire.\n\n        During cross-examination, petitioner asserted that his trial strategy was to prove his\ninnocence but that if he had known he would be sentenced as a career offender, he might\nhave considered a plea agreement for four years. Petitioner conceded that he received a copy\nof his criminal history as part of discovery but asserted that trial counsel did not tell him that\nhis nine prior felonies could be used to enhance his sentence. Petitioner acknowledged that\ntrial counsel filed a motion asking for a jury instruction regarding the jury\u2019s ability to\ndetermine the value of the wire fencing.\n\n       Trial counsel testified next that he had been an attorney since 2004 and primarily\npracticed juvenile, domestic, and criminal law. He stated that he was appointed to represent\npetitioner in general sessions and circuit court. Trial counsel explained that he requested and\nreceived discovery in petitioner\u2019s case. Although he did not specifically remember\ndiscussing petitioner\u2019s criminal history with petitioner, he said his normal practice was to\nreview each conviction in the criminal history with his client and then explain the possible\nrange of punishment using a chart. Trial counsel testified that he did not know if he actually\nused the words career offender but that he informed petitioner that \u201cif found guilty, he would\nbe doing a lot more than five years.\u201d Trial counsel explained that at the three office meetings\nwith petitioner, they would have discussed petitioner\u2019s innocence and the trial strategy. His\n\n\n        1\n          Petitioner has abandoned several of the issues he raised in the post-conviction court on appeal;\ntherefore, our recitation of the facts from the post-conviction hearing will be limited to the issues raised on\nappeal.\n\n                                                     -4-\n\ftrial strategy was to show that all the evidence, other than the co-defendant\u2019s testimony, was\ncircumstantial and that there was no proof that the wire in petitioner\u2019s possession was the\nsame wire that was stolen. He explained that the value of the wire did not affect their\nstrategy to prove innocence and that he requested the special jury instruction on value so that\nthe jury could consider it. However, the main focus was on petitioner\u2019s innocence. Trial\ncounsel acknowledged that he filed several motions in limine regarding petitioner\u2019s prior\nconvictions.\n\n       During cross-examination, trial counsel agreed that determining the value of stolen\ngoods is important when handling a theft case because the value determines the possible\nlength of punishment. Trial counsel did not remember cross-examining the victim or the\ninvestigating officer about the value of the stolen wire. He also did not remember reading\nthe incident report in this case but asserted that if it was produced in discovery, he read it.\nTrial counsel conceded that there was a disparity between the victim\u2019s testimony and the\nincident report regarding the value of the stolen wire and that he did not file a motion to\ndismiss based on the disparity.\n\n        After hearing this testimony, the trial court denied post-conviction relief, finding that\ntrial counsel had informed petitioner of his sentencing exposure and that \u201ceven though [trial\ncounsel] may not have specific recollection [of] it, the Court accepts his statement of his\nroutine practice.\u201d The court also stated:\n\n       It\u2019s difficult for the Court, in some regard, to determine whether an attorney\n       has specifically advised a client on a fairly detailed issue, such as a notice of\n       enhancement.\n\n       ....\n\n              The Court, again, believes that in this particular case, there is enough\n       to convince the Court that that was provided to Mr. Sizemore. That even\n       though [trial counsel] may not have specific recollection [of] it, the Court\n       accepts his statement of his routine practice. In this case, he filed numerous\n       motions addressing the previous convictions . . . that the defendant had. It\n       would be outside the realm of logic that [trial counsel] would file all of these\n       motions relating to the use of the defendant\u2019s criminal record at trial, but not\n       advise the defendant that the prior convictions could be used against him.\n\n               Respectfully to the defendant, the Court finds it very difficult to believe\n       that the defendant, just in a common sense framework, would not believe that\n       his own record, his own extensive criminal record, could be used against him\n\n                                               -5-\n\f       for purposes of the sentencing. This defendant is no stranger to the court\n       proceedings, and it would again defy the Court\u2019s logic to some degree to\n       believe that the defendant was caught by surprise that his previous felony\n       convictions could actually be used against him. Again, that\u2019s a very\n       disingenuous type of statement to make[,] and the Court doesn\u2019t accept it.\n\n       ....\n\n                The biggest issue . . . is did [trial counsel] make enough of the issue as\n       it relates to the value of the property. That one particular point could give the\n       Court considerable pause with regard to this proceeding if I believe that [trial\n       counsel] just let a fairly important issue such as valuation slide by him. . . . We\n       did hear evidence of all sorts and all types as to the valuation of this property.\n       [Trial counsel] questioned witnesses, to some regard, with regard to the\n       property. With some regard, he didn\u2019t have to. It was being brought out by the\n       State. And secondly, the Court agrees with the State that this wasn\u2019t the main\n       defense that [trial counsel] was proceeding on. His defense wasn\u2019t valuation\n       of property. His defense was Mr. Sizemore didn\u2019t do it, he had nothing to do\n       with it.\n\n               It is difficult from an attorney\u2019s perspective to argue alternative theories\n       of innocence to a jury. And as a matter of trial strategy, [trial counsel] moved\n       forward with the theory that his client was innocent of the charge completely\n       and focused in on that. My court\u2019s not going to go behind [trial counsel] and\n       try to determine what trial strategy was more appropriate. The fact is, is that\n       he made that decision. And he made that decision upon consulting his client.\n       And the Court believes that that decision was reasonable.\n\n                                          II. Analysis\n\n        Petitioner argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel\nfailed to challenge the value of the stolen goods and failed to seek a continuance after the\nState filed a late notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment. The State responds that the\npost-conviction court properly denied the petition for post-conviction relief. We agree with\nthe State.\n\n                                    A. Standard of Review\n\n        To obtain relief in a post-conviction proceeding, a petitioner must demonstrate that\nhis or her \u201cconviction or sentence is void or voidable because of the abridgement of any right\n\n                                               -6-\n\fguaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee or the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Tenn.\nCode Ann. \u00a7 40-30-103. A post-conviction petitioner bears the burden of proving his or her\nfactual allegations by clear and convincing evidence. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-110(f).\n\u201c\u2018Evidence is clear and convincing when there is no serious or substantial doubt about the\ncorrectness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence.\u2019\u201d Lane v. State, 316 S.W.3d 555,\n562 (Tenn. 2010) (quoting Grindstaff v. State, 297 S.W.3d 208, 216 (Tenn. 2009)).\n\n        Appellate courts do not reassess the trial court\u2019s determination of the credibility of\nwitnesses. Dellinger v. State, 279 S.W.3d 282, 292 (Tenn. 2009) (citing R.D.S. v. State, 245\nS.W.3d 356, 362 (Tenn. 2008)). Assessing the credibility of witnesses is a matter entrusted\nto the trial judge as the trier of fact. R.D.S., 245 S.W.3d at 362 (quoting State v. Odom, 928\nS.W.2d 18, 23 (Tenn. 1996)). The post-conviction court\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive on\nappeal unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise. Berry v. State, 366 S.W.3d\n160, 169 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2011) (citing Henley v. State, 960 S.W.2d 572, 578-79 (Tenn.\n1997); Bates v. State, 973 S.W.2d 615, 631 (Tenn. Crim. App.1997)). However, conclusions\nof law receive no presumption of correctness on appeal. Id. (citing Fields v. State, 40 S.W.3d\n450, 453 (Tenn. 2001)). As a mixed question of law and fact, this court\u2019s review of\npetitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims is de novo with no presumption of\ncorrectness. Felts v. State, 354 S.W.3d 266, 276 (Tenn. 2011) (citations omitted).\n\n        The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, and article I, section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution\nrequire that a criminal defendant receive effective assistance of counsel. Cauthern v. State,\n145 S.W.3d 571, 598 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2004) (citing Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930\n(Tenn. 1975)). When a petitioner claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel,\nhe must demonstrate both that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency\nprejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Finch v. State,\n226 S.W.3d 307, 315 (Tenn. 2007) (citation omitted). It follows that if this court holds that\neither prong is not met, we are not compelled to consider the other prong. Carpenter v. State,\n126 S.W.3d 879, 886 (Tenn. 2004).\n\n       To prove that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, petitioner must establish that his\nattorney\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of \u201c\u2018reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.\u2019\u201d Finch, 226 S.W.3d at 315 (quoting Vaughn v. State, 202 S.W.3d 106,\n116 (Tenn. 2006)). As our supreme court held:\n\n       \u201c[T]he assistance of counsel required under the Sixth Amendment is counsel\n       reasonably likely to render and rendering reasonably effective assistance. It is\n       a violation of this standard for defense counsel to deprive a criminal defendant\n       of a substantial defense by his own ineffectiveness or incompetence. . . .\n\n                                             -7-\n\f       Defense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary\n       training and skill in the criminal law and must conscientiously protect his\n       client\u2019s interest, undeflected by conflicting considerations.\u201d\n\nId. at 315-16 (quoting Baxter, 523 S.W.2d at 934-35). On appellate review of trial counsel\u2019s\nperformance, this court \u201cmust make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of\nhindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s conduct, and to evaluate the conduct\nfrom the perspective of counsel at that time.\u201d Howell v. State, 185 S.W.3d 319, 326 (Tenn.\n2006) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689).\n\n         To prove that petitioner suffered prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s deficient\nperformance, he \u201cmust establish a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Vaughn, 202 S.W.3d at 116 (citing\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694). \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). As such,\npetitioner must establish that his attorney\u2019s deficient performance was of such magnitude that\nhe was deprived of a fair trial and that the reliability of the outcome was called into question.\nFinch, 226 S.W.3d at 316 (citing State v. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453, 463 (Tenn. 1999)).\n\n                                  B. Value of Stolen Goods\n\n         The post-conviction court concluded that trial counsel\u2019s conduct at trial was\nreasonable based on the trial strategy. This determination is supported by the record. While\nvalue is an important issue in a theft case, trial counsel proceeded on a theory of innocence\nat trial and properly challenged the State\u2019s evidence in that regard. Trial counsel explained\nthat the value of the wire did not affect the strategy to prove innocence and that he requested\nthe special jury instruction on value so that the jury could consider it. However, the main\nfocus was on petitioner\u2019s innocence.\n\n       On appellate review of trial counsel\u2019s performance, this court \u201cmust make every effort\nto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s\nconduct, and to evaluate the conduct from the perspective of counsel at that time.\u201d Howell,\n185 S.W.3d at 326 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). Furthermore, this court gives\ndeference to matters of trial strategy as long as the strategy is based on informed and\nadequate representation. Hellard v. State, 629 S.W.2d 4, 9 (Tenn. 1982). Trial counsel\nproceeded on a valid and sound trial strategy of innocence, and we determine that, in this\ncontext, his failure to rely on the incident report for valuation did not fall below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness under the prevailing professional norms. In addition, the trial\ncourt also stated, and the trial transcripts reflect, that the court heard evidence \u201cof all sorts\nand all types as to the valuation of this property.\u201d The jury was also instructed as follows:\n\n                                               -8-\n\f               The State has the burden of proving this value beyond a reasonable\n        doubt, as defined in these instructions.\n\n                The jury will fix the value of property or services obtained, along with\n        its verdict, by indicating which of the following ranges the value falls within:\n\n                 (1) $1,000 or more, but less than $10,000; or\n\n                 (2) more than $500, but less than $1,000; or\n\n                 (3) $500 or less.\n\nTherefore, petitioner has failed to show that even if the value had been challenged, there is\na reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different. Petitioner\nis without relief as to this issue.\n\n                                 C. Notice of Enhanced Punishment\n\n       Petitioner also argues that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to request\na continuance after the State filed a late notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment.\nSpecifically, he argues that the notice was ambiguous because the title had the words\n\u201cMultiple Offender\u201d whereas the body of the notice stated \u201cCareer offender\u201d and that,\nfurthermore, because of the late filing, counsel never informed petitioner that he might be\nsentenced as a career offender.2 However, the post-conviction court concluded that petitioner\nwas \u201cno stranger to the court proceedings, and it would again defy the Court\u2019s logic to some\ndegree to believe that the defendant was caught by surprise that his previous felony\nconvictions could actually be used against him.\u201d The court also determined that trial counsel\nhad advised petitioner of his sentencing exposure because it would defy logic that trial\ncounsel would file numerous motions to limit the use of petitioner\u2019s prior convictions at trial\nyet not inform petitioner of his sentencing exposure due to those same convictions.\nFurthermore, although he did not specifically remember discussing petitioner\u2019s criminal\nhistory with petitioner, he said his normal practice was to review each conviction in the\n\n\n        2\n          We note that petitioner has reframed this issue on appeal. In the post-conviction court, petitioner\nargued that due to the late notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment, trial counsel did not properly advise\npetitioner of his sentencing exposure as a career offender. It is only on appeal that petitioner argues that it\nwas ineffective for trial counsel not to file a motion to continue. However, instead of waiving this issue\naltogether, we will address the underlying issue of whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\nproperly advise petitioner of his sentencing exposure because the issue essentially rests on the same grounds\nregardless of its presentation.\n\n                                                     -9-\n\fcriminal history with his client and then explain the possible range of punishment using a\nchart. Trial counsel also testified that he did not know if he actually used the words career\noffender but that he informed petitioner that \u201cif found guilty, he would be doing a lot more\nthan five years.\u201d\n\n       To prove that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, petitioner must establish that his\nattorney\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of \u201c\u2018reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.\u2019\u201d Finch, 226 S.W.3d at 315 (quoting Vaughn, 202 S.W.3d at 116).\nEven if the notice of enhancement was ambiguous, petitioner has failed to show trial counsel\nwas deficient because petitioner was well aware of his nine prior felony convictions and\nbecause trial counsel had previously explained petitioner\u2019s sentencing exposure. Petitioner\nis without relief as to this issue.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n      Based on the parties\u2019 arguments, the record, and the applicable law, we affirm the\njudgment of the post-conviction court.\n\n\n                                                   _________________________________\n                                                   ROGER A.
