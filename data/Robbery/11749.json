AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n      Laura Lockwood of Lockwood Law Firm, P.L.L.C., Des Moines, for\n\nappellant.\n\n      Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, Mary A. Triick, Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, John P. Sarcone, County Attorney, and Michael Hunter, Assistant\n\nCounty Attorney, for appellee State.\n\n\n\n      Considered by Danilson, C.J., and Vaitheswaran and Mullins, JJ.\n\nMcDonald, J., takes no part.\n\f                                           2\n\n\nVAITHESWARAN, J.\n\n        The State charged Ramon Price with two counts of first-degree robbery\n\nand two counts of second-degree robbery in connection with thefts from two Des\n\nMoines stores. A jury found Price guilty of one count of first-degree robbery and\n\ntwo counts of second-degree robbery.1 Price appealed, raising a challenge to\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence and the district court\u2019s assessment of a surcharge.\n\nState v. Price, No. 07-1450, 2008 WL 5412322, at *1-2 (Iowa Ct. App. Dec. 31,\n\n2008). This court affirmed Price\u2019s convictions, and vacated the surcharge. See\n\nid. at *2.\n\n        Price filed an application for postconviction relief, raising several\n\nineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims.       The district court denied\n\nPrice\u2019s application following a hearing.\n\n        On appeal, Price contends his direct-appeal attorney was ineffective in\n\nfailing to challenge (1) the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to replace his trial\n\nattorney, (2) the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to sever the first-degree\n\nrobbery count from one of the remaining counts, and (3) the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting the first-degree robbery count. To prove his claims, he must\n\nestablish a breach of an essential duty and prejudice.             See Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).\n\nI.      Substitution of Trial Counsel\n\n        \u201cWhere a defendant represented by a court-appointed attorney requests\n\nthe court appoint substitute counsel, sufficient cause must be shown to justify\n\n\n1\n  The court dismissed one of the second-degree robbery counts and submitted one of\nthe first-degree robbery counts to the jury as second-degree robbery.\n\f                                        3\n\nreplacement.\u201d State v. Tejeda, 677 N.W.2d 744, 749-50 (Iowa 2004). \u201cSufficient\n\ncause includes a conflict of interest, irreconcilable conflict, or a complete\n\nbreakdown in communication between the attorney and the defendant.\u201d State v.\n\nLopez, 633 N.W.2d 774, 778 (Iowa 2001).\n\n      Price filed two motions to replace his attorney. He withdrew the second\n\nmotion after telling the judge he wished \u201cto keep\u201d his attorney and he did not \u201csee\n\nany reason why\u201d they should separate. To the extent Price now cites reasons\n\nsupporting the second motion, we decline to consider them.\n\n      Price\u2019s first motion sought the replacement of counsel \u201cdue to overload of\n\ncases and lack of proper counsel and advice.\u201d Price was given an opportunity to\n\nexplain his concerns at a hearing on his motion. See Tejeda, 677 N.W.2d at 750\n\n(stating if a defendant requests substitute counsel on the basis of a breakdown in\n\ncommunication with the attorney, a district court has a duty to inquire into the\n\nnature of the breakdown.). He stated:\n\n               Okay. Basically, it\u2019s really nothing against [defense counsel]\n      or anything, but I just believe he\u2019s kind of overloaded on cases, for\n      say, you know, my particular charges. You know, I\u2019m\u2014you know, I\n      got a lot of charges here. It\u2019s very serious and I\u2014you know, I\n      haven\u2019t really had adequate time or counsel with him. Through my\n      stay here in Polk County for maybe the last three and a half months\n      I\u2019ve only spoken with him, like, one time, you know, and the second\n      time was just to fill out a form.\n               But, you know, basically, you know, he\u2019s\u2014he seems to be\n      too busy, you know. And like I said it\u2019s really nothing against him,\n      it\u2019s just I need somebody that\u2019s going to really be there for me and\n      give me the time for the advice that I need.\n\nPrice\u2019s attorney responded to these concerns as follows:\n\n             I did meet with Mr. Price on February 28th at the jail. At that\n      time we discussed the possibility of raising a psychiatric defense of\n      diminished capacity or intoxication. I went back to the jail the\n\f                                          4\n\n\n       following Friday to have him sign the waivers for Broadlawns\n       Medical Center and, I believe, Methodist Hospital.\n               I\u2019ve sent for all of his medical and psychiatric records from\n       both of those institutions. I\u2019m also trying to get him evaluated by a\n       psychiatrist, but there\u2019s a limited number of psychiatrists who do\n       those evaluations, and there\u2019s\u2014I personally have three clients that\n       I\u2019m trying to get in for evaluations, and there\u2019s other attorneys in the\n       same situation.\n               So it\u2019s going to take some time to get that evaluation done.\n       We do have depositions set of, I believe, 13 of the State\u2019s\n       witnesses. Those depositions are set for March 30th. So I feel that\n       the case is proceeding normally given the severity of the charges,\n       four counts, two robbery in the first degree and two robbery in the\n       second degree. And particularly with the possibility of a psychiatric\n       defense involved, I feel I\u2019m doing everything that needs to be done\n       in this case.\n\nThe district court concluded Price\u2019s attorney was \u201cdiligently pursuing\u201d the case.\n\nThe court denied the motion for substitute counsel.\n\n       The district court essentially made a discretionary decision that Price\n\nfailed to establish sufficient cause for replacing his attorney. See State v. Boggs,\n\n741 N.W.2d 492, 506 (Iowa 2007) (noting the trial court \u201chas considerable\n\ndiscretion whether to grant substitute counsel\u201d). On our de novo review, we\n\nconclude Price\u2019s appellate attorney did not breach an essential duty in failing to\n\nchallenge this discretionary ruling.\n\nII.    Joinder of Counts\n\n       Before trial, Price filed a motion to sever the four counts of the trial\n\ninformation for four separate trials. Following a hearing, the district court ordered\n\nthe two first-degree robbery counts to be tried together \u201cbased on the similarity of\n\ncircumstances and the closeness in time.\u201d The court ordered separate trials for\n\neach of the two second-degree robbery counts.\n\f                                          5\n\n\n       Price claims his appellate attorney was ineffective in failing to challenge\n\nthe district court\u2019s refusal to sever the first two counts. On our de novo review,\n\nwe disagree.\n\n       Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.6(1) permits the joint prosecution of\n\nmultiple charges that are a part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan.\u201d According to the\n\nminutes of testimony, the State intended to prove that two Family Dollar stores\n\non the east and south sides of Des Moines were robbed within a day of each\n\nother. A witness at the scene of the first robbery saw a man with a goatee, black\n\nstocking cap, and stained hooded sweatshirt leaving the store. The following\n\nday, the witness was listening to his police scanner when he heard a broadcast\n\nof a second robbery. He went to the site of that robbery and positively identified\n\na man as the same person he saw at the location of the first robbery. Clerks at\n\nboth stores would testify that the person\u2019s outerwear was stained. The clerk at\n\nthe second store would also confirm that the person who robbed the store had a\n\ngoatee. Price\u2019s sister-in-law was slated to testify that, on the day of the second\n\nrobbery, Price gave her $200 in cash towards rent. She would opine that it was\n\nunusual for him to have cash with him. These minutes establish a common\n\nscheme or plan.\n\n       On our de novo review of the record, we conclude Price\u2019s appellate\n\nattorney did not breach an essential duty in failing to challenge the district court\u2019s\n\ndiscretionary severance ruling. See State v. Neiderbach, 837 N.W.2d 180, 190\n\n(Iowa 2013) (reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to sever for abuse of\n\ndiscretion).\n\f                                          6\n\n\nIII.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Price claims his appellate attorney was ineffective in failing to claim \u201cthe\n\nevidence was insufficient to prove the knives found on Price\u2019s person were used\n\nin the robberies.\u201d The State makes two responses.\n\n       First, the State argues that Price raised this argument in his direct appeal\n\nand is foreclosed from re-litigating it in the postconviction proceeding.      We\n\ndisagree. Price\u2019s appellate attorney challenged the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting a finding that the knife he wielded was a dangerous weapon. Now,\n\nPrice asserts there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he used\n\nknives in the robbery. This is a different issue.\n\n       Second, the State questions Price\u2019s reference to \u201cknives\u201d and \u201crobberies.\u201d\n\nThe State points out that only first-degree robbery requires proof of weapon use\n\nand Price was found guilty of only one count of first-degree robbery. We agree.\n\nOn the single first-degree robbery count on which the jury rendered a finding of\n\nguilt, we must determine \u201cif the record reveals substantial evidence.\u201d State v.\n\nTruesdell, 679 N.W.2d 611, 616 (Iowa 2004). If it does, \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to raise\n\nthe claim of error could not be prejudicial.\u201d Id.\n\n       The jury was instructed the State would have to prove several elements of\n\nfirst-degree robbery including that \u201c[t]he defendant was armed with a dangerous\n\nweapon.\u201d The jury was further instructed, \u201cTo go \u2018armed\u2019 means the defendant\n\nwas aware of the weapon and it was in a place where it was readily accessible to\n\nthe defendant or someone he aided and abetted.\u201d\n\n       A jury could have found that one of the store clerks saw Price \u201cstanding\n\nright next to [her]\u201d while \u201cholding\u201d \u201ca small blade of a knife.\u201d This amounts to\n\f                                          7\n\n\nsubstantial evidence in support of a finding that Price was armed at the time of\n\nthe robbery.    Because substantial evidence supports this element, Price\u2019s\n\nappellate attorney was not ineffective in failing to challenge the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence.\n\n       We affirm the denial of Price\u2019s application for postconviction relief.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f",
