SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judge:\n        This case presents an issue of first impression for our court. Is a federal\nemployee, even one whose job it is to investigate fraud, a \u201cperson\u201d under the\nFalse Claims Act such that he may maintain a qui tam action? We disagree with\nthe district court and conclude that there is no basis to except such an employee\nfrom personhood. A second question is whether the Act\u2019s \u201cpublic disclosure bar\u201d\nis an impediment to this suit. The district court determined that this bar\n\f   Case: 11-20320      Document: 00511940318      Page: 2   Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                    No. 11-20320\n\napplied but used an overly broad conception of the bar. We REVERSE and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n      In early 2006, relators Randall Little and Joel Arnold filed two qui tam\nsuits against Shell in the Western District of Oklahoma. They alleged that Shell\nhad defrauded the U.S. Department of the Interior of at least $19 million.\nSpecifically, they charged that from October 2001 through 2005, Shell had\ndeprived the United States of royalties by taking unauthorized deductions for\nexpenses to gather and store oil on twelve of its offshore drilling platforms.\n      At the time their suits were filed, Little was a Senior Auditor and Arnold\na Supervisory Auditor for the Minerals Management Service (MMS), an agency\nwithin the Department of the Interior that administered Shell\u2019s leases.1 Part of\nMMS\u2019s mission was to uncover theft or fraud in the royalty programs. Little\nreported the information he uncovered to Arnold, his immediate supervisor, and\nthe two furnished it to their mutual superior, Lonnie Kimball. It is undisputed\nthat the Shell allegations came to light during the course of their official duties\nand that reporting their findings to Kimball was a job requirement. It is also\nundisputed that this information was conveyed before the filings of the qui tam\nactions. To their knowledge, neither MMS nor any other federal agency has ever\nacted on this information.\n      Special procedures apply to qui tam suits under the False Claims Act.\nThey are suits brought \u201cfor the person and for the United States Government.\u201d\n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1). Before a defendant is served, the relator must provide\nthe complaint and \u201csubstantially all material evidence and information\u201d he has\nto the United States. \u00a7 3730(b)(2). The case remains under seal for 60 days.\nThe government may intervene in the litigation and then prosecute the action\n\n\n      1\n          Governmental reorganizations have eliminated the MMS.\n\n                                           2\n\f     Case: 11-20320    Document: 00511940318      Page: 3   Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                    No. 11-20320\n\nitself, or move to have it dismissed. \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A). The court may grant\ndismissal \u201cnotwithstanding the objections\u201d of relators.            Id.   Should the\ngovernment intervene and continue the suit, the relators receive between 10 and\n25 percent of any judgment, whereas their share rises to between 25 and 30\npercent if the United States declines participation. \u00a7 3730(d)(1), (2).\n        These procedures were followed. After the government notified the court\nit did not wish to intervene, the court ordered the case to be unsealed and the\ndefendants to be served. The cases were transferred from Oklahoma to the\nSouthern District of Texas on March 2, 2007, and consolidated there by the\nparties\u2019 joint request. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a).\n        In April 2011, the district court granted summary judgment to Shell on the\nground that two distinct False Claims Act provisions prohibited the suit: Section\n3730(b)(1), describing who may bring suit, and the public disclosure bar\ncontained in Section 3730(e)(4)(A), (B). Relators timely appeal. As amicus\ncuriae, the United States urges us to construe the False Claims Act as barring\nsuits by government employees who discover wrongdoing in the scope of their\nofficial duties.\n                                    DISCUSSION\nI.      Constitutional Standing\n        We first address the government\u2019s claim that there is no Article III\njurisdiction. Though raised for the first time on appeal, a legitimate question\nabout jurisdiction must be answered no matter when it is first asked. Arena v.\nGraybar Elec. Co., 669 F.3d 214, 223 (5th Cir. 2012).\n        A plaintiff ordinarily must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) that the injury is\nfairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and (3) that a victory in litigation will\nlikely redress the injury. See Adar v. Smith, 639 F.3d 146, 150 (5th Cir.) (en\nbanc), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 400 (2011). It is settled that qui tam relators who\nare not federal employees have constitutional standing. Vt. Agency of Natural\n\n                                           3\n\f   Case: 11-20320        Document: 00511940318          Page: 4     Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-20320\n\nRes. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 773-74 (2000). Standing\nexists because \u201ca qui tam relator is, in effect, suing as a partial assignee of the\nUnited States[\u2019s]\u201d claim for damages. Stevens, 529 U.S. at 773 n.4.\n       Article III grants judicial power over the \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies\u201d that\nwere the traditional concern of the courts in England. Id. at 774. There was a\n\u201clong tradition of qui tam actions in England and the American Colonies.\u201d Id.\nWe have interpreted Stevens to hold \u201cthat the history of qui tam was \u2018well nigh\nconclusive\u2019 with respect to resolving the question of whether qui tam relators\nfiling suit under the [False Claims Act] have Article III standing.\u201d Riley v. St.\nLuke\u2019s Episcopal Hosp., 252 F.3d 749, 752 (5th Cir. 2001) (en banc).\n       The government distinguishes Stevens, which involved relators who were\nnot federal employees, by arguing employee-relators might not be able to retain\ntheir litigation awards.2 It contends that the prospect of not retaining damages\nundercuts Stevens\u2019s rationale. Even assuming a federal employee may not retain\nhis award, a subsequent decision clarifies that there nonetheless would be\nstanding. In that decision, the Supreme Court fully embraced the concept that\nan \u201cassignee can sue based on his assignor\u2019s injuries.\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v.\nAPCC Servs., Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 286 (2008). In rejecting the claim that not\nbenefitting from litigation proceeds creates a redressability problem, the court\nheld that the inquiry focuses \u201con whether the injury that a plaintiff alleges is\nlikely to be redressed through the litigation \u2013 not on what the plaintiff\nultimately intends to do with the money he recovers.\u201d Id. at 287.\n       Thus, claims by federal-employee relators can create a case or controversy.\nWe now must determine whether the False Claims Act allows such claims.\n\n\n\n       2\n         The government states without elaboration that \u201ca violation of the [federal] conflict-of-\ninterest rules [,5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2635.101(b)(3), 2635.703(a),] creates a constructive trust on behalf\nof the United States\u201d depriving the employee of his share of the proceeds. We discuss these\nrules in more detail below.\n\n                                                4\n\f      Case: 11-20320        Document: 00511940318         Page: 5    Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                           No. 11-20320\n\nII.      Who May Bring a False Claims Act Qui Tam Action?\n         The district court granted summary judgment, which is proper if there are\nno genuine disputes of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as\na matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Our review is de novo, with the evidence\nbeing viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movants. United States ex\nrel. Jamison v. McKesson Corp., 649 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir. 2011).\n         The position advocated by Shell and the United States is expressly\ncontrary to the holdings of the Eleventh Circuit and the en banc Tenth Circuit.\nUnited States ex rel. Williams v. NEC Corp., 931 F.2d 1493, 1501-02 (11th Cir.\n1991); United States ex rel. Holmes v. Consumer Ins. Grp., 318 F.3d 1199, 1208-\n12 (10th Cir. 2003). Adopting that position would also create tension with the\nen banc Ninth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit. United States ex rel. Fine v.\nChevron U.S.A., Inc., 72 F.3d 740, 743-44 & n.5 (9th Cir. 1995); United States ex\nrel. Burns v. A.D. Roe Co., 186 F.3d 717, 722 & n.5 (6th Cir. 1999). The First\nCircuit, though, has taken the position that at least some federal employees may\nnot be qui tam claimants. United States ex rel. LeBlanc v. Raytheon Co., 913\nF.2d 17, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1990).3 Though we apply our own judgment to every\ncase, we customarily are \u201cchary to create a circuit split.\u201d Alfaro v. Comm\u2019r, 349\nF.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir. 2003). There is something of a split already, though.\n         A.       Statutory Text\n         The place to start in deciding whether these parties can bring this claim\nis the text of the False Claims Act. Med. Ctr. Pharmacy v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d\n383, 394 (5th Cir. 2008). The key provision states this:\n         (b) Actions by private persons.\u2014(1) A person may bring a civil action\n         for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United\n         States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the\n         Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the\n\n\n         3\n             No one in this appeal has advocated for the First Circuit\u2019s approach.\n\n                                                  5\n\f   Case: 11-20320       Document: 00511940318         Page: 6     Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-20320\n\n       Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their\n       reasons for consenting.\n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1) (2006). When a provision is unambiguous and \u201cthe\nstatutory scheme is coherent and consistent,\u201d there is no need for further inquiry\nas to meaning. Schindler Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk, 131 S. Ct.\n1885, 1893 (2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n       \u201cA person\u201d may bring suit, suggesting that any person may do so. See\nStevens, 529 U.S. at 783 n.12. According to the Dictionary Act in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1,\nas well as ordinary usage, a human being is a person.                   See Mohamad v.\nPalestinian Authority, 132 S. Ct. 1702, 1707 (2012). A normal rule of statutory\ninterpretation is that when Congress uses the same word in different parts of a\nstatute, it intended each to carry the same meaning. Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. ACF\nIndus., Inc., 510 U.S. 332, 341-42 (1994). In determining that municipalities can\nbe False Claims Act defendants, the Supreme Court embraced a \u201cpresumption\nthat the statutory term person extends . . . to persons politic and incorporate, as\nto natural persons whatsoever.\u201d            Cook Cnty., Ill. v. United States ex rel.\nChandler, 538 U.S. 119, 125 (2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted).4\n       We also look at the context of the whole statute to make certain contrary\nindications are not found. Bosamia v. C.I.R., 661 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir. 2011).\nSection 3730 contains four other major parts. Subsection (a) grants the Attorney\nGeneral power to enforce the False Claims Act directly, (c) lays out the rights of\nqui tam plaintiffs, and (d) describes their share of any recovery. Subsection (e),\nentitled \u201cCertain actions barred,\u201d enumerates four statutory limits on\njurisdiction. Among these are a bar by subject, by identity of defendant, and a\n\n       4\n         The Court\u2019s earlier holding that \u201cperson\u201d excluded States is not to the contrary. See\ngenerally Stevens, 529 U.S. at 780 (2000). That interpretation was counseled by (i) the False\nClaims Act\u2019s structure (below, we conclude the opposite as to government employee relators),\nid. at 783-84, and (ii) by the \u201clongstanding interpretive presumption that \u2018person\u2019 does not\ninclude the sovereign,\u201d id. at 780. Also, in Stevens it was accepted as clear that the False\nClaims Act was directed \u201cat natural persons.\u201d Id. at 782.\n\n                                              6\n\f   Case: 11-20320    Document: 00511940318      Page: 7   Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-20320\n\nspecial military exclusion. Suits duplicative of civil suits or administrative\nactions with the government as a party are barred. \u00a7 3730(e)(3). No suits may\nbe lodged against members of Congress, the judiciary, or senior executive branch\nofficials. \u00a7 3730(e)(2)(A). Former or current armed services personnel cannot\nsue another member of the armed forces for matters \u201carising out of such person\u2019s\nservice in the armed forces.\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(1). The (e)(4) exception for public\ndisclosures is analyzed in detail later.\n      The existence of these limiting provisions is instructive. When Congress\nprovides express \u201cexceptions in a statute, it does not follow that courts have\nauthority to create others.\u201d United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 58 (2000).\nInstead, we typically infer that Congress wished to limit the statute only as\nstated. Id. Shell and the government argue they are not seeking a judicially-\nimposed limit. Instead, they claim subsection (b)(1)\u2019s heading of \u201cActions by\nprivate persons\u201d narrows the universe of relators just to non-governmental\npersons. \u201cPrivate\u201d can mean \u201cbelonging to an individual, as opposed to the\npublic or the government.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1315 (9th ed. 2009).\n      The argument drawn from the title is that Congress used \u201cprivate persons\u201d\nto exclude government employees. Equally plausible is that this title simply\ndistinguishes subsection (b)\u2019s provisions pertaining to qui tam suits from the\nprovisions of subsection (a) entitled \u201cResponsibilities of the Attorney General.\u201d\nSee Erickson ex rel. United States v. Am. Inst. of Biological Scis., 716 F. Supp.\n908, 915 n.12 (E.D. Va. 1989). In that understanding, the title \u201cprivate persons\u201d\nmeans those filers of suits who are not the Attorney General. Regardless of what\nthe language in this title means, a title is a form of abbreviation that frequently\n\u201cfails to refer to all matters which the framers of that section wrote into the\ntext.\u201d United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 924 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks\nand citation omitted), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 135 (2011).\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f   Case: 11-20320      Document: 00511940318         Page: 8     Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-20320\n\n       The relators present another reason why the \u201cprivate persons\u201d title to\nsubsection (b) is not a limitation on who can be a relator. They argue that\nsubsection (e)(1), which prohibits members of the armed services from being\nrelators in suits against other members on claims \u201carising out of\u201d military\nservice, would be unnecessary if the title of \u201cprivate persons\u201d already barred all\nsuits by federal employees. The argument draws on the \u201ccardinal principle of\nstatutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed\nthat, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous,\nvoid, or insignificant.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). We are reluctant to put much analytical weight\non this section dealing with the military. The treatment of members of the\narmed services under the False Claims Act has been the subject of recurring re-\nevaluations and recalibrations almost since the Act was adopted in 1863. Dan\nL. Hargrove, Soldiers of Qui Tam Fortune: Do Military Service Members Have\nStanding to File Qui Tam Actions Under the False Claims Act, 34 Pub. Cont. L.J.\n45, 83-85 (2004). Were we to agree with the relators as to the significance of\nsubsection (e)(1), it would only confirm a conclusion we have reached for other\nreasons. We need not explore this particular argument further.\n       In earlier suits, the government has argued that no federal employee may\nbe a relator.5 In this appeal, the government and Shell ask us to interpret\n\u201cprivate\u201d as excluding only some sub-class of federal employees. Perhaps it\nwould be those who learn of the fraud during their official duties or those\nemployed to audit or otherwise investigate fraud.6 Fine-tuning such exceptions\n\n\n       5\n        It unsuccessfully argued to the Eleventh Circuit that the False Claims Act \u201ccontained\na general exclusion against all government employees as qui tam plaintiffs.\u201d Williams, 931\nF.2d at 1502.\n       6\n         Shell claims that those \u201cwho are paid to investigate and report fraud and who then\nseek to file qui tam suits based on information they developed for the government\u201d may not\nbe False Claims Act relators. The United States\u2019s proposed construction sweeps a bit more\n\n                                             8\n\f   Case: 11-20320      Document: 00511940318        Page: 9    Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                     No. 11-20320\n\nwould be based on little more than our perception of reasonable policy limits.\nThe exceptions would not arise from the text of the Act. Not only would these\nnew definitions take us beyond the \u201cordinary or natural meaning\u201d appropriate\nfor undefined terms, they would commit us to a process of exposition in future\ncases. F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476 (1994); e.g., United States ex rel.\nHolmes v. Consumer Ins. Grp., 318 F.3d 1199, 1217 n.2 (10th Cir. 2003) (en banc)\n(Tacha, J., dissenting). Because \u201cthe federal lawmaking power is vested in the\nlegislative, not the judicial, branch of government,\u201d we will not undertake\ncreating exceptions to this statutory language. Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. Transp.\nWorkers Union of Am., AFL-CIO, 451 U.S. 77, 95 (1981).\n      Shell directs us to one other phrase in the False Claims Act. It claims\nthere is an exception embedded in the statutory statement that because the suit\nis brought \u201cfor the person and for the United States,\u201d government employees are\nnot contemplated. \u00a7 3730(b)(1) (emphasis added). The argument is that because\nthe government can only act through individuals, a government employee cannot\nact \u201cfor the United States\u201d; that person is the United States.\n      We are unconvinced. A person can have two legal identities, one official\nand one individual. E.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 27 (1991) (explaining that\na \u201cgovernment official in the role of a personal-capacity defendant . . . fits\ncomfortably within the statutory term \u2018person\u2019\u201d). Second, we take our cue from\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s early encounter with the False Claims Act. United States\nex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537 (1943). The Court determined that the\nstatute had \u201cno words of exception or qualification\u201d at a time when the virtually\nidentical clause \u201cas well as for himself as for the United States\u201d was part of the\nFalse Claims Act. An Act to Prevent and Punish Frauds upon the Government\nof the United States, ch. 67, 12 Stat. 696 (1863). In granting the statute\u2019s\n\n\nbroadly. It would prohibit suits by any \u201cgovernment employee who obtains information about\nfraud in the course of his official duties.\u201d\n\n                                            9\n\f  Case: 11-20320       Document: 00511940318          Page: 10     Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-20320\n\nlanguage full effect, the Court embraced the notion that \u201ceven a district\nattorney, who would presumably gain all knowledge of a fraud from his official\nposition, might sue as the informer.\u201d Hess, 317 U.S. at 546.\n       The text of the False Claims Act supports the relators\u2019 standing.\n       B.     Conflict of Interest Principles\n       In the alternative, the government and Shell rely on a statute and\nregulations that concern ethical obligations of federal employees. One is the\ncriminal conflict-of-interest statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. The other is a set of\nfederal ethics regulations. See 5 C.F.R. pt. 2635 (\u201cStandards of Ethical Conduct\nfor Employees of the Executive Branch\u201d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301. Allowing federal\nemployees to be relators is said to conflict with both these provisions. We accept,\nwithout exploring in detail, that there are potential if not clear difficulties under\nthose provisions for federal employees to be relators.7\n       The argument that flows from the possibility that obligations extraneous\nto the False Claims Act affect these relators is that we must harmonize different\nlaws if possible, which is a corollary of the rule that an individual statute should\nbe construed as a whole. 2B Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory\nConstruction \u00a7 51.1, at 200 (7th ed. 2008). Nonetheless, \u201cother statutes may not\nbe resorted to if the statute is clear and unambigious.\u201d Id. at 197. That latter\n\n\n\n       7\n          The crime statute on its face pertains only to interested-official acts. It bars\nemployees from participating \u201cthrough decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the\nrendering of advice, investigation\u201d when the \u201cjudicial or other proceeding, application, [or]\nrequest for a ruling\u201d is one in which they have a financial interest. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. Section\n2635.101(b)(3) prohibits the \u201cimproper use\u201d of nonpublic information to further private\ninterest, and various provisos bar employees from \u201cparticipating personally and substantially\nin an official capacity\u201d in matters in which they have a financial interest. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\n2635.402(a). The regulation on misuse of government property does not facially encompass\nfacts learned at work, except in the case of intellectual property that has been purchased. See\n\u00a7 2635.704(b)(1) (\u201cGovernment property includes any form of real or personal property in\nwhich the Government has an ownership, leasehold, or other property interest as well as any\nright or other intangible interest that is purchased with Government funds . . . .\u201d).\n\n                                              10\n\f  Case: 11-20320       Document: 00511940318         Page: 11     Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-20320\n\nmaxim applies to the unambiguous statement that begins subsection (b): \u201cA\nperson\u201d may bring suit.\n       Even were we inclined to venture outside the False Claims Act in search\nof meaning, however, it would be inappropriate to draw from the conflict-of-\ninterest rules. The justification for the in pari materia canon is that Congress\nshould be assumed to have legislated with reference to the other provision.\nSinger, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.1, at 203.                       Thus, a\nconventional limit on the canon is that courts should harmonize only those\n\u201cstatutes addressing the same subject matter.\u201d Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt, 546\nU.S. 303, 316 (2006).8 In Schmidt, the Court concluded that the provisions on\nsubject matter jurisdiction and venue were not sufficiently similar to be\nharmonized. Id. The False Claims Act rules and the ethics guidelines for\nfederal employees are not the same subject.\n       The government and Shell also argue that failing to give effect to the\nconflict-of-interest and ethics requirements would require us to acknowledge\nthat those provisions were impliedly repealed, and such repeals are disfavored.\nSee Jackson v. Stinnett, 102 F.3d 132, 135-36 (5th Cir. 1996). We do not accept\nthe premise for this argument, namely, that the relevant provisions are\nsomehow inoperative. How they operate on these relators is an issue for another\ntime and place. At no stage in this litigation has the government taken the\nposition that Little and Arnold committed a crime, or violated a specific\nregulation. We have no evidence that their federal agency disciplined them.\nNothing in the record indicates that the lawsuit was filed while at work, or\n\n\n\n       8\n         It has been noted that even when legislation expressly references other law, an\ninterpreting court should not assume that because \u201cthe reference makes discovery of the prior\nact possible,\u201d such a discovery necessarily has occurred. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory\nConstruction \u00a7 51.1, at 203. In the False Claims Act, there is not even that type of cross-\nreference.\n\n                                             11\n\f  Case: 11-20320      Document: 00511940318         Page: 12     Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-20320\n\notherwise in dereliction of their duties. Were such claims made at some point,\nthey would be processed in a forum separate from this suit.\n       Further, using the conflict rules to override the False Claims Act\u2019s terms\nwould interfere with the other two coordinate branches of our government. We\nwould thwart a cause of action Congress permitted. See Med. Ctr. Pharmacy, 536\nF.3d at 394. As to the ethics prohibitions, which are susceptible to multiple\nreasonable interpretations, we would tie the hands of the President who is vested\nwith discretion to enforce those regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301.\n       There is evidence the Executive Branch in the past has permitted\nemployee-relator suits. In 1996, the Department of Justice (DOJ) created a\nmanual entitled \u201cRelator\u2019s Share Guidelines\u201d to assist government attorneys in\nmaking recommendations for the award, within the statutory range, in qui tam\nsuits.9 A factor \u201cfor consideration for a possible decrease in the percentage\u201d\nproposed by the DOJ was that \u201c[t]he relator learned of the fraud in the course of\nhis Government employment.\u201d Also at oral argument, the question was put to\nthe government why its authority to intervene could not be a vehicle for\nredressing ethical or administrative concerns. It admitted that its existing\nauthority was up to the task, but that it was unwilling to incur the political costs\nassociated with dismissing potentially meritorious suits. This candid admission\nand the DOJ\u2019s guideline, which counsels reduced but not zero recovery, illustrate\nwhy it is sound for us to follow the statutory text.\n       C.     Other Considerations\n              1.     Legislative History\n       The text under consideration here is the product of a 1986 congressional\noverhaul of the False Claims Act. False Claims Amendments Act, Pub. L. No.\n\n\n       9\n        See United States ex rel. Alderson v. Quorum Health Grp. Inc., 171 F. Supp. 2d 1323,\n1333-34 & n.33 (M.D. Fla. 2001); United States ex rel. Johnson-Pochardt v. Rapid City Reg\u2019l\nHosp., 252 F. Supp. 2d 892, 899 n.2 (D.S.D. 2003).\n\n                                             12\n\f  Case: 11-20320     Document: 00511940318      Page: 13    Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-20320\n\n99-562, 100 Stat. 3153 (1986). Each party argues that if we study Congress\u2019s\n1986 drafting history, a clear purpose supportive of their position will emerge\nthat should guide our statutory interpretation. We have already determined\nthat this part of the Act needs no further elaboration.\n      The divergent messages that can be obtained from legislative history\nrender the history prone to selective use. See Nalle v. C.I.R., 997 F.2d 1134, 1137\n(5th Cir. 1993). Because the 1986 False Claims Act bill was so repeatedly revised\nen route to final passage, this is particularly true as to it. See Graham Cnty. Soil\n& Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 1407\nn.15 (2010). That winding path through Congress \u201cprovides ample opportunity\nto search the legislative history and find some support somewhere for almost any\nconstruction\u201d of its terms. Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). Shell and\nthe relators have done just that. Relators point to a U.S. Merit Systems Board\nsurvey cited in the Senate Report recounting that almost 70 percent of federal\nemployees with knowledge of illegality failed to take appropriate internal action.\nBy contrast, Shell focuses on the passage in the same report that says the\npurpose of the amendments was to \u201callow and encourage assistance from the\nprivate citizenry.\u201d S. Rep. No. 99-345 at 8 (1986). Given the general and specific\npitfalls associated with legislative history of this Act, we do not search for further\nenlightenment in it.\n             2.    Absurdity\n      If the result we reach is absurd, we might need to proceed beyond the plain\nmeaning. United States v. Rabanal, 508 F.3d 741, 743-44 (5th Cir. 2007). We\nbriefly address why our interpretation is not an absurdity.\n      The government and Shell claim that today\u2019s holding will work \u201can\nunseemly and counter-productive result.\u201d         We are aware of the dilemmas\nidentified. Chief among them is how to ensure employee fidelity to agency\nenforcement priorities in the face of personal monetary incentives. Our holding,\n\n                                         13\n\f  Case: 11-20320       Document: 00511940318         Page: 14     Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-20320\n\nthough, does not prevent the government from promulgating new personnel\nguidelines (or enforcing old ones) to manage these concerns. Also, as discussed\nearlier, the government can intervene and dismiss actions.\n       Absurdity requires more than questionable policy. Miss. Poultry Ass\u2019n, Inc.\nv. Madigan, 992 F.2d 1359, 1365 (5th Cir. 1993). There are plausible reasons for\nCongress to have authorized governmental relator suits, which forecloses\nrecourse to the absurdity canon. Id.; see also Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534\nU.S. 438, 461-62 (2002).          The government has monetary and personnel\nconstraints that do not enable it to pursue every lead or prosecute every\nwrongdoer. By nature, bureaucracies can be slow to act, and on occasion can fall\nvictim to corruption or restrictive partisan agendas. There is potential for\ngovernmental relators to prompt more agency responsiveness even when suits\nare not filed. Additionally, the prospect of monetary awards might provide public\nservants with additional incentives to ferret out fraud.10\n       Our task is still unfinished. Having decided that Little and Arnold\u2019s\nemployment as government auditors does not deprive them of standing under the\nFalse Claims Act, we now consider whether their particular factual allegations\nbring them within the terms of the public disclosure bar. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4).\n\n\nIII.   Public Disclosure Bar\n        Section 3730(e)(4) expresses a balance of interests Congress struck in\n1986. Graham Cnty., 130 S. Ct. at 1407. It implicates the subject matter\njurisdiction of the court in a unique way. Rockwell Intern. Corp. v. United States,\n\n\n       10\n         These types of arguments can be found in the literature on the Act. See, e.g., Barry\nM. Landy, Note, Deterring Fraud to Increase Public Confidence: Why Congress Should Allow\nGovernment Employees to File Qui Tam Lawsuits, 94 Minn. L. Rev. 1239, 1256-64 (2010);\nDavid Wallace, Government Employees as Qui Tam Relators, 1996-Aug. Army Law. 14, 21-22\n(1996); Joan R. Bullock, The Pebble in the Shoe: Making the Case for the Government\nEmployee, 60 Tenn. L. Rev. 365 (1993).\n\n                                             14\n\f  Case: 11-20320       Document: 00511940318          Page: 15      Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-20320\n\n549 U.S. 457, 467-68 (2007). By virtue of the general grant of federal question\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and the False Claims Act, we have power over\nthese suits until and unless it becomes evident that our jurisdiction to adjudicate\nthe substantive allegations has been withdrawn. See id. at 468. This typically\noccurs at the summary judgment stage. McKesson, 649 F.3d at 326.11\n       On summary judgment, the opposing party must first identify \u201cpublic\ndocuments that could plausibly contain allegations or transactions upon which\nthe relator\u2019s action is based.\u201d McKesson, 649 F.3d at 327. Then, the relator must\nput forth \u201cevidence sufficient to show that there is a genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether his action was based on those public disclosures.\u201d Id.\n       A.     Public Disclosure\n       In its motion for summary judgment, Shell designated five categories of\nevidence: (1) civil proceedings, (2) news media accounts, (3) two published\narticles, (4) certain communications between the company and MMS, and (5) a\n2002-2003 audit. This is the full universe of materials appropriately under\nconsideration. See id. On appeal, the parties\u2019 chief focus has been category one.\nSpecifically it consists of three prior False Claims Act cases, as well as several\nadministrative decisions. Relators contend that the information in categories\nfour and five was never disseminated into the public domain. If true, then they\nwould not be proper subjects for analysis. See United States ex rel. Reagan v. E.\nTex. Med. Ctr., 384 F.3d 168, 175-76 (5th Cir. 2004); Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1836 (1993) (public means \u201cexposed to general view\u201d)\n(hereinafter Webster\u2019s).\n       The public disclosure bar is explained in these provisions:\n\n\n\n       11\n          These observations and the following analysis pertain to Section 3730(e)(4) before its\namendment in 2010 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148, 124\nStat. 199, 901, \u00a7 10104(j)(2) (Mar. 23, 2010). This suit has been pending since 2006 and the\ntext is not retroactively applicable. See McKesson, 649 F.3d at 326 n.6.\n\n                                              15\n\f  Case: 11-20320    Document: 00511940318     Page: 16   Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-20320\n\n      (4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this\n      section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or\n      transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a\n      congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office\n      report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media,\n      unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person\n      bringing the action is an original source of the information.\n\n      (B) For purposes of this paragraph, \u201coriginal source\u201d means an\n      individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the\n      information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily\n      provided the information to the Government before filing an action\n      under this section which is based on the information.\n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4) (2006).\n      Below we explain why Little and Arnold cannot be original sources. The\nremaining questions thus are \u201c1) whether there has been a \u2018public disclosure\u2019 of\nallegations or transactions, [and] 2) whether the qui tam action is \u2018based upon\u2019\nsuch publicly disclosed allegations.\u201d McKesson, 649 F.3d at 327 (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). We have held that \u201cthe publicly disclosed allegations or\ntransactions need only be as broad and as detailed as those in the relator\u2019s\ncomplaint.\u201d Id. In McKesson, we found sources such as a restatement of the\napplicable law and \u201cgeneral statements that [a type of] fraud is \u2018proliferating\u2019\u201d\ninadequate to trigger the disclosure bar on their own. Id. at 329-330. The bar\napplied only because the complaint at issue \u201cdescribed various fraudulent\nschemes only generally\u201d and was devoid of \u201cparticular allegations against any\ndefendant.\u201d Id. at 328, 330-31.\n      By contrast, the complaint here identifies Shell by name, gives a specific\ntime period, and offers details about the scheme. When specifics are alleged, it\nis crucial to consider whether the disclosures correspond in scope and breadth.\nA guiding query is whether \u201cone could have produced the substance of the\ncomplaint merely by synthesizing the public disclosures\u2019 description\u201d of a scheme.\nId. at 331. Correlation in detail is not the only question. It can be that\n\n                                       16\n\f  Case: 11-20320    Document: 00511940318      Page: 17    Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-20320\n\ndisclosures \u201cprovide[] specific details about the fraudulent scheme and the types\nof actors involved in it\u201d such that the defendant\u2019s misconduct would have been\nreadily identifiable. Id. at 329-30 (discussing In re Natural Gas Royalties, 562\nF.3d 1032, 1039 (10th Cir. 2009), while cautioning to use its reasoning sparingly).\n      An irreducible minimum is that the disclosures furnish evidence of the\nfraudulent scheme alleged. The claimed scheme here is a willful violation of\nMMS rules and guidelines in order to deduct the costs of gathering (or upstream\ncosts) from royalty-in-kind payments. Cf. United States ex rel. Maxwell v. Kerr-\nMcGee Oil & Gas Corp., 540 F.3d 1180, 1187 (10th Cir. 2008).\n      In granting summary judgment, the district court relied on similarities\nbetween what was publicly disclosed and what was stated in the complaint:\n            For an action to be based on public disclosure, the disclosure\n      and the factual basis of the suit need not be identical. Rather, the\n      public disclosure must have been sufficient for the government to\n      find related frauds, even though the circumstances of the\n      transactions may differ.\n\n            Little and Arnold say that Shell fraudulently deducted oil\n      transportation costs on the Mineral Management Service\u2019s Form\n      2014s for specific oil leases from October 2001 through December\n      2005. The record shows that the earlier, notorious claims are\n      parallel to the auditors\u2019 suit. Little and Arnold complain by merely\n      applying public information \u2013 in both senses \u2013 to specific leases that\n      they investigated for the government.\n\n            Little and Arnold admit as much in their response to Shell:\n      \u201cThe cases listed by Shell identify wrongful acts committed by\n      several petroleum companies, in different time periods, on different\n      leases, and for different products.\u201d Changing 2005 to 2006, carbon\n      dioxide to gas, on-shore to off-shore, tract A to tract B, and Shell for\n      Exxon do[es] not change the mechanism of the fraud or the\n      obviousness that the question would potentially apply to every\n      operator of a federal lease. Lower payment of royalties are identical\n      from deducting transportation costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\f  Case: 11-20320    Document: 00511940318      Page: 18   Date Filed: 07/31/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-20320\n\n      The district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion about public disclosure could be\ncorrect, but the court applied an overly broad definition of such disclosure. The\ndistrict court\u2019s listing of what had to be changed from the publicly disclosed\ninformation to what is in the complaint cuts against the conclusion that the\ncomplaint is based on the disclosures. It is not apparent from the district court\u2019s\nanalysis that Little and Arnold \u201ccould have produced the substance of the\ncomplaint merely by synthesizing the public disclosures\u2019 description of\u201d the\nscheme. McKesson, 649 F.3d at 331.\n      We therefore remand for that court to reexamine the summary judgment\nevidence. The district court should determine whether the public disclosures\nidentified in the motion for summary judgment reveal either (i) that Shell was\ndeducting gathering expenses prohibited by program regulations, or (ii) that this\ntype of fraud was so pervasive in the industry that the company\u2019s scheme, as\nalleged, would have been easily identified. McKesson, 649 F.3d at 329.\n      B.    Original Source\n      Finally, only if a public disclosure has occurred in this case will it become\nrelevant whether the relator was an original source for the information. To\nqualify, a relator must have \u201cdirect and independent knowledge\u201d of the\nallegations underlying his complaint, and also must have \u201cvoluntarily provided\nthe information to the Government.\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(4); see Rockwell, 549 U.S. at 471-\n73. We agree with the district court, and the other courts to have reached the\nissue, that the fact that a relator \u201cwas employed specifically to disclose fraud is\nsufficient to render his disclosures nonvoluntary.\u201d United States ex rel.

            "opinion_text": "\nLESLIE H. SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judge:\nThis case presents an issue of first impression for our court. Is a federal employee, even one whose job it is to investigate fraud, a \u201cperson\u201d under the False Claims Act such that he may maintain a qui tam action? We disagree with the district court and conclude that there is no basis to except such an employee from personhood. A second question is whether the Act\u2019s \u201cpublic disclosure bar\u201d is an impediment to this suit. The district court determined that this bar applied but used an overly broad conception of the bar. We REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nIn early 2006, relators Randall Little and Joel Arnold filed two qui tam suits against Shell in the Western District of Oklahoma. They alleged that Shell had defrauded the U.S. Department of the Interior of at least $19 million. Specifically, they charged that from October 2001 through 2005, Shell had deprived the United States of royalties by taking unauthorized deductions for expenses to gather and store oil on twelve of its offshore drilling platforms.\nAt the time their suits were filed, Little was a Senior Auditor and Arnold a Supervisory Auditor for the Minerals Management Service (MMS), an agency within the Department of the Interior that administered Shell\u2019s leases.1 Part of MMS\u2019s mission was to uncover theft or fraud in the royalty programs. Little reported the information he uncovered to Arnold, his immediate supervisor, and the two furnished it to their mutual superior, Lonnie Kim-ball. It is undisputed that the Shell allegations came to light during the course of their official duties and that reporting their findings to Kimball was a job requirement. It is also undisputed that this information was conveyed before the filings of the qui tam actions. To their knowledge, neither MMS nor any other federal agency has ever acted on this information.\nSpecial procedures apply to qui tam suits under the False Claims Act. They are suits brought \u201cfor the person and for the United States Government.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1). Before a defendant is served, the relator must provide the complaint and \u201csubstantially all material evidence and information\u201d he has to the United States. \u00a7 3730(b)(2). The case remains under seal for 60 days. The government may intervene in the litigation and then prosecute the action itself, or move to have it dismissed. \u00a7 3730(c)(2)(A). The court may grant dismissal \u201cnotwithstanding the objections\u201d of relators. Id. Should the government intervene and continue the suit, the relators receive between 10 and 25 percent of any judgment, whereas their share rises to between 25 and 30 percent if the United States declines participation. \u00a7 3730(d)(1), (2).\nThese procedures were followed. After the government notified the court it did not wish to intervene, the court ordered the case to be unsealed and the defendants to be served. The cases were transferred *285from Oklahoma to the Southern District of Texas on March 2, 2007, and consolidated there by the parties\u2019 joint request. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a); Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(a).\nIn April 2011, the district court granted summary judgment to Shell on the ground that two distinct False Claims Act provisions prohibited the suit: Section 3730(b)(1), describing who may bring suit, and the public disclosure bar contained in Section 3730(e)(4)(A), (B). Relators timely appeal. As amicus curiae, the United States urges us to construe the False Claims Act as barring suits by government employees who discover wrongdoing in the scope of their official duties.\nDISCUSSION\n\n1. Constitutional Standing\n\nWe first address the government\u2019s claim that there is no Article III jurisdiction. Though raised for the first time on appeal, a legitimate question about jurisdiction must be answered no matter when it is first asked. Arena v. Graybar Elec. Co., 669 F.3d 214, 223 (5th Cir.2012).\nA plaintiff ordinarily must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and (3) that a victory in litigation will likely redress the injury. See Adar v. Smith, 639 F.3d 146, 150 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 400, 181 L.Ed.2d 257 (2011). It is settled that qui tarn relators who are not federal employees have constitutional standing. Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 773-74, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000). Standing exists because \u201ca qui tarn relator is, in effect, suing as a partial assignee of the United States[\u2019s]\u201d claim for damages. Stevens, 529 U.S. at 773 n. 4, 120 S.Ct. 1858.\nArticle III grants judicial power over the \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies\u201d that were the traditional concern of the courts in England. Id. at 774, 120 S.Ct. 1858. There was a \u201clong tradition of qui tarn actions in England and the American Colonies.\u201d Id. We have interpreted Stevens to hold \u201cthat the history of qui tarn was \u2018well nigh conclusive\u2019 with respect to resolving the question of whether qui tarn relators filing suit under the [False Claims Act] have Article III standing.\u201d Riley v. St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Hosp., 252 F.3d 749, 752 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc).\nThe government distinguishes Stevens, which involved relators who were not federal employees, by arguing employee-relators might not be able to retain their litigation awards.2 It contends that the prospect of not retaining damages undercuts Stevens\u2019s rationale. Even assuming a federal employee may not retain his award, a subsequent decision clarifies that there nonetheless would be standing. In that decision, the Supreme Court fully embraced the concept that an \u201cassignee can sue based on his assignor\u2019s injuries.\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 286, 128 S.Ct. 2531, 171 L.Ed.2d 424 (2008). In rejecting the claim that not benefitting from litigation proceeds creates a redressability problem, the court held that the inquiry focuses \u201con whether the injury that a plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litigation \u2014 not on what the plaintiff ultimately intends to do with the money he recovers.\u201d Id. at 287, 128 S.Ct. 2531.\n*286Thus, claims by federal-employee relators can create a case or controversy. We now must determine whether the False Claims Act allows such claims.\nII. Who May Bring a False Claims Act Qui Tam Action?\nThe district court granted summary judgment, which is proper if there are no genuine disputes of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Our review is de novo, with the evidence being viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movants. United States ex rel. Jamison v. McKesson Corp., 649 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.2011).\nThe position advocated by Shell and the United States is expressly contrary to the holdings of the Eleventh Circuit and the en banc Tenth Circuit. United States ex rel. Williams v. NEC Corp., 931 F.2d 1493, 1501-02 (11th Cir.1991); United States ex rel. Holmes v. Consumer Ins. Grp., 318 F.3d 1199, 1208-12 (10th Cir.2003). Adopting that position would also create tension with the en banc Ninth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit. United States ex rel. Fine v. Chevron U.S.A, Inc., 72 F.3d 740, 743-44 &amp; n. 5 (9th Cir.1995); United States ex rel. Burns v. A.D. Roe Co., 186 F.3d 717, 722 &amp; n. 5 (6th Cir. 1999). The First Circuit, though, has taken the position that at least some federal employees may not be qui tarn claimants. United States ex rel. LeBlanc v. Raytheon Co., 913 F.2d 17, 19-20 (1st Cir.1990).3 Though we apply our own judgment to every case, we customarily are \u201cchary to create a circuit split.\u201d Alfaro v. Comm\u2019r, 349 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2003). There is something of a split already, though.\n\nA. Statutory Text\n\nThe place to start in deciding whether these parties can bring this claim is the text of the False Claims Act. Med. Ctr. Pharmacy v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 383, 394 (5th Cir.2008). The key provision states this:\n(b) Actions by private persons.\u2014(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.\n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1) (2006). When a provision is unambiguous and \u201cthe statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,\u201d there is no need for further inquiry as to meaning. Schindler Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk,\u2014U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1885, 1893, 179 L.Ed.2d 825 (2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\u201cA person\u201d may bring suit, suggesting that any person may do so. See Stevens, 529 U.S. at 783 n. 12, 120 S.Ct. 1858. According to the Dictionary Act in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, as well as ordinary usage, a human being is a person. See Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority,\u2014U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 182 L.Ed.2d 720 (2012). A normal rule of statutory interpretation is that when Congress uses the same word in different parts of a statute, it intended each to carry the same meaning. Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. ACF Indus., Inc., 510 U.S. 332, 341-42, 114 S.Ct. 843, 127 L.Ed.2d 165 (1994). In determining that municipalities can be False Claims Act defendants, the Supreme Court embraced a \u201cpresumption that the statutory term per*287son extends ... to persons politic and incorporate, as to natural persons whatsoever.\u201d Cook Cnty., Ill. v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U.S. 119, 125, 123 S.Ct. 1239, 155 L.Ed.2d 247 (2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted).4\nWe also look at the context of the whole statute to make certain contrary indications are not found. Bosamia v. C.I.R., 661 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2011). Section 3730 contains four other major parts. Subsection (a) grants the Attorney General power to enforce the False Claims Act directly, (c) lays out the rights of qui tam plaintiffs, and (d) describes their share of any recovery. Subsection (e), entitled \u201cCertain actions barred,\u201d enumerates four statutory limits on jurisdiction. Among these are a bar by subject, by identity of defendant, and a special military exclusion. Suits duplicative of civil suits or administrative actions with the government as a party are barred. \u00a7 3730(e)(3). No suits may be lodged against members of Congress, the judiciary, or senior executive branch officials. \u00a7 3730(e)(2)(A). Former or current armed services personnel cannot sue another member of the armed forces for matters \u201carising out of such person\u2019s service in the armed forces.\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(1). The (e)(4) exception for public disclosures is analyzed in detail later.\nThe existence of these limiting provisions is instructive. When Congress provides express \u201cexceptions in a statute, it does not follow that courts have authority to create others.\u201d United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 58, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000). Instead, we typically infer that Congress wished to limit the statute only as stated. Id. . Shell and the government argue they are not seeking a judicially-imposed limit. Instead, they claim subsection (b)(l)\u2019s heading of \u201cActions by private persons\u201d narrows the universe of relators just to non-governmental persons. \u201cPrivate\u201d can mean \u201cbelonging to an individual, as opposed to the public or the government.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1315 (9th ed. 2009).\nThe argument drawn from the title is that Congress used \u201cprivate persons\u201d to exclude government employees. Equally plausible is that this title simply distinguishes subsection (b)\u2019s provisions pertaining to qui tam suits from the provisions of subsection (a) entitled \u201cResponsibilities of the Attorney General.\u201d See Erickson ex rel. United States v. Am. Inst. of Biological Scis., 716 F.Supp. 908, 915 n. 12 (E.D.Va.1989). In that understanding, the title \u201cprivate persons\u201d means those filers of suits who are not the Attorney General. Regardless of what the language in this title means, a title is a form of abbreviation that frequently \u201cfails to refer to all matters which the framers of that section wrote into the text.\u201d United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 924 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks and citation omitted), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 135, 181 L.Ed.2d 55 (2011).\nThe relators present another reason why the \u201cprivate persons\u201d title to subsection (b) is not a limitation on who can be a relator. They argue that subsection (e)(1), which prohibits members of the armed services from being relators in suits against other members on claims \u201carising *288out of\u2019 military service, would be unnecessary if the title of \u201cprivate persons\u201d already barred all suits by federal employees. The argument draws on the \u201ccardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001) (quotation marks and citations omitted). We are reluctant to put much analytical weight on this section dealing with the military. The treatment of members of the armed services under the False Claims Act has been the subject of recurring re-evaluations and re-calibrations almost since the Act was adopted in 1863. Dan L. Hargrove, Soldiers of Qui Tam Fortune: Do Military Service Members Have Standing to File Qui Tam Actions Under the False Claims Act, 34 Pub. Cont. L.J. 45, 83-85 (2004). Were we to agree with the relators as to the significance of subsection (e)(1), it would only confirm a conclusion we have reached for other reasons. We need not explore this particular argument further.\nIn earlier suits, the government has argued that no federal employee may be a relator.5 In this appeal, the government and Shell ask us to interpret \u201cprivate\u201d as excluding only some sub-class of federal employees. Perhaps it would be those who learn of the fraud during their official duties or those employed to audit or otherwise investigate fraud.6 Fine-tuning such exceptions would be based on little more than our perception of reasonable policy limits. The exceptions would not arise from the text of the Act. Not only would these new definitions take us beyond the \u201cordinary or natural m\u00e9aning\u201d appropriate for undefined terms, they would commit us to a process of exposition in future cases. F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994); e.g., United States ex rel. Holmes v. Consumer Ins. Grp., 318 F.3d 1199, 1217 n. 2 (10th Cir.2003) (en banc) (Tacha, J., dissenting). Because \u201cthe federal lawmaking power is vested in the legislative, not the judicial, branch of government,\u201d we will not undertake creating exceptions to this statutory language. Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. Transp. Workers Union of Am., AFL-CIO, 451 U.S. 77, 95, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981).\nShell directs us to one other phrase in the False Claims Act. It claims there is an exception embedded in the statutory statement that because the suit is brought \u201cfor the person and for the United States,\u201d government employees are not contemplated. \u00a7 3730(b)(1) (emphasis added). The argument is that because the government can only act through individuals, a government employee cannot act \u201cfor the United States\u201d; that person is the United States.\nWe are unconvinced. A person can have two legal identities, one official and one individual. E.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 27, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (explaining that a \u201cgovernment official in the role of a personal-capacity defendant ... fits comfortably within the statutory term \u2018person\u2019 \u201d). Second, we *289take our cue from the Supreme Court\u2019s early encounter with the False Claims Act. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943). The Court determined that the statute had \u201cno words of exception or qualification\u201d at a time when the virtually identical clause \u201cas well as for himself as for the United States\u201d was part of the False Claims Act. An Act to Prevent and Punish Frauds upon the Government of the United States, ch. 67, 12 Stat. 696 (1863). In granting the statute\u2019s language full effect, the Court embraced the notion that \u201ceven a district attorney, who would presumably gain all knowledge of a fraud from his official position, might sue as the informer.\u201d Hess, 317 U.S. at 546, 63 S.Ct. 379.\nThe text of the False Claims Act supports the relators\u2019 standing.\n\nB. Conflict of Interest Principles\n\nIn the alternative, the government and Shell rely on a statute and regulations that concern ethical obligations of federal employees. One is the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. The other is a set of federal ethics regulations. See 5 C.F.R. pt. 2635 (\u201cStandards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch\u201d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301. Allowing federal employees to be relators is said to conflict with both these provisions. We accept, without exploring in detail, that there are potential if not clear difficulties under those provisions for federal employees to be relators.7 .\nThe argument that flows from the possibility that obligations extraneous to the False Claims Act affect these relators is that we must harmonize different laws if possible, which is a corollary of the rule that an individual statute should be construed as a whole. 2B Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.1, at 200 (7th ed. 2008). Nonetheless, \u201cother statutes may not be resorted to if the statute is clear and unambigious.\u201d Id. at 197. That latter maxim applies to the unambiguous statement that begins subsection (b): \u201cA person\u201d may bring suit.\nEven were we inclined to venture outside the False Claims Act in search of meaning, however, it would be inappropriate to draw from the conflict-of-interest rules. The justification for the in pari materia canon is that Congress should be assumed to have legislated with reference to the other provision. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.1, at 203. Thus, a conventional limit on the canon is that courts should harmonize only those \u201cstatutes addressing the same subject matter.\u201d Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt, 546 U.S. 303, 316, 126 S.Ct. 941, 163 L.Ed.2d 797 (2006).8 In Schmidt, the Court con-*290eluded that the provisions on subject matter jurisdiction and venue were not sufficiently similar to be harmonized. Id. The False Claims Act rules and the ethics guidelines for federal employees are not the same subject.\nThe government and Shell also argue that failing to give effect to the conflict-of-interest and ethics requirements would require us to acknowledge that those provisions were impliedly repealed, and such repeals are disfavored. See Jackson v. Stinnett, 102 F.3d 132, 135-36 (5th Cir.1996). We do not accept the premise for this argument, namely, that the relevant provisions are somehow inoperative. How they operate on these relators is an issue for another time and place. At no stage in this litigation has the government taken the position that Little and Arnold committed a crime, or violated a specific regulation. We have no evidence that their federal agency disciplined them. Nothing in the record indicates that the lawsuit was filed while at work, or otherwise in dereliction of their duties. Were such claims made at some point, they would be processed in a forum separate from this suit.\nFurther, using the conflict rules to override the False Claims Act\u2019s terms would interfere with the other two coordinate branches of our government. We would thwart a cause of action Congress permitted. See Med. Ctr. Pharmacy, 536 F.3d at 394. As to the ethics prohibitions, which are susceptible to multiple reasonable interpretations, we would tie the hands of the President who is vested with discretion to enforce those regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301.\nThere is evidence the Executive Branch in the past has permitted employee-relator suits. In 1996, the Department of Justice (DOJ) created a manual entitled \u201cRelator\u2019s Share Guidelines\u201d to assist government attorneys in making recommendations for the award, within the statutory range, in qui tarn suits.9 A factor \u201cfor consideration for a possible decrease in the percentage\u201d proposed by the DOJ was that \u201c[t]he relator learned of the fraud in the course of his Government employment.\u201d Also at oral argument, the question was put to the government why its authority to intervene could not be a vehicle for redressing ethical or administrative concerns. It admitted that its existing authority was up to the task, but that it was unwilling to incur the political costs associated with dismissing potentially meritorious suits. This candid admission and the DOJ\u2019s guideline, which counsels reduced but not zero recovery, illustrate why it is sound for us to follow the statutory text\n\nC. Other Considerations\n\n\n1. Legislative History\n\nThe text under consideration here is the product of a 1986 congressional overhaul of the False Claims Act. False Claims Amendments Act, Pub.L. No. 99-562, 100 Stat. 3153 (1986). Each party argues that if we study Congress\u2019s 1986 drafting history, a clear purpose supportive of their position will emerge that should guide our statutory interpretation. We have already determined that this part of the Act needs no further elaboration.\n*291The divergent messages that can be obtained from legislative history render the history prone to selective use. See Nalle v. C.I.R., 997 F.2d 1134, 1137 (5th Cir.1993). Because the 1986 False Claims Act bill was so repeatedly revised en route to final passage, this is particularly true as to it. See Graham Cnty. Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, \u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1396, 1407 n. 15, 176 L.Ed.2d 225 (2010). That winding path through Congress \u201cprovides ample opportunity to search the legislative history and find some support somewhere for almost any construction\u201d of its terms. Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). Shell and the relators have done just that. Relators point to a U.S. Merit Systems Board survey cited in the Senate Report recounting that almost 70 percent of federal employees with knowledge of illegality failed to take appropriate internal action. By contrast, Shell focuses on the passage in the same report that says the purpose of the amendments was to \u201callow and encourage assistance from the private citizenry.\u201d S.Rep. No. 99-345 at 8 (1986), 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5273. Given the general and specific pitfalls associated with legislative history of this Act, we do not search for further enlightenment in it.\n\n2. 'Absurdity\n\nIf the result we reach is absurd, we might need to proceed beyond the plain meaning. United States v. Rabanal, 508 F.3d 741, 743-44 (5th Cir.2007). We briefly address why our interpretation is not an absurdity.\nThe government and Shell claim that today\u2019s holding will work \u201can unseemly and counter-productive result.\u201d We are aware of the dilemmas identified. Chief among them is how to ensure employee fidelity to agency enforcement priorities in the face of personal monetary incentives. Our holding, though, does not prevent the government from promulgating new personnel guidelines (or enforcing old ones) to manage these concerns. Also, as discussed earlier, the government can intervene and dismiss actions.\nAbsurdity requires more than questionable policy. Miss. Poultry Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Madigan, 992 F.2d 1359, 1365 (5th Cir.1993). There are plausible reasons for Congress to .have authorized governmental relator suits, which forecloses recourse to the absurdity canon. Id.; see also Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 461-62, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002). The government has monetary and personnel constraints that do not enable it to pursue every lead or prosecute every wrongdoer. By nature, bureaucracies can be slow to act, and on occasion can fall victim to corruption or restrictive partisan agendas. There is potential for governmental relators to prompt more agency responsiveness even when suits are not filed. Additionally, the prospect of monetary awards might provide public servants with additional incentives to ferret out fraud.10\nOur task is still unfinished. Having decided that Little and Arnold\u2019s employment as government auditors does not deprive them of standing under the False Claims Act, we now consider whether their particular factual allegations bring them within *292the terms of the public disclosure bar. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4).\n\nIII. Public Disclosure Bar\n\nSection 3730(e)(4) expresses a balance of interests Congress struck in 1986. Graham Cnty., 130 S.Ct. at 1407. It implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the court in a unique, way. Rockwell Intern. Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 467-68, 127 S.Ct. 1397, 167 L.Ed.2d 190 (2007). By virtue of the general grant of federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and the False Claims Act, we have power over these suits until' and unless it becomes evident that our jurisdiction to adjudicate the substantive allegations has been withdrawn. See id. at 468, 127 S.Ct. 1397. This typically occurs at the summary judgment stage. McKesson, 649 F.3d at 326.11\nOn summary judgment, the opposing party must first identify \u201cpublic documents that could plausibly contain allegations or transactions upon which the relator\u2019s action is based.\u201d McKesson, 649 F.3d at 327. Then, the relator must put forth \u201cevidence sufficient to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his action was based on those public disclosures.\u201d Id.\n\nA. Public Disclosure\n\nIn its motion for summary judgment, Shell designated five categories\" of evidence: (1) civil proceedings, (2) news media accounts, (3) two published articles, (4) certain communications between the company and MMS, and (5) a 2002-2003 audit. This is the full universe of materials appropriately under consideration. See id. On appeal, the parties\u2019 chief focus has been category one. Specifically it consists of three prior False Claims Act cases, as well as sev\u00e9ral administrative decisions. Relators contend that the information in categories four and five was never disseminated into the public domain. If true, then they would not be proper subjects for analysis. See United States ex rel. Reagan v. E. Tex. Med. Ctr., 384 F.3d 168, 175-76 (5th Cir.2004); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1836 (1993) (public means \u201cexposed to general view\u201d) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s).\nThe public disclosure bar is explained in these provisions:\n(4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\n(B) For purposes of this paragraph, \u201coriginal source\u201d means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.\n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4) (2006).\nBelow we explain why Little and Arnold cannot be original sources. The remaining questions thus are \u201c1) whether there has been a \u2018public disclosure\u2019 of allegations or transactions, [and] 2) whether *293the qui tam action is \u2018based upon\u2019 such publicly disclosed allegations.\u201d McKesson, 649 F.3d at 327 (quotation marks and citation omitted). We have held that \u201cthe publicly disclosed allegations or transactions need only be as broad and as detailed as those in the relator\u2019s complaint.\u201d Id. In McKesson, we found sources such as a restatement of the applicable law and \u201cgeneral statements that [a type of] fraud is \u2018proliferating\u2019 \u201d inadequate to trigger the disclosure bar on their own. Id. at 329-30. The bar applied only because the complaint at issue \u201cdescribed various fraudulent schemes only generally\u201d and was devoid of \u201cparticular allegations against any defendant.\u201d Id. at 328, 330-31.\nBy contrast, the complaint here identifies Shell by name, gives a specific time period, and offers details about the scheme. When specifics are alleged, it is crucial to consider whether the disclosures correspond in scope and breadth. A guiding query is whether \u201cone could have produced the substance of the complaint merely by synthesizing the public disclosures\u2019 description\u201d of a scheme. Id. at 331. Correlation in detail is not the only question. It can be that disclosures \u201cprovide[ ] specific details about the fraudulent scheme and the types of actors involved in it\u201d such that the defendant\u2019s misconduct would have been readily identifiable. Id. at 329-30 (discussing In re Natural Gas Royalties, 562 F.3d 1032, 1039 (10th Cir.2009), while cautioning to use its reasoning sparingly).\nAn irreducible minimum is that the disclosures furnish evidence of the fraudulent scheme alleged. The claimed scheme here is a willful violation of MMS rules and guidelines in order to deduct the costs of gathering (or upstream costs) from royalty-in-kind payments. Cf. United States ex rel. Maxwell v. Kerr-McGee Oil &amp; Gas Corp., 540 F.3d 1180, 1187 (10th Cir.2008).\nIn granting summary judgment, the district court relied on similarities between what was publicly disclosed and what was stated in the complaint:\nFor an action to be based on public disclosure, the disclosure and the factual basis of the suit need not be identical. Rather, the public disclosure must have been sufficient for the government to find related frauds, even though the circumstances of the transactions may differ.\nLittle and Arnold say that Shell fraudulently deducted oil transportation costs on the Mineral Management Service\u2019s Form 2014s for specific oil leases from October 2001 through December 2005. The record shows that the earlier, notorious claims are parallel to the auditors\u2019 suit. Little and Arnold complain by merely applying public information \u2014 in both senses \u2014 to specific leases that they investigated for the government.\nLittle and Arnold admit as much in their response to Shell: \u201cThe cases listed by Shell identify wrongful acts committed by several petroleum companies, in different time periods, on different leases, and for different products.\u201d Changing 2005 to 2006, carbon dioxide to gas, on-shore to off-shore, tract A to tract B, and Shell for Exxon do[es] not change the mechanism of the fraud or the obviousness that the question would potentially apply to every operator of a federal lease. Lower payment of royalties are identical from deducting transportation costs.\nThe district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion about public disclosure could be correct, but the court applied an overly broad definition of such disclosure. The district court\u2019s listing of what had to be changed from the publicly disclosed information to *294what is in the complaint cuts against the conclusion that the complaint is based on the disclosures. It is not apparent from the district court\u2019s analysis that Little and Arnold \u201ccould have produced the substance of the complaint merely by synthesizing the public disclosures\u2019 description of\u2019 the scheme. McKesson, 649 F.3d at 331.\nWe therefore remand for that court to reexamine the summary judgment evidence. The district court should determine whether the public disclosures identified in the motion for summary judgment reveal either (i) that Shell was deducting gathering expenses prohibited by program regulations, or (ii) that this type of fraud was so pervasive in the industry that the company\u2019s scheme, as alleged, would have been easily identified. McKesson, 649 F.3d at 329.\n\nB. Original Source\n\nFinally, only if a public disclosure has occurred in this case will it become relevant whether the relator was an original source for the information. To qualify, a relator must have \u201cdirect and independent knowledge\u201d of the allegations underlying his complaint, and also must have \u201cvoluntarily provided the information to the Government.\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(4); see Rockwell, 549 U.S. at 471-73, 127 S.Ct. 1397. We agree with the district court, and the other courts to have reached the issue, that the fact that a relator \u201cwas employed specifically to disclose fraud is sufficient to render his disclosures nonvoluntary.\u201d United States ex rel. Fine v. Chevron, U.S.A., 72 F.3d 740, 744 (9th Cir.1995) (en banc); see also Wercinski v. IBM Corp., 982 F.Supp. 449, 461-62 (S.D.Tex.1997); United States ex rel. Foust v. Grp. Hospitalization &amp; Med. Servs., Inc., 26 F.Supp.2d 60, 73 (D.D.C.1998); Webster\u2019s 2564 (\u201cvoluntary implies freedom from any compulsion that could constrain one\u2019s choice\u201d and defining it as \u201cproduced in or by an act of choice\u201d).\nTherefore, if the district court determines on remand that there was a public disclosure, the suit will need to be dismissed because these relators cannot be the original source.\nLastly, we reject the argument that on remand there is a need to have the case assigned to a different district judge.\nWe REVERSE the judgment and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n. Governmental reorganizations have eliminated the MMS.\n\n\n. The government states without elaboration that \u201ca violation of the [federal] conflict-of-interest rules [,5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2635.101(b)(3), 2635.703(a),] creates a constructive trust on behalf of the United States\u201d depriving the employee of his share of the proceeds. We discuss these rules in more detail below.\n\n\n. No one in this appeal has advocated for the First Circuit's approach.\n\n\n. The Court's earlier holding that \"person\u201d excluded States is not to the contrary. See generally Stevens, 529 U.S. at 780, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000). That interpretation was counseled by (i) the False Claims Act\u2019s structure (below, we conclude the opposite as to government employee relators), id. at 783-84, and (ii) by the \"longstanding interpretive presumption that 'person' does not include the sovereign,\u201d id. at 780, 120 S.Ct. 1858. Also, in Stevens it was accepted as clear that the False Claims Act was directed \u201cat natural persons.\u201d Id. at 782, 120 S.Ct. 1858.\n\n\n. It unsuccessfully argued to the Eleventh Circuit that the False Claims Act \u201ccontained a general exclusion against all government employees as qui tam plaintiffs.\u201d Williams, 931 F.2d at 1502.\n\n\n. Shell claims that those \"who are paid to investigate and report fraud and who then seek to file qui tam suits based on information they developed for the government\u201d may not be False Claims Act relators. The United States's proposed construction sweeps a bit more broadly. It would prohibit suits by any \"government employee who obtains information about fraud in the course of his official duties.\u201d\n\n\n. The crime statute on its face pertains only to interested-official acts. It bars employees from participating \"through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation\u201d when the \"judicial or other proceeding, application, [or] request for a ruling\u201d is one in which they have a financial interest. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. Section 2635.101(b)(3) prohibits the \"improper use\u201d of nonpublic information to further private interest, and various provisos bar employees from \"participating personally and substantially in an official capacity\u201d in matters in which they have a financial interest. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2635.402(a). The regulation on misuse of government property does not facially encompass facts learned at work, except in the case of intellectual property that has been purchased. See \u00a7 2635.704(b)(1) (\"Government property includes any form of real or personal property in which the Government has an ownership, leasehold, or other property interest as well as any right or other intangible interest that is purchased with Government funds .... \u201d).\n\n\n. It has been noted that even when legislation expressly references other law, an interpreting court should not assume that because \"the reference makes discovery of the prior *290act possible,\u201d such a discovery necessarily has occurred. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.1, at 203. In the False Claims Act, there is not even that type of cross-reference.\n\n\n. See United States ex rel. Alderson v. Quorum Health Grp. Inc., 171 F.Supp.2d 1323, 1333-34 &amp; n. 33 (M.D.Fla.2001); United States ex rel. Johnson-Pochardt v. Rapid City Reg\u2019l Hosp., 252 F.Supp.2d 892, 899 n. 2 (D.S.D.2003).\n\n\n. These types of arguments can be found in the literature on the Act. See, e.g., Barry M. Landy, Note, Deterring Fraud to Increase Public Confidence: Why Congress Should Allow Government Employees to File Qui Tam Lawsuits, 94 Minn. L.Rev. 1239, 1256-64 (2010); David Wallace, Government Employees as Qui Tam Relators, 1996-Aug. Army Law. 14, 21-22 (1996); Joan R. Bullock, The Pebble in the Shoe: Malting the Case for the Government Employee, 60 Tenn. L.Rev. 365 (1993).\n\n\n. These observations and the following analysis pertain to Section 3730(e)(4) before its amendment in 2010 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 199, 901, \u00a7 10104(j)(2) (Mar. 23, 2010). This suit has been pending since 2006 and the text is not retroactively applicable. See McKesson, 649 F.3d at 326 n. 6.\n\n",
