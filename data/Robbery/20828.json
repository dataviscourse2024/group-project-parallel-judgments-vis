CHRISTOPHER LOYD DAVIS\n\n                  Appeal from the Circuit Court for Hardin County\n                     No. 9807     Charles C. McGinley, Judge\n\n\n\n\n               No. W2014-02101-CCA-R3-CD - Filed October 5, 2015\n                        _____________________________\n\nDefendant, Christopher Loyd Davis, was indicted for theft of property valued over\n$10,000. After a trial, Defendant was found guilty of theft. The jury verdict form\nreflects a conviction for theft of property valued over $1000 but less than $10,000, a\nClass D felony. The judgment form reflects a Class C felony theft conviction with a\nsentence of twelve years in incarceration as a Career Offender. After the denial of a\nmotion for new trial, Defendant appealed, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport the conviction, that the State failed to prove the value of the property, that the\ntrial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence, that the trial court erred in denying a jury\ninstruction on ignorance or mistake of fact, and that the trial court erred by having\nextrajudicial communication with the jury. After our review of the record and applicable\nauthorities, we conclude that the judgments do not properly reflect the jury\u201fs verdict.\nTherefore, we affirm the conviction and remand the case for entry of a corrected\njudgment.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed in\n                             Part, Remanded in Part\n\nTIMOTHY L. EASTER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which JAMES CURWOOD\nWITT, JR., and ROGER A. PAGE, JJ., joined.\n\nGuy T. Wilkinson, District Public Defender; and Frankie K. Stanfill, Assistant Public\nDefender, for the appellant, Christopher Loyd Davis.\n\nHerbert H. Slatery III, Attorney General and Reporter; Clarence E. Lutz, Senior Counsel;\nMatthew Stowe, District Attorney General; and Joshua Turnbow, Assistant District\nAttorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\f                                            OPINION\n\n       This is Defendant\u201fs direct appeal of his conviction for theft of property valued\nover $1000 but less than $10,000 from the Circuit Court of Hardin County.\n\n       In November of 2013, the grand jury returned an indictment charging both\nDefendant and Gunner L. Williams with theft of property valued more than $10,000 but\nless than $60,000. The indictment was based on the burglary of A&G Trucking in\nCrump, Tennessee, during which multiple pieces of jewelry belonging to Peggy Sue\nMaxwell were stolen. Defendant and the co-defendant allegedly sold most of the jewelry\nto Morgan & Company Jewelry Store in Savannah, Tennessee, for a total of $890.\n\n       On July 24, 2013, Ms. Maxwell arrived at her place of employment, A&G\nTrucking, to find her office \u201ctorn apart.\u201d The first thing she did was check her desk\ndrawer. Ms. Maxwell had locked her jewelry in her desk drawer the night before with the\nintent of taking it to her lock box at the bank. Ms. Maxwell explained that she had\nrecently taken in a \u201chomeless family\u201d to live with her temporarily and removed her\njewelry from the house so that she \u201cwasn\u201ft putting [herself] in a position that was going\nto end up with [her] losing [her] family heirloom[s].\u201d\n\n       Ms. Maxwell called the police. Chief Jeff Plunk of the Crump Police Department\nresponded to the call, making a list of the items stolen. According to Ms. Maxwell, they\nincluded: (1) a sapphire and diamond ring given to Ms. Maxwell by her mother on her\n30th birthday, with an uncertain market value but a $15,000 \u201cemotional value\u201d; (2) an\namethyst and diamond ring, valued at approximately $300; (3) a diamond and sapphire\nring, valued at approximately $1200; (4) a diamond cluster ring, valued at \u201caround\n$600\u201d; (5) her great-grandmother\u201fs wedding ring, valued at approximately $100; (6) three\ndiamond wedding bands, valued at approximately $150 to $200 each; (7) a loose\ndiamond stone, valued at $900;1 (8) \u201cthree other sets of diamond earrings\u201d; (9) a gold\nchain, valued at $100; (10) two diamond bracelets, valued at approximately $600 each;\n(11) a diamond necklace, valued around $500 or $600; (12) a diamond necklace, valued\nat approximately $1000; (13) one loose diamond, value unspecified; (14) her\ngrandmother\u201fs wedding set, value unspecified; (15) an antique Omega watch, value\nunspecified; and (16) one diamond earring, value unspecified. All values given for\nproperty stolen were estimated by Ms. Maxwell. She did not produce receipts or\nappraisals of the jewelry.\n\n       Chief Crump notified the Hardin County Sheriff\u201fs Department (\u201cHCSD\u201d) of the\nburglary. Investigator Keith Amos of the HCSD recovered some of the stolen items from\n\n       1\n         The loose stone was located underneath the drawer in her office in a \u201clittle plastic baggy.\u201d\nAdditionally, a diamond earring was found \u201cin the back office where they went out the window.\u201d\n                                                  -2-\n\fMorgan & Company Jewelers in Savannah. According to Autumn Powers, an employee\nat Morgan & Company Jewelers, Defendant sold several of the pieces to the store.\nSeveral others were sold to the store by co-defendant Gunner Williams. Defendant\nsigned the purchase log at the store and provided his driver\u201fs license during the sale.\nDefendant received $730 for the jewelry that he brought in to the store. The amount\nreceived by Defendant was calculated based on \u201cpure gold weight\u201d or \u201cscrap gold.\u201d Ms.\nPowers estimated that the market value of the jewelry would be much higher. All of the\njewelry stolen from A&G Trucking was recovered except a diamond necklace, one\ndiamond band, one loose diamond, Ms. Maxwell\u201fs grandmother\u201fs wedding set, the\nantique watch, one pair of HD earrings2, and one diamond earring. Ms. Maxwell was\nalso missing a personal laptop and a laptop case. According to Ms. Maxwell, all of the\nmissing, unrecovered items had a combined approximate value of $4000.\n\n        Prior to trial, co-defendant Williams entered a guilty plea to theft of property\nvalued over $10,000. Williams testified for the State that on the day of the incident,\nDefendant invited him to swim at the motel where Defendant was staying with his\ngirlfriend, Paula Cook. As Williams was changing clothes in the motel room, he found\nthe bag of jewelry. Williams took a diamond bracelet and ring from the bag and sold\nthem to Morgan & Company the next day.\n\n        Paula Cook testified that she was dating Defendant in July of 2013. At trial, she\ntestified that she overheard a telephone conversation between Defendant and his brother,\nLoyd3 Davis, about some jewelry. She admitted that she went with Defendant to Morgan\n& Company sometime in July and that she was staying with Defendant at the motel in\nCrump on the date of the incident.\n\n        Loyd Davis testified for the defense that he visited his brother at the motel and\nnever saw any jewelry. He recalled having a discussion about money with Defendant at\nhis own apartment, Aspen Apartments. Loyd Davis owed his brother between $50-100 at\nthat time. Loyd Davis, a roofer, claimed that he was occasionally paid in jewelry by his\nboss. Loyd Davis testified that he gave the jewelry to Defendant to pay off the debt. He\nstated that it was not the \u201cfirst time that [Defendant had] seen [him] with jewelry.\u201d Loyd\nDavis insisted that he did not tell Defendant that the jewelry was stolen even though he\nknew it was stolen from A & G Trucking.4 Loyd Davis claimed that he could not\n\n        2\n           It is not clear from the record why these earrings are not in the original list of stolen property.\nWe can only surmise that they may, in fact, be one of the \u201cthree pairs of diamond earrings\u201d that were\nlisted as stolen.\n        3\n         Mr. Davis\u201fs name is spelled \u201cLoyd\u201d and \u201cLloyd\u201d in the record on appeal. We will refer to him\nas \u201cLoyd Davis\u201d in order to distinguish him from Defendant.\n        4\n            Loyd Davis did not testify exactly how he knew the jewelry was stolen.\n                                                     -3-\n\fdescribe the jewelry that he gave to his brother to satisfy the debt. He admitted that he\nwas currently incarcerated for \u201c[a] bunch of different stuff,\u201d including \u201csome aggravated\nburglaries, theft over a thousand, a drug charge,\u201d and that he had several prior theft-\nrelated convictions.\n\n       The record on appeal does not contain a transcript of the jury\u201fs verdict or the\nsentencing hearing. The record does contain the jury verdict form reflecting that the jury\nfound Defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of theft of property valued over\n$1000 but less than $10,000, a Class D felony. The pre-sentence report included in the\nrecord states Defendant was found guilty of \u201cthe lesser offense of theft of property,\nbetween $1,000 and $10,000.\u201d The judgment form, however, indicates that Defendant\nwas found guilty as indicted of theft of property valued from $10,000 to $60,000, a Class\nC felony. The trial court sentenced Defendant to twelve years as a Career Offender.\n\n       The trial court denied a timely filed motion for new trial. On appeal, Defendant\npresents the following issues for our review: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to\nsupport the conviction; (2) whether the State failed to prove the value of the stolen\nproperty; (3) whether the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on ignorance or\nmistake of fact; (4) whether the trial court erred by allowing Paula Cook to testify about a\nstatement made by Defendant during a telephone conversation between Defendant and\nLoyd Davis; and (5) whether the trial court had extrajudicial communication with the\njury.\n\n                       Discrepancy Between Judgment and Verdict\n\n       Initially, while not pointed out by either party, we note that there is a discrepancy\nbetween the verdict of the jury and the judgment form ultimately entered by the trial\ncourt. This Court has been able to discern from the record that Defendant was indicted\nfor theft of property valued between $10,000 and $60,000, a Class C felony, and the jury\nfound him guilty of theft of property valued between $1000 and $10,000, a Class D\nfelony. The judgment form, however, reflects a conviction for Class C felony theft rather\nthan the Class D felony theft found by the jury. Therefore, we must remand the matter\nfor correction of the judgment form to reflect a conviction for Class D felony theft.\n\n       Along with the incorrect conviction offense on the judgment form, the trial court\nsentenced Defendant as a Career Offender to twelve years for the Class C felony.\nCompounding matters further, the record does not contain the transcript of the sentencing\nhearing. We note that as a Career Offender convicted of a Class D felony, Defendant\nshould have received a sentence of twelve years. See \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-112(c)(3), (4); 40-35-\n108(c). Upon remand, the new judgment form should reflect a conviction for a Class D\nfelony and a sentence of twelve years.\n\n                                            -4-\n\f                   Sufficiency of the Evidence & Value of the Property\n\n       On appeal, Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. The brief\nsubmitted on appeal states the law with regard to sufficiency of the evidence and recaps\nthe basic facts from the trial without actually analyzing why the evidence should be\nconsidered insufficient to support the conviction. In a separate issue, however,\nDefendant challenges the State\u201fs proof with regard to value. Specifically, Defendant\npoints to Ms. Maxwell\u201fs testimony wherein she admitted that she did not know the\nmarket value of a ring and that the value she placed on one of the rings was a\n\u201cguesstimation.\u201d Therefore, he concludes, Defendant\u201fs conviction should be modified to\ntheft of property valued over $500. The State argues that the proof showed that\nDefendant exercised control over recently stolen property that was estimated to be valued\nat more than $10,000.\n\n       When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court is obliged\nto review that claim according to certain well-settled principles. A guilty verdict removes\nthe presumption of innocence and replaces it with a presumption of guilt. State v. Evans,\n838 S.W.2d 185, 191 (Tenn. 1992). The burden is then shifted to the defendant on appeal\nto demonstrate why the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction. State v.\nTuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). The relevant question the reviewing court\nmust answer is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the accused guilty of\nevery element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e);\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979). On appeal, \u201cthe State is entitled to the\nstrongest legitimate view of the evidence and to all reasonable and legitimate inferences\nthat may be drawn therefrom.\u201d State v. Elkins, 102 S.W.3d 578, 581 (Tenn. 2003). As\nsuch, this Court is precluded from re-weighing or reconsidering the evidence when\nevaluating the convicting proof. State v. Morgan, 929 S.W.2d 380, 383 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1996); State v. Matthews, 805 S.W.2d 776, 779 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990).\nMoreover, we may not substitute our own \u201cinferences for those drawn by the trier of fact\nfrom circumstantial evidence.\u201d Matthews, 805 S.W.2d at 779. Further, questions\nconcerning the credibility of the witnesses and the weight and value to be given to\nevidence, as well as all factual issues raised by such evidence, are resolved by the trier of\nfact and not the appellate courts. State v. Pruett, 788 S.W.2d 559, 561 (Tenn. 1990).\n\u201cThe standard of review \u201eis the same whether the conviction is based upon direct or\ncircumstantial evidence.\u201f\u201d State v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d 370, 379 (Tenn. 2011)\n(quoting State v. Hanson, 279 S.W.3d 265, 275 (Tenn. 2009)).\n\n       Under Tennessee law, a person commits theft of property if, with intent to deprive\nthe owner of property, the person knowingly obtains or exercises control over the\nproperty without the owner\u201fs effective consent. T.C.A. \u00a7 39-14-103(a). \u201cA person acts\nknowingly with respect to a result of the person\u201fs conduct when the person is aware that\nthe conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-11-302(b). Moreover,\n                                            -5-\n\fa defendant\u201fs recent possession of the stolen property, unless satisfactorily explained, is a\ncircumstance from which a jury could reasonably infer that the defendant had knowledge\nthat the property had been stolen. See State v. James, 315 S.W.3d 440, 450-51 (Tenn.\n2010).\n\n        To sustain Defendant\u201fs Class D felony theft conviction, the State must prove the\naforementioned and that the value of the property was over $1000 but less than $10,000.\nT.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 39-14-103(a), 39-14-105(3). Tennessee Code Annotated defines \u201cvalue\u201d as\n\u201c(i) The fair market value of the property or service at the time and place of the offense;\nor (ii) If the fair market value of the property cannot be ascertained, the cost of replacing\nthe property within a reasonable time after the offense[.]\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-11-106(a)(36)(A).\nOur supreme court has held that \u201c[t]he market value of the article stolen, and not its\noriginal cost, is the true criterion when it is necessary to establish the value of the\nproperty in order to fix the grade of the offense[.]\u201d State v. Hamm, 611 S.W.2d 826, 829\n(Tenn. 1981); see also State v. James Edgar Leverette, No. M2009-01286-CCA-R3-CD,\n2010 WL 2943290, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jul. 26, 2010), no perm. app. filed; State v.\nEddie H. Pittman, No. W2009-02316-CCA-R3-CD, 2011 WL 856382, at *3 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Mar. 10, 2011), no perm. app. filed; State v. Rodger Watts, No. W2010-\n00705-CCA-R3CD, 2011 WL 1220766, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 31, 2011), no\nperm. app. filed; State v. Alton Tappan, No. W2006-00168-CCA-R3CD, 2007 WL\n1556657, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 29, 2007), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Aug. 20,\n2007). If the value of the property cannot be ascertained by the aforementioned criteria,\nthe property is deemed to have a value of less than fifty dollars. Id. \u00a7 39-11-\n106(a)(36)(C). The fair market value of the stolen property is a question of fact for the\njury. Hamm, 611 S.W.2d at 828-29.\n\n       Looking at the facts in a light most favorable to the State, it is undisputed that\nwithin a day of the burglary of A&G Trucking, Defendant was in possession of the\njewelry that was stolen from Ms. Maxwell\u201fs desk. Defendant was identified by the\nemployee of Morgan & Company Jewelers as one of the people who came in to sell the\njewelry in exchange for $730. Defendant\u201fs brother, a convicted felon, testified that he\ngot the jewelry as payment for a roofing job and gave the jewelry to Defendant to repay a\npersonal debt. Loyd Davis knew the property was stolen but did not avail his brother of\nthis information. The jury was presented with this information and chose to assess\ncredibility in favor of the State\u201fs witnesses. Further, Ms. Maxwell testified as to the\napproximate value of the majority of the items stolen, including a ring worth $300, a\ndiamond cluster ring worth $600, two diamond bands worth $150 each, a diamond and\nsapphire ring worth $1200, a wedding ring worth $100, a gold chain worth $100, two\ndiamond bracelets worth $600 each, a diamond necklace worth $500, and a diamond\nnecklace worth $1000. Ms. Maxwell also testified that she owned a sapphire and\ndiamond ring worth $15,000 but testified that this was her \u201cguesstimation\u201d of the\nemotional value of the item because it was given to her by a family member. Tennessee\n                                            -6-\n\fRule of Evidence 701(b) permits the owner of personal property to testify about the value\nof that property. See Tenn. R. Evid. 701(b) (\u201cA witness may testify to the value of the\nwitness\u201fs own property or services.\u201d); Reaves v. State, 523 S.W.2d 218, 220 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1975). Moreover, the scrap value of the items has little bearing on either the fair\nmarket value or the replacement value. Notwithstanding the emotional value placed on\nthe sapphire and diamond ring, Ms. Maxwell testified that the replacement value of the\nremaining items exceeded $5000. The jury accredited Ms. Maxwell\u201fs valuation, as was\nits prerogative. See Hamm, 611 S.W.2d at 828-29 (holding that it is up to the jury to\ndetermine the value of the items stolen). Under these circumstances, the evidence was\nsufficient to support the defendant\u201fs convictions. Defendant is not entitled to relief on\nthis issue.\n\n                                         Hearsay\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court erred by refusing to allow Ms. Cook to fully\ntestify about a telephone conversation she overheard between Defendant and his brother\nabout some jewelry wherein Loyd Davis informed Defendant that the jewelry was to\nsatisfy some type of debt. When the State objected to the statement, the trial court\nsustained the objection, opining that the statement would be self-serving. Defendant did\nnot make an offer of proof with respect to the excluded testimony. He now asserts on\nappeal that the statement \u201cshould have been allowed to show Defendant\u201fs present mental\ncondition pursuant to Tennessee Rules of Evidence 803(3).\u201d Save citing the rule,\nDefendant presents no other argument or authority to support his position.\n\n        The question of whether a statement fits under one of the exceptions to the hearsay\nrule is a question of law and subject to de novo review by this Court. Kendrick v. State,\n454 S.W.3d 450, 479 (Tenn. 2015).\n\n        Tennessee Rule of Evidence 802 excludes relevant evidence if it is hearsay.\n\u201c\u201eHearsay\u201f is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying . . .\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Tenn. R. Evid. 801(c).\nWhile we certainly acknowledge that any testimony by Ms. Cook summarizing a\ntelephone conversation she overheard between Defendant and his brother would be\nhearsay, we decline to comment on whether it would satisfy an exception to the hearsay\nrule. Because of the failure of Defendant to make an offer of proof as to the substance of\nthe statement, we are unable to review this issue as there is no testimony in the record to\nreview. Tenn. R. Evid. 103(a)(2). Additionally, the statement sought by Defendant was\nessentially introduced through the testimony of Loyd Davis, making any error in the trial\ncourt\u201fs ruling harmless.\n\n       Moreover, Rule 27(a)(7) of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure provides\nin part that a brief shall contain \u201c[a]n argument . . . setting forth the contentions of the\n                                            -7-\n\fappellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, including the\nreasons why the contentions require appellate relief, with citations to the authorities and\nappropriate references to the record . . . relied on.\u201d Rule 10(b) of this Court provides that\n\u201c[i]ssues which are not supported by argument, citation to authorities, or appropriate\nreferences to the record will be treated as waived in this court.\u201d Tenn. Ct. Crim. App.\n10(b). Consequently, this issue is waived.\n\n                                     Jury Instructions\n\n       Next, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his request to instruct\nthe jury on the defense of ignorance or mistake of fact as outlined in Tennessee Pattern\nJury Instruction 40.01. Defendant argues that, from the proof at trial, a reasonable jury\ncould conclude that Defendant did not know that the jewelry was stolen, given the fact\nthat his brother testified that he did not tell Defendant as much. The State argues that\nDefendant failed to request the instruction in writing and did not provide the jury\ninstructions for our review on appeal. We agree with the State.\n\n        \u201c[A] defendant has a right to a correct and complete charge of the law,\u201d State v.\nFarner, 66 S.W.3d 188, 204 (Tenn. 2001), and the trial court has the duty to give \u201ca\ncomplete charge of the law applicable to the facts of the case.\u201d State v. Davenport, 973\nS.W.2d 283, 287 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1998). When the defendant raises an issue with\nregard to an omitted instruction, we must review the entire jury charge to determine \u201cif,\nwhen read as a whole, it fails to fairly submit the legal issues or misleads the jury as to\nthe applicable law.\u201d State v. Phipps, 883 S.W.2d 138, 142 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994)\n(citing In re Estate of Elam, 738 S.W.2d 169, 174 (Tenn.1987)). Therefore, a defendant\nmay waive an issue regarding the failure to issue a jury instruction by not including an\nadequate record for appellate review. See State v. William Ray Boatwright, No. E2012-\n00688-CCA-R3-CD, 2013 WL 775787, at *8 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 28, 2013), perm.\napp. denied (Tenn. June 12, 2013). It is the defendant\u201fs duty \u201cto prepare a record which\nconveys a fair, accurate and complete account of what transpired with respect to the\nissues [that] form the basis of the appeal.\u201d State v. Taylor, 992 S.W.2d 941, 944 (Tenn.\n1999); see Tenn. R. App. P. 24(b). When necessary parts of the record are not included,\nwe must presume that the trial court\u201fs ruling was correct. See State v. Oody, 823 S.W.2d\n554, 559 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991).\n\n       Defendant has failed to include a copy of the jury instructions in the record before\nus. The only references to the proposed instruction on ignorance or mistake of fact in the\nrecord are the request of counsel at the close of Defendant\u201fs proof regarding whether the\ninstruction was warranted in this case and the trial court\u201fs statement, \u201cour jury charge\nadequately cover[s] everything, so your motion to charge that will be overruled.\u201d As\npreviously stated, it is Defendant\u201fs duty to prepare an adequate record on appeal. The\n\n                                            -8-\n\fjury instructions are not included in the record, precluding appellate review of this issue.\nTherefore, this issue has been waived.\n\n                         Extrajudicial Communication with Jury\n\n       Finally, Defendant complains that the trial court erred by failing to poll the jury to\ndetermine if they overheard a third party request to speak to Defendant about a theft in\nanother county. There is nothing in the record to indicate that this event even happened,\nmuch less that it prejudiced the jury or affected Defendant\u201fs \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d Without\na record of the alleged incident, we are unable to review it for error. Defendant has failed\nto make appropriate references to the record in his appellate brief. See Tenn. R. App. P.\n27(a)(7) and (g); Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b).\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n        Because we conclude that the judgments do not properly reflect the jury\u201fs verdict,\nthe matter must be remanded to the trial court for correction of the judgment forms to\nreflect a conviction for theft of property valued over $1000 but less than $10,000, a Class\nD felony, and sentence of twelve years as a Career Offender. In all other respects, the\njudgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                  _________________________________\n                                                  TIMOTHY L.
