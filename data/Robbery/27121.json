Helman, Assistant Deputy Public Defender,\n                   argued the cause for appellant (Joseph E. Krakora,\n                   Public Defender, attorney; Douglas R. Helman, of\n                   counsel and on the briefs).\n\n                   Regina M. Oberholzer, Deputy Attorney General,\n                   argued the cause for respondent (Gurbir S. Grewal,\n                   Attorney General, attorney; Regina M. Oberholzer, of\n                   counsel and on the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\f      Defendant Alon B. Rolls appeals from an increased sentence imposed\n\nfollowing our remand to reconsider his sentence in light of State v. Shaw, 131\n\nN.J. 1 (1993). We reverse and remand.\n\n      The relevant facts and procedural history are not in dispute. An Atlantic\n\nCounty Grand Jury returned Indictment No. 15-12-2996, charging defendant\n\nwith first-degree robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1(a)(1) (count one); and third-degree\n\npossession with intent to distribute an imitation controlled dangerous substance\n\n(CDS), N.J.S.A. 2C:35-11(a) (count two). The grand jury subsequently returned\n\nIndictment No. 16-03-0622, charging defendant and six others with an unrelated\n\nthird-degree theft by deception, N.J.S.A. 2C:20-4 and N.J.S.A. 2C:2-6.\n\n      On February 13, 2017, defendant pleaded guilty to count one of\n\nIndictment No. 15-12-2996, amended to second-degree robbery, and the only\n\ncount of Indictment No. 16-03-0622. In exchange, the State agreed to dismiss\n\ncount two of Indictment No. 15-12-2996 and to recommend a third-degree range\n\nsentence of a three-year term, subject to an eighty-five percent parole\n\ndisqualifier pursuant to the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2,\n\non the robbery conviction, and a concurrent three-year flat term on the theft by\n\ndeception conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-4821-18T1\n                                       2\n\f      During the plea colloquy, the State acknowledged its recommendation of\n\na three-year NERA term on the robbery count and a concurrent three-year flat\n\nterm on the theft count. The trial court accepted the plea, finding it was entered\n\nfreely, knowingly, and voluntarily, and that defendant understood the sentence\n\nto be imposed. At defendant's request, the court agreed to delay sentencing\n\nbecause defendant had a newborn child and was supporting his family.\n\n      When he appeared for sentencing on May 19, 2017, defendant requested\n\na further postponement because he was recently employed and wanted to \"have\n\na few more weeks to again keep his family financially afloat.\" The judge\n\nstated,\"[i]f I were to grant it, it would be on the condition of [a] no show/no\n\nrecommendation.\" The following colloquy then took place:\n\n            THE COURT: I'll give you an opportunity to have a\n            few more weeks on the street to take care of business,\n            but it's on this condition. You got to come back on the\n            day I'm about to give you. If you don't, then no hard\n            feelings but \u2013\n\n            THE DEFENDANT: I'll give you my word, I'll be here.\n\n            THE COURT: Just want you to understand the State\n            can indict you for bail jumping and then when they\n            bring you back I can sentence you as I see fit. It might\n            be [three years] at [eight-five percent], it might be\n            more. So you understand that, sir?\n\n            THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\n\n                                                                         A-4821-18T1\n                                        3\n\f              THE COURT: Let's postpone the matter [to] June 30th,\n              [with a] no show/no recommendation.\n\n      Notably, the State did not request the no show/no recommendation\n\ncondition\u2014it was not discussed during the plea negotiations, does not appear in\n\nthe plea form, and was not mentioned at the plea hearing. Moreover, the plea\n\nagreement was never formally amended.\n\n      Defendant appeared for his next sentencing date, June 30, 2017, and\n\nrequested another postponement due to his family situation, including his then\n\npregnant fianc\u00e9e. He claimed to be working seventy hours per week. The State\n\ndeferred.     The court initially agreed to the postponement contingent upon\n\ndefendant submitting to a substance evaluation and testing clean. Although\n\ndefendant admitted he would test positive for marijuana, the court postponed\n\nsentencing to August 18, 2017, and stated, \"[h]e continues on the no show/no\n\nrecommendation, no new charges and no dope.\"\n\n      Defendant did not appear for sentencing on August 18, allegedly because\n\nhe was in the hospital. The court issued a bench warrant for defendant who\n\nremained a fugitive until arrested four months later by the Unites States\n\nMarshals Service Regional Fugitive Task Force.\n\n      On February 9, 2018, defendant appeared before a different judge for\n\nsentencing.     Defense counsel requested that defendant be sentenced in\n\n                                                                       A-4821-18T1\n                                       4\n\faccordance with the plea agreement, despite having not appeared for sentencing.\n\nThe State likewise moved for sentencing in accordance with the plea agreement.\n\nIt left the impact of no show/no recommendation condition in the court's\n\ndiscretion.\n\n      Defense counsel explained the court's intention to defendant and reviewed\n\nwith him a transcript setting forth the no show/no recommendation condition.\n\nWhen asked by the court if defendant was ready to proceed, defense counsel\n\nstated, \"I advised [defendant] of what the [c]ourt's intentions are and we're\n\nprepared to go forward.\"\n\n      Notably, the court found the original written plea bargain was in the\n\ninterest of justice and presumed to be reasonable. The court nevertheless took\n\nthe \"position, that when a defendant is advised that they are to be here for\n\nsentencing and they know it's no show/no [recommendation], there's an\n\nenhanced penalty for not showing up.\" After noting defendant had not sought a\n\nfurther postponement of the June 30, 2017 sentencing date, the court stated it\n\nwas not imposing the recommended sentence. The court stated it intended to\n\nimpose an extra year on the robbery count.\n\n      The court noted defendant had incurred fourteen arrests, resulting in five\n\nindictable and four municipal court convictions, relating to theft and CDS\n\n\n                                                                        A-4821-18T1\n                                       5\n\foffenses. The court further noted defendant had served a prison term, been\n\nparoled, and violated parole. The court also stated defendant had a significant\n\njuvenile record, with six adjudications of juvenile delinquency, and served a\n\nterm of juvenile detention. The court found aggravating factors three (risk of\n\nre-offense), six (prior criminal record), and nine (need for deterrence), N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:44-1(a)(3), (6), and (9), outweighed the nonexistent mitigating factors.\n\n      Based on the no show/no recommendation condition, the court sentenced\n\ndefendant to concurrent four-year NERA terms on the robbery and theft by\n\ndeception counts and imposed appropriate assessments.1 The remaining charges\n\nwere dismissed.\n\n      Defendant appealed his sentence before an excessive sentencing panel.\n\nWe remanded \"for reconsideration of defendant's sentence in light of State v.\n\nShaw, a case we discuss infra in Part II(A).\"\n\n      The trial court held a Shaw hearing on May 10, 2019. Defendant testified\n\nhis wife was pregnant, he was working to support his family, his father was ill,\n\nand ultimately passed away. Defendant admitted knowing he was supposed to\n\nappear for court but decided he \"could not just leave his wife and children\n\n\n\n1\n  As discussed infra in Part II(B), third-degree theft by deception is not a NERA\noffense. See N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2(a), (d).\n                                                                         A-4821-18T1\n                                        6\n\fabandoned like that.\"    He also stated attempts to reach his attorney were\n\nunsuccessful. Defendant stated that he tried to speak to his attorney to request\n\nadditional time but his attorney would not accept his calls or respond to his text\n\nmessages because he missed a payment. This led to defendant changing defense\n\ncounsel; however, court records revealed his original attorney appeared in court\n\non the rescheduled sentencing date.\n\n      The court made the following findings at the resentencing following the\n\nShaw hearing: \"imposing a [four]-year term of incarceration on the robbery\n\ncharge was significant, but not shocking, because defendant pled guilty to a\n\nsecond[-]degree crime, but was sentenced in the third[-]degree\" and it was\n\nappropriate to increase the sentence by one year, thereby keeping the sentence\n\nin the third-degree range. The court also found defendant was aware of the no\n\nshow/no recommendation condition.\n\n      The court concluded that defendant's \"conscious decision\" not to appear\n\nfor sentencing was \"unacceptable.\" The court stated \"[d]efendant broke the trust\n\nthat was placed in him\" and \"must now suffer the consequences of his deliberate\n\nfailure and conscious refusal to appear for sentencing under the no show/no\n\nrecommendation provision.\"       The court noted defendant's criminal record\n\nmilitated against downgrading the robbery count for sentencing purposes. It\n\n\n                                                                         A-4821-18T1\n                                        7\n\fconcluded the non-existent mitigating factors did not outweigh the aggravating\n\nfactors.   The court reasoned that a sentencing downgrade was no longer\n\nwarranted because \"the requirements of N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(f)(2) had not been\n\nsatisfied.\" Thus, \"defendant must be sentenced in the second[-]degree range.\"\n\n      The court decided to increase the penalty for the failure to appear from\n\none to two years and resentenced defendant to a five-year NERA term on the\n\nrobbery count. It decreased the sentence on the theft by deception count to a\n\nconcurrent three-year NERA term. This appeal followed.\n\n      Defendant raises the following points:\n\n            POINT I\n            THE NO SHOW PROVISION WAS NEVER\n            INCORPORATED INTO [DEFENDANT'S] PLEA\n            AGREEMENT BY THE STATE AND IS\n            THEREFORE INVALID.\n\n            POINT II [2]\n            IMPOSING     AN ADDITIONAL   YEAR   OF\n            INCARCERATION     AFTER    [DEFENDANT]\n            VINDICATED HIS RIGHT TO APPEAL IS A\n            FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF HIS DUE PROCESS\n            AND DOUBLE JEOPARDY RIGHTS (Not Raised\n            Below).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  As we discuss infra, the State does not oppose a remand on the issue of the\nadditional fifth year.\n                                                                       A-4821-18T1\n                                       8\n\f      Generally, we review a criminal sentence for abuse of discretion. State v.\n\nJones, 232 N.J. 308, 318 (2018).        Our role in reviewing a sentence is to\n\ndetermine:\n\n             (1) whether the exercise of discretion by the sentencing\n             court was based upon findings of fact grounded in\n             competent, reasonably credible evidence; (2) whether\n             the sentencing court applied the correct legal principles\n             in exercising its discretion; and (3) whether the\n             application of the facts to the law was such a clear error\n             of judgment that it shocks the [judicial] conscience.\n\n             [State v. Megargel, 143 N.J. 484, 493 (1996) (citing\n             State v. Roth, 95 N.J. 334, 363-65 (1984)).]\n\n      \"We may exercise our original jurisdiction to impose a new sentence\n\nwhere no further factfinding is required . . . .\" State v. L.V., 410 N.J. Super. 90,\n\n109 (App. Div. 2009) (citing State v. Kromphold, 162 N.J. 345, 355 (2000)); see\n\nalso R. 2:10-3.\n\n                                        A.\n\n      The trial court unilaterally imposed a no show/no recommendation\n\ncondition that was neither part of the plea agreement nor requested by the State.\n\nAt sentencing, the State did not request imposition of an increased sentence.\n\n      \"The [c]ourt found that imposing a [four]-year term of incarceration on\n\nthe robbery charge was significant, but not shocking, because defendant pled\n\nguilty to a second[-]degree crime, but was sentenced in the third[-]degree\n\n                                                                           A-4821-18T1\n                                         9\n\frange.\" The court determined it appropriate to increase the sentence by one year,\n\nthereby keeping the sentence in the third-degree range. It imposed concurrent\n\nfour-year NERA terms on the robbery and theft by deception counts. The trial\n\ncourt deviated from the recommended sentence solely because defendant failed\n\nto appear for sentencing.\n\n      Defendant's first appeal was heard on a sentencing calendar pursuant to\n\nRule 2:9-11. There, we remanded for reconsideration of defendant's sentence\n\nunder the guidelines adopted in Shaw.\n\n      In Shaw, the defendants faced mandatory minimum terms of\n\nimprisonment for CDS offenses; each failed to appear for sentencing. Id. at 4-\n\n6. In each case, the written plea agreements contained a no show/no waiver of\n\nan otherwise mandatory minimum term. Id. at 3. The Court held \"that when\n\nintegrated under the State v. Vasquez, 129 N.J. 189 (1992), guidelines for valid\n\nlaw-enforcement purposes, a no-appearance/no waiver provision is valid and\n\nenforceable.\" Ibid. (footnote omitted).\n\n      The Court adopted the following guidelines:\n\n            Not every violation of the waiver conditions by an\n            accused defendant will result in automatic imposition\n            of a mandatory sentence. The automatic imposition of\n            enhanced punishment for a non-appearance without\n            holding a hearing or considering an explanation would\n            be unwarranted. The court must provide a fair hearing\n\n                                                                        A-4821-18T1\n                                      10\n\f            to determine whether the violation of the terms of the\n            arrangement warrants its revocation. The process is\n            deliberative, not perfunctory. The court will consider\n            the explanation for the non-appearance in the context\n            of all the circumstances . . . . The court will then\n            determine whether in the circumstances the breach is\n            material to the plea and therefore warrants revocation\n            of the prosecutor's waiver of mandatory sentence.\n\n            [Id. at 16-17 (citation and footnote omitted).]\n\n      Here, the plea agreement did not include a no show/no recommendation\n\ncondition. The State did not seek or urge the court to impose a no show/no\n\nrecommendation condition. Rather, the court unilaterally imposed the condition\n\n(albeit without any objection by the parties) when it granted defendant's request\n\nfor a delay in sentencing.\n\n      When he finally appeared for sentencing following execution of the bench\n\nwarrant, defendant did not move to withdraw his plea and does not seek that\n\nrelief on appeal. Instead, he asked the court to proceed with sentencing and\n\nrequested that he be sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement. He seeks\n\nthe same relief from this court.\n\n      A \"sentence based upon a factor which is unrelated to the sentencing\n\ncriteria set forth in the Code of Criminal Justice\" is improper. State v. Wilson,\n\n206 N.J. Super. 182, 184 (App. Div. 1985) (citing N.J.S.A. 2C:1-1 to 2C:104-\n\n9).   \"Nowhere in the code is it suggested that defendant's appearance for\n\n                                                                        A-4821-18T1\n                                      11\n\fsentence is one of those criteria.\" Ibid. (citing Roth; State v. Hodge, 95 N.J. 369\n\n(1984)); but see State v. Subin, 222 N.J. Super. 227, 237-40 (App. Div. 1988)\n\n(finding the defendant's failure to appear for sentencing was relevant to the risk\n\nof reoffending and the need for deterrence). 3        Although the reasons for\n\ndefendant's failure to appear for sentencing may be considered, those reasons\n\n\"must, however, be relevant to identified sentencing guidelines.\" Wilson, 206\n\nN.J. Super. at 184. A \"sentence based entirely upon nonappearance is an illegal\n\nsentence.\" Ibid.\n\n      \"The trial court must always sentence in accordance with the applicable\n\nsentencing provisions of the Code.\" Subin, 222 N.J. Super. at 239. Here, the\n\ncourt expressed its personal position that failure to appear for sentencing\n\nwarranted an enhanced sentence. \"A sentencing judge's personal views . . .\n\ncannot substitute for the Code's carefully delineated sentencing scheme in this\n\nregard.\" State v. Ikerd, 369 N.J. Super. 610, 621 (App. Div. 2004). Considering\n\n\n3\n  The facts in Subin are distinguishable. In Subin, the plea agreement contained\na condition that if defendant failed to appear for sentencing or was arrested for\na new offense his aggregate sentence would be increased from seven to ten\nyears. Id. at 229. We held \"that the plea agreement was valid and enforceable\nand that the sentence imposed in accordance therewith was legal.\" Id. at 237.\nHere, defendant's plea agreement did not contain a no show/no recommendation\ncondition, much less a specified alternate increased sentence if he failed to\nappear for sentencing. Notably, defendant was not charged with bail jumping\nor committing a new offense while a fugitive.\n                                                                          A-4821-18T1\n                                       12\n\fthe circumstances developed at the Shaw hearing, coupled with the absence of\n\nany new charges against defendant while a fugitive, we conclude that\n\nsubstantially increasing defendant's recommended sentence solely because of\n\nhis failure to appear, by enforcing a unilaterally imposed no show/no\n\nrecommendation, was an abuse of discretion. Adding an additional year of\n\nprison subject to NERA for the failure to appear is not supported by the record\n\nor the plea agreement, even with defendant's criminal history.\n\n      While the sentencing court was free to impose a sentence different from\n\nthe negotiated one, a decision to deviate from the negotiated term had to be\n\nsupported by facts and circumstances related to the underlying crimes and the\n\nstatutory aggravating and mitigating factors, not to defendant's failure to appear.\n\nThe sentencing court's finding that the negotiated term was reasonable and in\n\nthe interest of justice conflicts with its decision to impose a harsher term. The\n\ncourt did not deal separately with punishment for the underlying crimes and\n\ndefendant's arrest for failure to appear. Instead, the court conjoined them and\n\npunished defendant by increasing the negotiated term. The court would have\n\nhad the authority to do so if the plea agreement had been amended, but that did\n\nnot occur here.    We appreciate the court's understandable desire to assure\n\ndefendant's appearance, especially after the court had generously granted him\n\n\n                                                                          A-4821-18T1\n                                       13\n\fmultiple postponements.      But the manner in which the \"no show/no\n\nrecommendation\" condition was imposed and enforced here was procedurally\n\nflawed.\n\n      We reverse the robbery sentence and remand. On remand, the trial court\n\nshall issue an amended judgment on Indictment No. 15-12-2996, reducing\n\ndefendant's prison term on the robbery count to a three-year NERA term.\n\n                                       B.\n\n      For sake of completeness, we also address the one-year longer NERA term\n\nthe court imposed on the robbery count. For the following reasons we hold that\n\nthe increased sentence was illegal and unconstitutional.\n\n      A court may not impose a \"substantially harsher sentence\" on remand if\n\nthe increased sentence is not required by law or is not supported by \"any\n\nevidence of intervening conduct or prior oversight to justify the new sentence.\"\n\nState v. Heisler, 192 N.J. Super. 586, 592-93 (App. Div. 1984); see also State v.\n\nPindale, 279 N.J. Super. 123, 128-30 (App. Div. 1995) (holding trial courts,\n\nresentencing a defendant following remand, must overcome a \"presumption of\n\nvindictiveness\" when imposing a greater sentence than ordered before by\n\npointing to \"specific reasons justifying the increase\"). To hold otherwise would\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        A-4821-18T1\n                                      14\n\feffectively penalize a defendant for exercising his constitutional right to\n\nchallenge his sentence. Heisler, 192 N.J. Super. at 593.\n\n      Defendant's failure to appear for sentencing obviously occurred before he\n\nwas sentenced. Moreover, the trial court had already imposed a longer sentence\n\nthan the plea agreement recommended due to defendant's failure to appear for\n\nsentencing. There is no evidence of any intervening conduct or prior judicial\n\noversight to justify the longer sentence imposed by the remand court. To be\n\nsure, a five-year NERA term is substantially harsher than a four-year NERA\n\nterm. To that extent, the remand court erred by imposing the increased sentence\n\non the robbery count. We note the State on appeal recognizes this is problematic\n\nand does not oppose a remand concerning the imposition of the fifth year.\n\n      In addition, imposing a discretionary sentence on remand that increases\n\nthe aggregate term of imprisonment violates the federal protection against\n\ndouble jeopardy. State v. Rodriguez, 97 N.J. 263, 275 (1984).\n\n                                      C.\n\n      The judgment of conviction on Indictment No. 16-03-0622 states that\n\ndefendant's three-year prison term for the third-degree theft by deception is\n\nsubject to eighty-five percent parole ineligibility and three years of mandatory\n\nparole supervision under NERA. This was error.\n\n\n                                                                        A-4821-18T1\n                                      15\n\f      NERA only applies to enumerated first and second-degree crimes.\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2(a), (d). Where there are convictions for more than one\n\noffense, the judgments should indicate that the eight-five percent parole\n\nineligibility and mandatory parole supervision applies only to NERA-qualified\n\noffenses. Cannel, N.J. Criminal Code Annotated, cmt. 4 on N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2\n\n(2019) (citing State v. Cheung, 328 N.J. Super. 368, 371 (App. Div. 2000)).\n\n      The NERA parole ineligibility and mandatory parole supervision\n\nrequirements do not apply to defendant's conviction for third-degree theft by\n\ndeception. N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2(a), (d). To that extent, that aspect of the sentence\n\nis illegal because it exceeded the penalties authorized by statute. State v.\n\nSchubert, 212 N.J. 295, 308 (2012). An illegal sentence may be corrected at any\n\ntime. State v. Tavares, 286 N.J. Super. 610, 619 (App. Div. 1996). Although\n\nthe parties did not raise this issue, \"a reviewing court is not free to ignore an\n\nillegal sentence,\" State v. Moore, 377 N.J. Super. 445, 450 (App. Div. 2005),\n\nand should correct it, Tavares, 286 N.J. Super. at 619. On remand, the trial court\n\nshall enter an amended judgment of conviction eliminating the NERA parole\n\nineligibility and mandatory parole supervision conditions of the theft by\n\ndeception sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-4821-18T1\n                                       16\n\f      In sum, although we recognize the importance of assuring a defendant's\n\npromised appearance in court, and the absence of objection voiced by defendant\n\nto the unwritten \"no show/no recommendation\" condition, the enhanced\n\npunishment imposed here does not comport with Shaw and related precedent.\n\nWe are also mindful of the detailed justification the trial court expressed in the\n\njudgment of conviction; nevertheless the sentence cannot stand because of the\n\nprocedural flaws we have discussed.\n\n      Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-4821-18T1\n                                       17\n\f",
