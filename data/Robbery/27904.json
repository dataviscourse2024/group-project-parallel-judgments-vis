F16-40242-Q & F16-72166-Q\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                    Before Justices Myers, Partida-Kipness, and Garcia\n                                 Opinion by Justice Myers\n         Appellant was indicted for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,1 and later\n\ncharged by information with theft of property valued at least $2,500 but less than\n\n$30,000,2 a state-jail felony. Appellant pleaded guilty in both cases, and the trial\n\ncourt deferred an adjudication of guilt and placed appellant on deferred adjudication\n\ncommunity supervision for ten years in the aggravated assault case, and five years\n\nin the theft case.\n\n\n\n   1\n       F15-72166-Q; appellate cause number 05-20-00615-CR.\n   2\n       F16-40242-Q; appellate cause number 05-20-00614-CR.\n\f      The State subsequently filed motions to proceed with an adjudication of guilt.\n\nThe trial court held a hearing on the State\u2019s motions, and appellant pleaded true to\n\nthe allegations without a plea agreement. Following the presentation of evidence,\n\nthe trial court found the allegations in the State\u2019s motions true and adjudicated\n\nappellant\u2019s guilt in each case. The trial court sentenced appellant to 180 days in\n\nState jail in the theft case and seven years, TDCJ, in the aggravated assault case.\n\nAppellant filed a motion for new trial in each case, which the trial court overruled\n\nby written order.\n\n      Appellant brings three points of error attacking the alleged denial of her right\n\nof allocution, the disproportionality of the sentence, and the alleged violation of the\n\nrehabilitative objectives of the Texas Penal Code. As modified, we affirm.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\n                             1. Issue One: Allocution\n\n      In her first issue, appellant argues she is entitled to a new sentencing hearing\n\nbecause the trial court violated her common law and/or statutory right to allocution.\n\nThe State replies that this complaint was not preserved, and we agree.\n\n      \u201cAllocution\u201d refers to a trial judge affording a criminal defendant the\n\nopportunity to \u201cpresent his personal plea to the Court in mitigation of punishment\n\nbefore sentence is imposed.\u201d McClintick v. State, 508 S.W.2d 616, 618 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1974) (op. on reh\u2019g). The statutory right is found in article 42.07 of the Texas\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure and requires that the defendant be asked, before\n\n                                         \u20132\u2013\n\fsentence is pronounced, \u201cwhether he has anything to say why the sentence should\n\nnot be pronounced against him.\u201d TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 42.07.\n\n      But to complain on appeal of the denial of the right of allocution\u2014regardless\n\nof whether it is statutory, or one claimed under the common law\u2014a defendant must\n\ntimely object. See Mathis v. State, No. 05-19-01004-CR, 2020 WL 4581650, at *1\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Aug. 10, 2020, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for\n\npublication); Hall v. State, Nos. 05-18-00442 & 443-CR, 2019 WL 3955772, at *1\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Aug. 22, 2019, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for\n\npublication); Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR, 2019 WL 2121051, at *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Dallas May 15, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication);\n\nLoring v. State, No. 05-18-00421-CR, 2019 WL 3282962, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas\n\nJuly 22, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication); see also Gallegos-\n\nPerez v. State, No. 05-16-00015-CR, 2016 WL 6519113, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas\n\nNov. 1, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op.) (not designated for publication); McClintick, 508\n\nS.W.2d at 618)).\n\n       Appellant never asked the trial court for the opportunity to make an allocution\n\nunder article 42.07 or common law, nor did she object to the court\u2019s failure to afford\n\nher the right of allocution. In fact, when the trial court asked defense counsel, at\n\nsentencing, if there was any legal reason why sentence should not be imposed,\n\ncounsel replied, \u201cNo legal reason.\u201d\n\n      We have repeatedly held that a defendant who fails to timely object to the\n\n                                         \u20133\u2013\n\fdenial of his or her right of allocution does not preserve the complaint for appeal.\n\nSee, e.g., Mathis, 2020 WL 4581650, at *2; Nelson, 2019 WL 2121051, at *5.\n\nAlthough appellant filed a motion for new trial in each case, these motions did not\n\ncomplain about any denial of a common law or statutory right to allocution. At\n\nsentencing, appellant had the opportunity to object that the trial court had denied her\n\nany right to allocution. Because she did not do so, she failed to preserve the issue\n\nfor review. See, e.g., Mathis, 2020 WL 4581650, at *2; Nelson, 2019 WL 2121051,\n\nat *5. Accordingly, we deny appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\n                      2. Issues Two and Three: Punishment\n\n      In her second issue, appellant contends the trial court imposed a \u201cgrossly\n\ndisproportionate\u201d punishment in the aggravated assault case, 05-20-00615-CR, and\n\nthereby violated her Eighth Amendment rights. In her third issue, she argues the\n\ntrial court\u2019s sentence of seven years in the aggravated assault case violated the\n\nrehabilitative objectives of the Texas Penal Code. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 1.02.\n\n      To preserve error for appellate review, the record must show the party\n\ncomplaining on appeal made a timely objection that \u201cstated the grounds for the ruling\n\nthat the complaining party sought from the trial court with sufficient specificity to\n\nmake the trial court aware of the complaint.\u201d TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). This\n\nprerequisite applies to a complaint about an allegedly disproportionate or cruel and\n\nunusual sentence, and a complaint that a sentence violates a defendant\u2019s rights under\n\nthe objectives of the Texas Penal Code. See Rhoades v. State, 934 S.W.2d 113, 120\n\n                                         \u20134\u2013\n\f(Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Castaneda v. State, 135 S.W.3d 719, 723 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nDallas 2003, no pet.); see also Davis v. State, 323 S.W.3d 190, 196 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nDallas 2008, pet. ref\u2019d.) (\u201cEven constitutional rights, including the right to be free\n\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, may be waived.\u201d); Mathis, 2020 WL 4581650,\n\nat **2\u20133 (claims that trial court imposed \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d punishments,\n\nthereby violating Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual\n\npunishments and the objectives of the Texas Penal Code, were not preserved for\n\nreview because appellant did not object to the length of her sentences\u2014all within\n\napplicable statutory ranges of punishment\u2014at trial or in motion for new trial); Sims\n\nv. State, No. 05-18-00572-CR, 2019 WL 2266547, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas May\n\n28, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (claim that trial court\n\nviolated Eighth Amendment by imposing grossly disproportionate punishment not\n\npreserved for review because appellant failed to object at time sentence was imposed\n\nor in a motion for new trial).\n\n       Similarly, in this case appellant did not complain about her sentence at trial or\n\nin her motion for new trial. Thus, she failed to preserve her complaints for review.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); Davis, 323 S.W.3d at 196; Castaneda, 135 S.W.3d at\n\n723.\n\n       But even if we were to conclude appellant preserved her complaints for\n\nappellate review, Texas courts have traditionally held that so long as the punishment\n\nis within the range established by the legislature in a valid statute, the punishment\n\n                                          \u20135\u2013\n\fassessed does not violate either the federal or Texas prohibitions against cruel and/or\n\nunusual punishment. See Samuel v. State, 477 S.W.2d 611, 614 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1972) (\u201c[T]his court has frequently stated that where the punishment assessed by the\n\njudge or jury was within the limits prescribed by the statute the punishment is not\n\ncruel and unusual within the constitutional prohibition.\u201d); Grigsby v. State, No. 05-\n\n19-00738-CR, 2020 WL 2847289, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas June 2, 2020. pet. ref\u2019d)\n\n(mem. op., not designated for publication); Hornsby v. State, No. 05-18-00479-CR,\n\n2019 WL 3315448, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas July 24, 2019, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op.,\n\nnot designated for publication).\n\n      A very narrow exception exists that an individual\u2019s sentence may constitute\n\ncruel and unusual punishment, despite falling in the statutory range, if it is grossly\n\ndisproportionate to the offense. See Kim v. State, 283 S.W.3d 473, 475 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nFort Worth 2009, pet. ref\u2019d); Grigsby, 2020 WL 2847289, at *2; Hornsby, 2019 WL\n\n3315448, at *3. To evaluate the proportionality of a sentence, we first make a\n\nthreshold comparison of the gravity of the offense against the severity of the\n\nsentence. Grigsby, 2020 WL 2847289, at *2; Hornsby, 2019 WL 3315448, at *3.\n\nWhen we analyze the gravity of the offense, we examine the harm caused or\n\nthreatened to the victim, the culpability of the offender, and the offender\u2019s prior\n\nadjudicated and unadjudicated offenses. See State v. Simpson, 488 S.W.3d 318, 323\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2016); Grigsby, 2020 WL 2847289, at *2; Hornsby, 2019 WL\n\n3315448, at *3. Only if gross disproportionality is found do we then compare the\n\n                                         \u20136\u2013\n\fsentence to sentences received for similar crimes in this and other jurisdictions.\n\nSimpson, 488 S.W.3d at 323.\n\n      Regarding the objectives of the Texas Penal Code, in addition to the objective\n\nof rehabilitation, the penal code has the stated objectives of deterrence and such\n\npunishment as necessary to prevent likely recurrence of criminal behavior. See TEX.\n\nPENAL CODE \u00a7 1.02(1)(A), (C). A trial court has a great deal of discretion to\n\ndetermine the appropriate punishment in any given case. See Neal v. State, No. 05-\n\n19-00699-CR, 2020 WL 3958192, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas July 13, 2020, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op., not designated for publication) (citing Foster v. State, 525 S.W.3d 898,\n\n911 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2017, pet. ref\u2019d)). As with issues involving claims of\n\nexcessive or disproportionate sentencing, so long as the sentence is within the proper\n\nrange of punishment, as it was here, it will not generally be disturbed on appeal. Id.\n\n      The record shows appellant was charged in 05-20-00615-CR with aggravated\n\nassault with a deadly weapon, a second-degree felony punishable by a term of\n\nimprisonment of not more than 20 years or less than two, and a fine not to exceed\n\n$10,000. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 12.33, 22.02(b). The indictment alleged that\n\nappellant intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly caused bodily injury and serious\n\nbodily injury to Monica Johnson by slashing and cutting her with a knife, and that\n\nappellant used and exhibited a deadly weapon, a knife, during the commission of the\n\nassault.\n\n      Appellant pleaded true to the allegations in the State\u2019s motion to proceed with\n\n                                         \u20137\u2013\n\fan adjudication of guilt. The State alleged appellant failed to report, as directed, to\n\nher community supervision officer in September, October, and November of 2019,\n\nor in any month thereafter; that she failed to pay her supervision fees, urinalysis fees,\n\nand a crime stoppers fee; and that she failed to complete her community service\n\nhours as directed. During the hearing on the State\u2019s motion, appellant admitted on\n\ncross-examination that she attacked her friend Monica Johnson with a knife after\n\nJohnson started dating her ex-boyfriend. As a result of this attack, Johnson suffered\n\nthree cuts to her face, two cuts on the back of her head, one cut on her arm, and one\n\ncut on her back. Appellant acknowledged that she had taken responsibility for her\n\nconduct in the case and had been placed on probation; and she said she was aware\n\nof the condition of her community supervision requiring her to report to her\n\nprobation officer. The record also shows that, on three prior occasions, the State had\n\nfiled motions to proceed with an adjudication of guilt\u2014based, in part, on appellant\n\nhaving failed to report to her community supervision officer as directed. These\n\nmotions were withdrawn after the trial court modified the terms of appellant\u2019s\n\ncommunity supervision. The court ultimately sentenced appellant to seven years,\n\nwell within the applicable range of punishment, and the court did not impose a fine.\n\n      The record in this case does not lead to an inference of gross disproportionality\n\nbecause the facts do not present a rare or extreme case. Further, based on the record\n\nand the nature of the offense, we cannot conclude appellant\u2019s sentence violated the\n\nobjectives of the penal code. We overrule appellant\u2019s second and third issues.\n\n                                          \u20138\u2013\n\f                                  3. Cross-Point\n\n      In a cross-point, the State argues the judgment in each case should be modified\n\nto omit the reference to a plea agreement in the portion of the judgment entitled\n\n\u201cTerms of Plea Bargain.\u201d As the State points out, the record shows appellant entered\n\na plea of true to the allegations in the State\u2019s motion without the benefit of a plea\n\nagreement.\n\n      When the record provides the necessary information to correct inaccuracies in\n\nthe trial court\u2019s judgment, we have the authority to reform the judgment to speak the\n\ntruth. TEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(b); Bigley v. State, 865 S.W.2d 26, 27\u201328 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1993); Asberry v. State, 813 S.W.2d 526, 529\u201330 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1991,\n\npet. ref\u2019d). Accordingly, we sustain the State\u2019s cross-point and modify the judgment\n\nin each case as follows: The portion of each judgment entitled \u201cTerms of Plea\n\nBargain\u201d is changed to \u201cN/A.\u201d\n\n      As modified, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments.\n\n\n\n                                           /Lana Myers//\n                                           LANA MYERS\n200614f.u05                                JUSTICE\n200615f.u05\nDo Not Publish\nTEX.
