DONALD R. MOBBLEY\n\n                       Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County\n                           No. 00-13852    Joseph B. Dailey, Judge\n\n\n\n                   No. W2002-00202-CCA-MR3-CD - Filed October 22, 2002\n\n\nA Shelby County Criminal Court jury convicted the defendant, Donald R. Mobbley, of burglary, a\nClass D felony, and the trial court sentenced him as a Range I, standard offender to two years in the\nworkhouse. The defendant appeals, claiming that the evidence is insufficient to support his\nconviction and that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on theft of property as a lesser\nincluded offense. We hold that the evidence is sufficient and that theft is not a lesser included\noffense of burglary. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n     Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nJOSEPH M. TIPTON, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which DAVID G. HAYES and JOE G.\nRILEY, JJ., joined.\n\nAC Wharton, Jr., District Public Defender; Tony N. Brayton, Assistant Public Defender (on appeal);\nand Mary Katherine Kent, Assistant Public Defender (at trial), for the appellant, Donald R. Mobbley.\n\nPaul G. Summers, Attorney General and Reporter; J. Ross Dyer, Assistant Attorney General;\nWilliam L. Gibbons, District Attorney General; and Stephen P.

Someone from the\nservice told him that the church\u2019s alarm had gone off and that the police had been dispatched to the\nscene. About ten minutes later, someone from the security service telephoned Reverend Jackson\nagain and told him that the police needed him at the church. When he arrived about twenty minutes\nlater, he unlocked the door, and the officers sent a police dog into the church. When the dog came\nout, Reverend Jackson went inside and turned on the lights. He noticed that a window had been\nbroken and that glass was on the floor. According to Reverend Jackson, the window was thirty-\n\fseven inches tall and eleven inches wide. Reverend Jackson looked around the church to see if\nanything was missing. Although there were other valuable items in the church, the only thing that\nhad been taken was a white oscillating fan that sat on a desk in the pastor\u2019s study.\n\n        Reverend Jackson told the officers that the fan was missing. About five minutes later, the\nofficers went outside and got the fan out of a patrol car. A man was sitting in the back of the car.\nReverend Jackson testified that he did not know the defendant and that the defendant did not have\npermission to be in the church.\n\n        Officer Michael S. Huff of the Memphis Police Department testified that about 3:15 a.m. on\nOctober 16, he was dispatched to the Mars Hill Missionary Baptist Church. When he received the\ndispatch, he was about one and one-half miles from the church. As Officer Huff drove west on\nShelby Drive, he passed a thin African-American male walking east and carrying a white fan.\nAlthough Officer Huff thought it was unusual for someone to be walking on the street at that time\nof day, he did not stop the man because he wanted to get to the church. When he arrived at the crime\nscene, he saw that a window had been broken out. Officer Huff secured the church and called\nOfficer Mervin Jones on the police radio. He told Officer Jones that an African-American male was\ncarrying a white fan and walking east on Shelby Drive and that Officer Jones needed to find and\ndetain the man. Officer Jones arrested the defendant and brought him to the church.\n\n       Officer Huff testified that when Reverend Jackson arrived at the church, they went inside.\nReverend Jackson looked around for a few minutes and told the officers that a white fan was\nmissing. The officers went to the patrol car and got the fan that the defendant had been carrying.\nReverend Jackson identified the fan as the one that had been taken from the church office. In Officer\nHuff\u2019s opinion, the defendant could have fit through the broken church window.\n\n       On cross-examination, Officer Huff testified that he was driving about sixty miles per hour\nwhen he passed the man on Shelby Drive. The church was on the north side of Shelby Drive, and\nthe man was walking on the north side of the street. Officer Huff saw the man near a streetlight.\nOfficer Huff did not see any distinguishing marks, such as a name, on the fan.\n\n        Officer Mervin Jones of the Memphis Police Department testified that about 3:00 a.m. on\nOctober 16, he was dispatched to the Mars Hill Missionary Baptist Church. As he was driving west\ntoward the church, he passed the defendant, who was walking east and carrying a white fan. As\nOfficer Jones approached the church, Officer Huff radioed and told him that a man was walking\ndown the street carrying a fan. Officer Jones went back to find the defendant. However, the\ndefendant was no longer walking on Shelby Drive. Officer Jones turned onto Ford Street and saw\nthe defendant. He stopped the defendant, put the defendant into the back of his patrol car, and drove\nto the church.\n\n      According to Officer Jones, when he arrived at the church, he left the defendant in the car\nand went into the church with Officer Huff and Reverend Jackson. Officer Jones did not tell\nReverend Jackson that he had arrested the defendant. Reverend Jackson looked around the church\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fand told the officers that a white fan was missing. Officer Jones and Reverend Jackson went out to\nthe patrol car and Officer Jones showed him the fan. Reverend Jackson identified the fan as the one\nthat was missing from the church. Officer Jones thought he remembered identifying marks, such as\nsomeone\u2019s initials, being on the fan. He believed that the defendant could have fit through the\nchurch window.\n\n       On cross-examination, Officer Jones testified that when he first saw the defendant, the\ndefendant was about thirty yards from the church. The defendant was not running and did not run\nwhen Officer Jones stopped him on Ford Street. The defendant was cooperative when Officer Jones\nput him in the patrol car.\n\n        Officer Alvin Peppers, a crime scene technician for the Memphis Police Department, testified\nthat on October 16, he was dispatched to the Mars Hill Missionary Baptist Church. When he arrived,\nhe saw that a window on the east side of the church had been broken out. Officer Peppers did not\ncollect any evidence and was unable to lift any fingerprints from the crime scene. He did not recall\nseeing any blood or torn clothing near the window or any objects that could have been used to break\nit. The defendant did not put on any proof, and the jury found him guilty of burglary.\n\n        First, the defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction.\nSpecifically, he claims that the state presented no evidence that he had been inside the church. The\nstate claims that the evidence is sufficient. We agree with the state.\n\n        Our standard of review when the defendant questions the sufficiency of the evidence on\nappeal is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\u201d Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2789 (1979). We do not reweigh\nthe evidence but presume that the jury has resolved all conflicts in the testimony and drawn all\nreasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the state. See State v. Sheffield, 676 S.W.2d\n542, 547 (Tenn. 1984); State v. Cabbage, 571 S.W.2d 832, 835 (Tenn. 1978). Questions about\nwitness credibility were resolved by the jury. See State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d 651, 659 (Tenn. 1997).\n\n       Circumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to support a conviction. State v. Richmond,\n7 S.W.3d 90, 91 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999); State v. Buttrey, 756 S.W.2d 718, 721 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1988).\n\n               The law is firmly established in this State that to warrant a criminal\n               conviction upon circumstantial evidence alone, the evidence must be\n               not only consistent with the guilt of the accused but it must also be\n               inconsistent with his innocence and must exclude every other\n               reasonable theory or hypothesis except that of guilt, and it must\n               establish such a certainty of guilt of the accused as to convince the\n               mind beyond a reasonable doubt that he is the one who committed the\n               crime.\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fPruitt v. State, 3 Tenn. Crim. App. 256, 267, 460 S.W.2d 385, 390 (1970). While following these\nguidelines, we must note that the jury decides the weight to be given to circumstantial evidence and\nthat the \u201c\u2018inferences to be drawn from such evidence, and the extent to which the circumstances are\nconsistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence, are questions primarily for the jury.\u2019\u201d Marable\nv. State, 203 Tenn. 440, 452, 313 S.W.2d 451, 457 (1958) (quoting 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence\n1611).\n\n       As charged in the indictment, a burglary is committed when a person enters a building\nwithout the consent of the owner with the intent to commit a theft. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\n39-14-402(a)(1). A person commits theft \u201cif, with the intent to deprive the owner of property, the\nperson knowingly obtains or exercises control over the property without the owner\u2019s effective\nconsent.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-103.\n\n        Viewed in the light most favorable to the state, the evidence shows that the defendant\nburglarized the Mars Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Officer Jones testified that he was dispatched\nto the scene of a break-in at the church about 3:00 a.m. on August 16. As he was driving toward the\nchurch, he passed the defendant, who was about thirty yards from the church and carrying a white\nfan. Officer Jones later arrested the defendant and took him to the church. When Reverend Jackson\ntold Officer Jones that a white fan was missing from the church office, Officer Jones showed\nReverend Jackson the fan that the defendant had been carrying. Reverend Jackson identified the fan\nas the one that had been taken. Although there was no direct evidence that the defendant entered the\nchurch, we believe that a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\nbroke the church window and entered the church with the intent to take the church\u2019s property. The\nevidence is sufficient to support the conviction.\n\n        The defendant also claims that theft is a lesser included offense of burglary under part (a) of\nthe test set out in State v. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453, 466-67 (Tenn. 1999), and that the trial court\ncommitted plain error by failing to instruct the jury on that offense. The state contends that while\ntheft may be a lesser included offense of burglary, the trial court did not err because it instructed the\njury on theft. Moreover, the state claims that even if the trial court erred by failing to instruct the\njury specifically on the misdemeanor offense of theft of property less than five hundred dollars, the\nerror was harmless under State v. Williams, 977 S.W.2d 101 (Tenn. 1998), because the jury chose\nto convict the defendant of the greater offense of burglary. We conclude that the defendant is not\nentitled to relief because theft is not a lesser included offense of burglary.\n\n        In criminal cases, the trial court has the duty to charge the jury on all of the law that applies\nto the facts of the case. See State v. Harris, 839 S.W.2d 54, 73 (Tenn. 1992). Anything short of a\ncomplete charge denies the defendant his constitutional right to a trial by jury. See State v. McAfee,\n737 S.W.2d 304, 308 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987). Our supreme court has held that an offense is a\nlesser included offense if:\n\n                (a) all of its statutory elements are included within the statutory\n                elements of the offense charged; or\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f                (b) it fails to meet the definition in part (a) only in the respect that it\n                contains a statutory element or elements establishing\n\n                        (1) a different mental state indicating a lesser kind of\n                        culpability; and/or\n\n                        (2) a less serious harm or risk of harm to the same\n                        person, property or public interest; or\n\n                (c) it consists of\n\n                        (1) facilitation of the offense charged or of an offense\n                        that otherwise meets the definition of lesser-included\n                        offense in part (a) or (b); or\n\n                        (2) an attempt to commit the offense charged or an\n                        offense that otherwise meets the definition of\n                        lesser-included offense in part (a) or (b); or\n\n                        (3) solicitation to commit the offense charged or an\n                        offense that otherwise meets the definition of\n                        lesser-included offense in part (a) or (b).\n\nBurns, 6 S.W.3d at 466-67. If an offense is a lesser included offense, then the trial court must\nconduct the following two-step analysis in order to determine whether the lesser included offense\ninstruction should be given:\n\n                First, the trial court must determine whether any evidence exists that\n                reasonable minds could accept as to the lesser-included offense. In\n                making this determination, the trial court must view the evidence\n                liberally in the light most favorable to the existence of the\n                lesser-included offense without making any judgments on the\n                credibility of such evidence. Second, the trial court must determine\n                if the evidence, viewed in this light, is legally sufficient to support a\n                conviction for the lesser-included offense.\n\nId. at 469. \u201cAs a general rule, evidence sufficient to warrant an instruction on the greater offense\nalso will support an instruction on a lesser offense under part (a) of the Burns test.\u201d State v. Allen,\n69 S.W.3d 181, 188 (Tenn. 2002).\n\n        Initially, we note that although the defendant failed to include the transcript of the jury charge\nwith the record on appeal, the trial court\u2019s written instructions are part of the record. As the state\npoints out in its brief, the instructions show that the trial court instructed the jury on theft. However,\n\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fwe believe that the instructions reflect that the trial court instructed the jury on theft as it relates to\nthe intent to commit the theft element of burglary, not as a lesser included offense of burglary.\nTherefore, the state\u2019s contention that the trial court instructed the jury as to the lesser included\noffense of theft is incorrect.\n\n        In any event, our supreme court has held that theft is not a lesser included offense of burglary.\nSee State v. Davis, 613 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tenn. 1981); see also State v. Roberts, 943 S.W.2d 403,\n407 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996), overruled on other grounds by State v. Ralph, 6 S.W.3d 251 (Tenn.\n1999). Although these cases were decided before Burns, we glean nothing from the Burns test that\nwould cause us to determine that theft is a lesser included offense of burglary. We conclude that\nthe defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on theft and, therefore, that the trial court did not\ncommit plain error by failing to instruct the jury on that offense. See T.R.A.P. 52(b).\n\n        Based upon the foregoing and the record as a whole, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                         ___________________________________\n                                                         JOSEPH M.
