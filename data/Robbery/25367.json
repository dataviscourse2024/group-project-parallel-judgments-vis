Concluding that Patrick\n\nfailed to comply with the statutory requirements for a change of name, see TEX.\n\nFAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 45.102 (West 2014), we hold that the trial court did not abuse\n\fits discretion in denying Patrick\u2019s petition and motion for new trial. Therefore, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                      Background\n\n      In January 2015, Patrick Kent Lindsay Jones, appearing pro se, filed a\n\nverified form petition for a change of name in the trial court. In the petition,\n\nPatrick asked that the trial court change his name from \u201cPatrick Kent Lindsay\n\nJones\u201d to \u201cPatrick Joseph LeBaron.\u201d Patrick represented that he wanted to change\n\nhis name to prevent alleged identity theft and harassment from his father, Allen\n\nKent Jones. Patrick further represented that he had never been convicted of a\n\nfelony that had not been pardoned, had never been charged with an offense above a\n\nClass C misdemeanor, and was not required to register as a sex offender.\n\n      In April 2015, Patrick filed an unverified proposed form order granting him\n\na change of name. In the proposed order, Patrick changed his name to \u201cPatrick\n\nCharles Duval\u201d instead of \u201cPatrick Joseph LeBaron\u201d and disclosed a charge for\n\nreckless driving, a Class B misdemeanor.1\n\n      After Patrick filed his proposed order, the trial court signed and entered a\n\ndifferent order denying Patrick\u2019s petition. In the order, the trial court found that\n\nPatrick had \u201cmisrepresented his criminal history in his sworn to and subscribed\n\noriginal petition for name change.\u201d\n\n\n1\n      See TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. \u00a7 545.401 (West. 2011).\n                                          2\n\f      In May 2015, Patrick filed a motion for new trial. He attached a sworn\n\naffidavit to the motion as evidence \u201cthat he did not intentionally misrepresent his\n\ncriminal history\u201d in his petition.     In his affidavit, Patrick stated that he was\n\nunaware that reckless driving was a Class B misdemeanor when he prepared his\n\npetition, and, as a result, inadvertently failed to disclose the charge in his petition.\n\nPatrick argued that his affidavit proved that he did not intentionally misrepresent\n\nhis criminal history and therefore did not waive his right to a name change. He\n\nrequested that the trial court set aside its order and grant a new trial on his petition\n\nfor a change of name. The trial court denied Patrick\u2019s motion for new trial.\n\n      Patrick appealed.\n\n                                      Discussion\n\n      In seven points of error, Patrick argues that the trial court erred in denying\n\nhis petition for a change of name.\n\n      Whether a petition for a change of name is granted is a matter of judicial\n\ndiscretion. In re Mayol, 137 S.W.3d 103, 105 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2004, no pet.). The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted\n\nwithout reference to any guiding rules and principles\u2014i.e., whether the trial court\n\nacted arbitrarily or unreasonably. Id. The mere fact that a trial court may decide a\n\nmatter within its discretionary authority in a manner different from an appellate\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fjudge in a similar circumstance does not demonstrate that an abuse of discretion\n\nhas occurred. Id.\n\n      The guiding rules and principles for determining whether to grant or to deny\n\na petition requesting a change of name are found in Texas Family Code, chapter\n\n45. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 45.101\u201345.107 (West 2014). Section 45.101 grants\n\nan adult the right to \u201cfile a petition requesting a change of name in the county of\n\nthe adult\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Id. \u00a7 45.101.\n\n      Section 45.102 sets forth the requirements of such a petition. Id. \u00a7 45.102.\n\nSubsection (a) requires the petition to be verified and to include: (1) the present\n\nname and place of residence of the petitioner; (2) the full name requested for the\n\npetitioner; (3) the reason the change in name is requested; (4) whether the\n\npetitioner has been the subject of a final felony conviction; (5) whether the\n\npetitioner is subject to the registration requirements of sex offenders; and (6) a\n\nlegible and complete set of the petitioner\u2019s fingerprints on a fingerprint card format\n\nacceptable to the Department of Public Safety and the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation. Id. \u00a7 45.102(a).\n\n      Subsection (b) lists additional information that the petition must include or\n\nprovide a reasonable explanation for not including. Id. \u00a7 45.102(b). Included\n\namong such information is \u201cany offense above the grade of Class C misdemeanor\n\nfor which the petitioner has been charged[.]\u201d Id. \u00a7 45.102(b)(2).\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      Section 45.103 sets forth the circumstances under which a trial court must\n\norder a change of name:\n\n      The court shall order a change of name under this subchapter for a\n      person other than a person with a final felony conviction or a person\n      subject to the registration requirements of Chapter 62, Code of\n      Criminal Procedure, if the change is in the interest or to the benefit of\n      the petitioner and in the interest of the public.\n\nId. \u00a7 45.103(a).\n\n      Here, based on the evidence presented, we conclude that the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Patrick\u2019s name change request. The evidence\n\nshows that Patrick did not disclose his reckless driving charge in his verified\n\npetition. Instead, he disclosed the charge in his unverified proposed order.2\n\nSection 45.102 requires that mandatory disclosures relating to the petitioner\u2019s\n\ncriminal history, such as the disclosure of Patrick\u2019s reckless driving charge, be\n\nmade in a verified petition. Id. \u00a7 45.102. By disclosing his reckless driving charge\n\nin his unverified proposed order, Patrick failed to comply with the statutory\n\nrequirements for a change of name.\n\n\n\n2\n      In his brief, Patrick alleges that, at a hearing on his petition, the trial court\n      permitted him to disclose his reckless driving charge in his unverified proposed\n      order instead of his verified petition. However, the record does not include a\n      transcript of the hearing or any other evidence supporting Patrick\u2019s allegation. See\n      Unifund CCR Partners v. Weaver, 262 S.W.3d 796, 797 (Tex. 2008) (appellate\n      courts \u201cdo not consider factual assertions that appear solely in briefs and are not\n      supported by the record\u201d); TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(g), (i).\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      Further, there is no evidence that the reckless driving charge was the only\n\nrelevant part of Patrick\u2019s criminal history that he failed to disclose in his verified\n\npetition. Id. \u00a7 45.102(a)(4)\u2013(5), (b)(2)\u2013(3). There is no evidence that Patrick\u2019s\n\nverified petition included a set of fingerprints. Id. \u00a7 45.102(a)(6). And there was a\n\ndiscrepancy between the change of the name requested in Patrick\u2019s petition and the\n\nchange of name in his proposed order.3 Id. \u00a7 45.102(a)(2).\n\n      Thus, Patrick has failed to show that he complied with the statutory\n\nrequirements for a change of name. Rather, the record shows the opposite\u2014that\n\nPatrick did not make all the mandatory disclosures in and include all the necessary\n\ninformation with his verified petition. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Patrick\u2019s petition for a change of name and\n\nmotion for new trial.4\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Patrick\u2019s petition asks that his name be changed to \u201cPatrick Joseph LeBaron\u201d\n      whereas his proposed order changes his name to \u201cPatrick Charles Duval.\u201d\n4\n      We note that nothing on the face of Family Code, chapter 45, prevents Patrick\n      from refiling a petition that satisfies the requirements set forth in section 45.102.\n\n                                            6\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the trial court\u2019s orders.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Evelyn V.
