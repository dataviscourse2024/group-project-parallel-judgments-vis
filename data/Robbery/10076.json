No. 94-20013-01)\n\n\nKim Martin Fowler, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Office of the United States Attorney,\nKansas City, Kansas, for Plaintiff - Appellee.\n\nMichael Lewis Harris, Office of the Federal Public Defender, Kansas City, Kansas, for\nDefendant - Appellant.\n\n\nBefore EBEL, Circuit Judge, WHITE,* Associate Justice (Ret.), and KELLY, Circuit\nJudge.\n\n\nKELLY, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n       *\n           The Honorable Byron R. White, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court,\n(Ret.), sitting by designation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 294(a).\n\f       Defendant William Henry Myers appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress evidence. Defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to possession with\n\nintent to distribute more than 100 but less than 1,000 marijuana plants, 21 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 841(a)(1). See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2). He also appeals the court\u2019s imposition of the\n\nminimum mandatory sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Our jurisdiction arises\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                       Background\n\n       In October 1993, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) received information\n\nfrom the Riley County Police Department that Mr. Myers was maintaining an indoor\n\nmarijuana growing operation. The county police had received the information from the\n\nsubjects of two separate investigations. One of them provided Mr. Myers\u2019s home address\n\nand phone number.\n\n       KBI agents confirmed that Mr. Myers lived at the address provided by the\n\ninformant. They further observed that Mr. Myers\u2019s attic windows were covered with a\n\nblack opaque material, and that the snow from a recent snowfall had melted from Mr.\n\nMyers\u2019s roof, while the snow remained on the roofs of surrounding residences. A check\n\nof Mr. Myers\u2019s utility accounts revealed that Mr. Myers\u2019s electricity and water usage was\n\nunusually high between December 1993 and February 1994, both in comparison to the\n\nprevious year\u2019s amounts at the same residence, and to a nearby house of comparable size.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fFor example, Mr. Myers used 2,340 kilowatt hours and 25,500 gallons of water in January\n\n1994--more than double the amount of electricity and five times the amount of water used\n\nby the house next door during that month. The KBI\u2019s investigation also revealed that Mr.\n\nMyers had used unissued social security numbers for his telephone and utility accounts.\n\nFinally, KBI agents discovered that Mr. Myers had prior convictions for burglary and\n\ntheft, and cocaine trafficking. They also discovered that, as a juvenile, Mr. Myers had\n\nbeen involved in the fire bombing of a jail or police vehicle and had been convicted of\n\npossession of an unregistered firearm and possession of a fire bomb.\n\n       On the basis of this information, the KBI obtained a warrant to search Mr. Myers\u2019s\n\nresidence. The KBI also received permission to conduct a night-time search, reasoning\n\nthat it would enhance officer safety because the house was surrounded by a substantial\n\nopen area. The KBI agents also noted that safety was a concern because of Mr. Myers\u2019s\n\ncriminal history, and because manufacturers and distributors of narcotics often maintain\n\nfirearms to protect themselves and their operations.\n\n       On March 9, 1994, at approximately 6:09 a.m., agents of the KBI, dressed\n\ncompletely in black and wielding automatic machine guns, knocked on Mr. Myers\u2019s front\n\ndoor and announced that they had a search warrant. The agents waited ten seconds, then\n\nbattered down the door and rolled a Deftec Model 25 Distraction Device, also known as a\n\n\u201cflash-bang,\u201d into the living room. The device exploded, and the agents then stormed the\n\nhouse, finding Mr. Myers, his wife, nineteen-year-old stepson, nine-year-old\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fstepdaughter, and seventeen-month-old daughter.\n\n       After subduing Mr. Myers and his wife and children, the KBI conducted a search\n\nof the house, which revealed a substantial marijuana growing operation in the attic.\n\n       The district court sentenced Mr. Myers to the statutory minimum 60 months, 21\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), holding that it was within its discretion not to apply the \u201csafety\n\nvalve\u201d provision contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), which allows a departure from the\n\nstatutory minimum if the defendant meets certain criteria.\n\n\n\n                                         Discussion\n\n                              A. Fourth Amendment Claims\n\n       We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error; however, the\n\nreasonableness of a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment is a question of law\n\nwhich we review de novo. United States v. Hernandez, 93 F.3d 1493, 1498 (10th Cir.\n\n1996). \u201cTo assess the validity of a search warrant under the Fourth Amendment, we\n\nreview whether the totality of the circumstances in the affidavit provided . . . a\n\nsubstantial basis for finding a fair probability that contraband or other evidence of a crime\n\nwould be found at the searched premises.\u201d United States v. McCarty, 82 F.3d 943, 947\n\n(10th Cir.) (quotations omitted), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 257 (1996).\n\n       Mr. Myers first claims that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause\n\nbecause the informants did not provide the basis for their knowledge, and the independent\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fpolice investigation was insufficient to corroborate the informants\u2019 tips. We disagree. In\n\nUnited States v. Corral, 970 F.2d 719 (10th Cir. 1992), we held that an informant\u2019s tip\n\nwas sufficiently corroborated by a police investigation which showed that the defendant\n\nhad previously been arrested for drug trafficking, and that the defendant had had an\n\nunusually high volume of visitors briefly entering and leaving her residence, consistent\n\nwith drug trafficking. Id. at 727.\n\n       Similarly, here the police uncovered enough evidence to corroborate the\n\ninformants\u2019 statements. Among other things, Mr. Myers\u2019s residence was consuming\n\nunusually high amounts of electricity and water, and, as in Corral, Mr. Myers had a\n\ncriminal record showing a history of drug involvement. The investigation sufficiently\n\ncorroborated the informants\u2019 statements, and thus the totality of the circumstances in the\n\naffidavit provided a substantial basis for finding a fair probability that an illegal growing\n\noperation would be found at Mr. Myers\u2019s residence.\n\n       Mr. Myers also argues that the information provided to the police was \u201cstale,\u201d\n\nbecause there was a five-month gap between when the police received the tips and when\n\nthe search warrant was obtained. However, the determination of whether information is\n\nstale depends on the nature of the crime and the length of criminal activity, not simply the\n\nnumber of days that have elapsed between the facts relied upon and the issuance of the\n\nwarrant. United States v. Snow, 919 F.2d 1458, 1460 (10th Cir. 1990). We agree with\n\nthe district court that Mr. Myers\u2019s drug activities were \u201congoing and continuous,\u201d so that\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fthe passage of time did not render the information stale.\n\n       Finally, Mr. Myers attacks the validity of the warrant, claiming that KBI agents\n\nmanufactured the information in the warrant concerning one informant\u2019s tip, and that the\n\naffidavit failed to reveal that the informants were under arrest at the time they made\n\nstatements to the police. We need not decide these issues, however, because the\n\ninformation gathered by the KBI is sufficient to establish probable cause even without the\n\nchallenged tip. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 156 (1978) (even if a court finds that\n\nsome information is false, suppression is required only if the false or misleading\n\ninformation is necessary to a finding of probable cause); United States v. Knapp, 1 F.3d\n\n1026, 1029 (10th Cir. 1993) (a knowing or reckless omission from a warrant application\n\nviolates the Fourth Amendment only if the omitted material would vitiate probable\n\ncause).\n\n       Mr. Myers next claims that the KBI\u2019s method of executing the search warrant\n\nviolated his Fourth Amendment right against an unreasonable search. He argues that the\n\nKBI failed to comply with the knock and announce requirement in violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment. See Wilson v. Arkansas, 115 S. Ct. 1914, 1918 (1995). However, the\n\nagents who conducted the search testified that they knocked loudly on Mr. Myers\u2019s front\n\ndoor, and waited ten seconds before battering it down. Thus, the district court\u2019s\n\nconclusion that the police knocked and announced is supported by evidence and is not\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f       Mr. Myers also challenges the agents\u2019 use of what he calls a \u201cmilitary-style\n\nassault.\u201d Pursuant to the warrant, the agents, dressed in black uniforms, conducted the\n\nsearch of Mr. Myers\u2019s residence in the early morning hours. The agents battered down\n\nthe door and rolled a distraction device into the house, which exploded with a brilliant\n\nflash of light and a loud bang, the purpose of which is to distract and disorient any\n\noccupants in the vicinity of the entry.\n\n       In reviewing Mr. Myers\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, we must determine whether\n\nthe agents\u2019 actions were \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d in light of the facts and circumstances\n\nconfronting them. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989). The use of a \u201cflash-\n\nbang\u201d device in a house where innocent and unsuspecting children sleep gives us great\n\npause. Certainly, we could not countenance the use of such a device as a routine matter.\n\nSee Jenkins v. Wood, 81 F.3d 988, 996-98 (10th Cir. 1996) (Henry, J., concurring)\n\n(questioning the policies of the KBI in using \u201cflash-bangs\u201d and no-knock entries in the\n\nexecution of a warrant). However, we also recognize that we must review the agents\u2019\n\nactions from the perspective of reasonable agents on the scene, Graham, 490 U.S. at 396,\n\nwho are legitimately concerned with not only doing their job but with their own safety.\n\nAlthough it might seem that the KBI\u2019s actions in this case come dangerously close to a\n\nFourth Amendment violation, we cannot say that their actions were objectively\n\nunreasonable given the district court\u2019s factual findings. The district court found that the\n\nagents knew that Mr. Myers had a history of illegal drug trafficking, and had spent time in\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\ffederal prison for a fire bombing incident, although they were unsuccessful in learning of\n\nthe details of the incident. The district court obviously credited police testimony that Mr.\n\nMyers\u2019s lengthy pattern of criminal activity--beginning with the fire bombing in 1971 and\n\ncontinuing until the cocaine conviction in 19881--made them apprehensive. The district\n\ncourt also found that the agents knew that there was a fair probability that Mr. Myers\u2019s\n\nresidence contained an illegal marijuana growing operation.\n\n\n\n                                         B. Sentencing\n\n       Mr. Myers claims that the district court erred by imposing the statutory minimum\n\nof 60 months, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), rather than imposing a lesser sentence\n\npursuant to the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).2 Section\n\n\n       1\n          The police also had information that in 1988, Mr. Myers had told law enforcement\nagents that he had been involved with drugs for fifteen years.\n       2\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of an offense under [21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 841], the court shall impose a sentence pursuant to [the United States Sentencing Guidelines,\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994] without regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds at\nsentencing . . . that--\n\n               (1) the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined\n        under the sentencing guidelines;\n               (2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a\n       firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection\n       with the offense;\n               (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;\n               (4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others\n       in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a\n       continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 848; and\n               (5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully\n       provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning\n\n                                               -8-\n\f3553(f) provides that the district court shall impose a sentence pursuant to the sentencing\n\nguidelines, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, without regard to the statutory minimum, if the\n\ndefendant meets five criteria. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a\n\nstatute or the sentencing guidelines. United States v. Acosta-Olivas, 71 F.3d 375, 377\n\n(10th Cir. 1995).\n\n       The district court held that whether the safety valve provision should apply is a\n\nmatter within its discretion, and declined to even address whether the defendant met the\n\nfive criteria listed in \u00a7 3553(f). That holding is at odds with the plain language of the\n\nstatute, which directs the court to disregard the statutory minimum if the defendant meets\n\nthe five criteria: \u201c[T]he court shall impose a sentence . . . without regard to any statutory\n\nminimum sentence . . . .\u201d It is a basic canon of statutory construction that use of the word\n\n\u201cshall\u201d indicates a mandatory intent. Norman J. Singer, 1A Sutherland Statutory\n\nConstruction \u00a7 25.04 (5th ed. 1992); see also Association of Civilian Technicians v.\n\nFederal Labor Relations Auth., 22 F.3d 1150, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (noting that the word\n\n\u201cshall\u201d in a statute \u201cgenerally indicates a command that admits of no discretion on the\n\npart of the person instructed to carry out the directive\u201d).\n\n\n\n       the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common\n       scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information\n       to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a\n       determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f       Regardless, we may affirm the judgment for reasons other than those relied upon\n\nby the district court, provided they are supported by the record. Medina v. City and\n\nCounty of Denver, 960 F.2d 1493, 1495 n.1 (10th Cir. 1992). The record is clear that Mr.\n\nMyers has not met section 5 of the safety valve provision, which required him to disclose\n\n\u201call information and evidence . . . concerning the offense . . . that [was] part of the same\n\ncourse of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d Section 5 is very broad, requiring\n\ndisclosure of everything the defendant knows about his own actions and those who\n\nparticipated in the crime with him. See Acosta-Olivas, 71 F.3d at 378-79 (noting that\n\nsection 5 has been termed the \u201ctell all that you can tell\u201d requirement). In this case, Mr.\n\nMyers related to the KBI all that he knew about his own actions, but refused to provide\n\nother information, such as who his buyers were or the names of others connected to his\n\noperation. Mr. Myers did not provide additional information apparently because he did\n\nnot think it would be helpful to the government. However, section 5 requires disclosure\n\n\u201cwhether or not it is relevant or useful to the government\u2019s investigation.\u201d United States\n\nv. Shrestha, 86 F.3d 935, 939 (9th Cir. 1996); see also Acosta-Olivas, 71 F.3d at 379.\n\nThe burden was on Mr. Myers to prove that he met the five criteria contained in\n\n\u00a7 3553(f). United States v. Verners, 1996 WL 742388, at *1 (10th Cir. Dec. 31, 1996).\n\nHe failed to carry that burden.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\f",
