Generally, petitioner challenges the jurisdiction of the\n\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia, see id., and he deems it \u201cnecessary to advance a\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The docket reflects that petitioner, whose pleading is titled \u201cPetition for Habeas Corpus and\nNotice of Removal,\u201d has paid a filing fee of $5.00. The Court treats the pleading as a habeas\npetition alone, and dismisses petitioner\u2019s tort claims without prejudice. If petitioner wishes to\npursue his tort claims, he may file a separate civil action and pay the appropriate filing fee (or\nfile an application to proceed in forma pauperis). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1914, 1915(a). Removal of\nthe criminal case is not warranted, and at any rate, the notice of removal is not timely filed.\n                                                   1\n\fpetition [for a writ of habeas corpus] in order to bar the local court from compelling [him] to\n\nsubmit physically to the local court,\u201d id. \u00b6 7.\n\n\n        Although petitioner may seek habeas relief in district court on the ground that \u201c[h]e is in\n\ncustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n2241(c)(3), \u201ca federal court may dismiss an action when there is a direct conflict between the\n\nexercise of federal and state jurisdiction and considerations of comity and federalism dictate that\n\nthe federal court should defer to the state proceedings.\u201d Hoai v. Sun Refining and Marketing\n\nCo., Inc., 866 F.2d 1515, 1517 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (citing Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43-45\n\n(1971); Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1987)). 2 This is such an action.\n\n\n       Petitioner\u2019s criminal case appears to be in its early stages, and nothing prevents petitioner\n\nfrom raising his challenge to the Superior Court\u2019s jurisdiction in the course of the criminal\n\nproceedings in the District of Columbia courts. See JMM Corp. v. District of Columbia, 378\n\nF.3d 1117, 1127 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting litigant\u2019s opportunity to raise constitutional claims as\n\ndefenses in Superior Court proceeding). \u201cFurthermore, it is well settled doctrine that federal\n\ncourts should not enjoin or otherwise interfere with ongoing proceedings in the Superior Court.\u201d\n\nSmith v. Holder, No. 14-131, 2014 WL 414292, at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 30, 2014) (citations omitted),\n\naff\u2019d, 561 F. App\u2019x 12 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see In re Justices of Super. Ct. Dep\u2019t of Mass. Trial Ct.,\n\n218 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating that \u201cfederal habeas relief, as a general rule, is not\n\navailable to defendants seeking pretrial review of constitutional challenges to state criminal\n\n\n2\n   For purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, the Court presumes without deciding that\npetitioner is \u201cin custody.\u201d\n                                             2\n\fproceedings\u201d); Bolton v. Allen, No. 12-1272, 2012 WL 2012 WL 5818246, at *1 (D.D.C. Nov.\n\n13, 2012) (dismissing pretrial detainee\u2019s civil rights complaint against Superior Court judge and\n\nothers participating in criminal prosecution under Younger abstention doctrine).    This Court,\n\ntherefore, neither can dismiss the criminal charges pending against petitioner nor will prevent the\n\nSuperior Court from proceeding in the criminal case against petitioner. His petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus will be denied, and this civil action will be dismissed. An Order is issued\n\nseparately.\n\n\n\n\nDATE: December 11, 2014                      /s/\n                                             RUDOLPH CONTRERAS\n                                             United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f",
