Carmen Franklin and Jenifer Chism\nparked their cars in a Chicago-area lot owned by Metra, the\npublic commuter railroad, and operated by CPS Chicago\nParking, LLC. (\u201cCPS\u201d). The lot offers parking spaces to the\n\f2                                                          No. 14-3774\n\npublic at the rate of $1.50 per day. CPS says the two failed to\npay and sent them violation notices demanding payment of\nthe $1.50 fee and a $45 nonpayment penalty. When they still\ndid not pay, CPS referred the matter for collection to Parking\nRevenue Recovery Services, Inc. (\u201cParking Revenue\u201d), which\nsent them collection letters for the $46.50 total due.\n    Franklin and Chism responded with this class action\nagainst Parking Revenue alleging violations of the Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692 et seq.\nThe district court entered summary judgment for Parking\nRevenue, holding that the FDCPA does not apply because\nthe unpaid parking obligations are not \u201cdebts\u201d as that term\nis defined in \u00a7 1692a(5).\n   We reverse. The obligations at issue here\u2014unpaid park-\ning fees and nonpayment penalties\u2014are \u201cdebts\u201d within the\nmeaning of the FDCPA. That statutory term comprises\nobligations \u201carising out of\u201d consumer \u201ctransactions.\u201d Park-\ning in a lot that is open to all customers subject to stated\ncharges is a \u201ctransaction.\u201d The obligation that arises from\nthat transaction is a \u201cdebt,\u201d and an attempt to collect it must\ncomply with the FDCPA. 1\n\n\n1 We solicited the views of the Federal Trade Commission on this issue.\nThe FTC has an interest in protecting consumers from abusive debt-\ncollection practices. The FTC accepted our invitation and filed a brief as\namicus curiae joined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,\nwhich shares the FTC\u2019s interest in protecting consumers and is author-\nized to enforce the FDCPA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692l(b)(6). In the view of these\nfederal agencies charged with enforcing the statute, the obligations at\nissue here are indeed debts covered by the FDCPA. The agencies take no\nposition on the ultimate merits. We appreciate their willingness to assist\nthe court.\n\fNo. 14-3774                                                  3\n\n                       I. Background\n    In June 2012 Franklin and Chism parked their cars in a\nChicago-area lot owned by Metra (the Commuter Rail\nDivision of the Regional Transportation Authority) and\noperated by CPS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Central\nParking System, Inc. CPS is a private company that contracts\nwith Metra to manage parking lots adjacent to commuter rail\nstations throughout the Chicago area. Under its contract\nwith Metra, CPS keeps a percentage of the gross revenues\ncollected from the lots that it operates. The signage and the\npay machine at the lot plainly state that it costs $1.50 for\ndaily parking. And CPS tells us that the signage also states\nthat a fee of up to $60 will be assessed to parkers who fail to\npay.\n    Franklin and Chism both insist that they paid the $1.50\nupon parking, but CPS claims they parked without paying\nand now owe the $1.50 parking fee and a $45 nonpayment\npenalty. CPS referred the matter to Parking Revenue, which\nin turn sent the women collection letters. The letters noted\nthat Franklin and Chism had previously received one or\nmore parking-violation notices and demanded payment of\n\u201cthis debt\u201d within 30 days or alternatively, notification in\nwriting that they dispute the debt\u2019s validity.\n    Franklin and Chism responded with this class action\nagainst Parking Revenue alleging that the collection letters\nviolated the FDCPA in numerous ways. The suit alleges that\nparking in the lot was a \u201ctransaction\u201d\u2014Central Parking\noffers parking to all comers, which the plaintiffs accepted by\nparking in the lot\u2014and the payment obligation therefore\nwas a debt, the collection of which is governed by FDCPA.\n\f4                                                           No. 14-3774\n\n    The district judge disagreed. He characterized the collec-\ntion letters as attempts to collect fines imposed for violating\nthe parking lot\u2019s rules. The judge said that the payment\nobligation was \u201cmaterially indistinguishable from a ticket\nissued for failure to feed a parking meter.\u201d As such, it did\nnot reflect a consensual transaction; Franklin and Chism\nessentially stole the parking spaces from CPS. On this reason-\ning, the judge concluded that the obligations were not debts\nwithin the meaning of the FDCPA and granted Parking\nRevenue\u2019s motion for summary judgment. 2\n                            II. Discussion\n   We review the court\u2019s order granting summary judgment\nde novo, evaluating the record in the light most favorable to\nFranklin and Chism and drawing all reasonable inferences\nfrom the evidence in their favor. Townsend v. Cooper, 759 F.3d\n678, 685 (7th Cir. 2014).\n   The FDCPA prohibits various \u201cabusive debt collection\npractices,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e), including the use of false or\nmisleading representations, id. \u00a7 1692e, and other unfair\npractices, id. \u00a7 1692f, to collect any debt. Franklin and Chism\ncontend that Parking Revenue\u2019s collection letters violate the\nFDCPA in several ways. 3 Our present concern, however, is\n\n2 The suit also named Bryon Bellerud II, an attorney for Parking Revenue\nresponsible for sending the collection letters. The judge entered an order\nof default against Bellerud because he failed to answer or otherwise\nplead. As we\u2019ve just explained, however, the judge later concluded that\nthe FDCPA is inapplicable.\n3Franklin and Chism allege that the letters (1) falsely represented that in\norder to avoid a presumption of the debt\u2019s validity, they must dispute the\ncharges and fees in writing; (2) attempted to collect the additional $45\ncharge without express authorization to impose the charge; and (3) made\n\fNo. 14-3774                                                          5\n\nlimited to the threshold question whether the FDCPA even\napplies. That question turns on whether the underlying\npayment obligations are debts within the meaning of\n\u00a7 1692a(5). If they are, then the FDCPA applies and sum-\nmary judgment was improper.\n    Section 1692a(5) defines a \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201cany obligation or\nalleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of\na transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or\nservices which are the subject of the transaction are primari-\nly for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d\n    Two parts of the definition need further explanation.\nFirst, although the statute does not define \u201ctransaction,\u201d we\nhave held that the term is \u201ca broad reference to many differ-\nent types of business dealings between parties.\u201d Bass v.\nStolper, Koritzinsky, Brewster & Neider, S.C., 111 F.3d 1322,\n1325 (7th Cir. 1997). Next, the \u201carising out of\u201d language\nlimits the FDCPA\u2019s reach to only those obligations that are\ncreated by the contracts the parties used to give legal force to\ntheir transaction. Id. at 1326. This means that, in general,\nefforts to collect on obligations that are created by other\nkinds of legal authorities, like tort law or traffic regulations,\nare not covered by the FDCPA.\n   The parties rightly agree that if Franklin\u2019s and Chism\u2019s\nobligations arise out of contract law, they are debts covered\nby the FDCPA. And it\u2019s clear that contract law is the source\nof the obligations at issue here. Indeed, at oral argument\nParking Revenue\u2019s attorney was unable to explain what\n\n\nfalse, deceptive, or misleading representations. The judge didn\u2019t reach\nthe merits of these arguments because he concluded that the FDCPA was\ninapplicable.\n\f6                                                  No. 14-3774\n\nsource of law other than contract could have created the\nobligations that its letters attempted to collect. By parking in\nthe lot, Franklin and Chism accepted CPS\u2019s offer to park at\nthe stated cost. At that moment a contract was formed\nobligating them to pay the stated price or pay a higher price\nif they left the parking lot without paying.\n    It matters not that Metra owns the lot, or that the contract\nbetween Metra and CPS sometimes refers to the $45 non-\npayment charge as a \u201cfine.\u201d The crucial question is the legal\nsource of the obligation. Although Metra is a governmental\nagency, no municipal ordinance or regulation obligates\npark-and-dashers to pay the $45; that obligation comes from\nthe contract that is formed when a customer parks in the lot.\nMetra owns these lots like any other parking-lot proprietor\nand contracts with CPS to operate them. That contract\nprovides that any dispute between \u201cpatron[s]\u201d (parkers) and\n\u201c[o]perator\u201d (CPS) shall be handled \u201cas a matter of con-\ntract.\u201d So the district judge\u2019s analogy to fines assessed for\nnonpayment at municipal parking meters was inapt. These\nobligations have no source in municipal law.\n    The judge\u2019s analogy to theft was also inapt. The judge\nthought a car parker\u2019s failure to pay resembled the condition\nof the thief that we described in Bass. There we noted that\nthe FDCPA doesn\u2019t cover a thief\u2019s obligation to pay for the\ngoods he steals if his obligation is created by tort law (e.g.,\nthe tort of conversion), see RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS\n\u00a7 222A (Am. Law Inst. 1965), rather than by contract law, see\nBass, 111 F.3d at 1326. The obligations at issue here, howev-\ner, are not premised on the tort of conversion; they are\npremised exclusively on the contract that was formed be-\ntween Franklin and Chism on one side and CPS on the other.\n\fNo. 14-3774                                                  7\n\nThis distinction between contract and tort is the reason that\nthe obligation incurred after paying with a bad check gives\nrise to a \u201cdebt\u201d under the FDCPA while shoplifting does not.\nSee id. at 1325. When the check is tendered for payment, a\ncontract is formed. See id.\n    To conclude: The signs at the parking lot offered a park-\ning spot to all comers for $1.50 per day and noted a penalty\nfor failing to pay. Franklin and Chism each accepted this\noffer\u2014and thus formed a contract\u2014when they parked in the\nlot. Their obligation to pay the $46.50 is premised entirely on\nthis contract. Parking Revenue was therefore attempting to\ncollect debts, and its attempts are regulated by the FDCPA\u2019s\nprotections.\n                                                    REVERSED.\n\f",
