Lewis appeals from his plea-based convictions and sentences in the district\ncourt for Lancaster County for aiding and abetting robbery in case No. A-17-899, and for another\ncount of aiding and abetting robbery in case No. A-17-900. The two cases were consolidated for\nplea and sentencing purposes in the district court and have been consolidated on appeal. Here,\nLewis contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that his sentences were\nexcessive. Upon our review, we find the record insufficient to address many of Lewis\u2019 assertions\nregarding ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. Other claims of ineffective assistance\nwere either affirmatively refuted by the record or stated with insufficient particularity to raise them\non direct appeal and preserve them for later review. Additionally, we find that Lewis\u2019 sentences\nfor his convictions for aiding and abetting robbery were not excessive. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -1-\n\f                                        II. BACKGROUND\n         On July 8, 2016, the State filed informations in the district court in both cases at issue in\nthis appeal. In case No. A-17-899, the State charged Lewis with aiding and abetting robbery in\nviolation of Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-206 (Reissue 2016) and Neb. Rev. Stat. 28-324 (Reissue 2016),\na Class II felony. The charges in case No. A-17-899 stemmed from events occurring on April 18,\n2016. In case No. A-17-900, the State charged Lewis with robbery in violation of \u00a7 28-324, a\nClass II felony; two counts of first degree false imprisonment in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 28-314 (Reissue 2016), both Class IIIA felonies; child abuse in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 28-707(1) and (4) (Reissue 2016), a Class IIIA felony; and two counts of terroristic threats in\nviolation of Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-311.01 (Reissue 2016), both Class IIIA felonies. The charges in\ncase No. A-17-900 stemmed from events occurring on December 29, 2015.\n         On July 17, 2017, a plea hearing was held in the district court. The State informed the court\nthat the parties had \u201ca three-case plea compromise.\u201d The State indicated that Lewis would be\npleading to the charge in case No. A-17-899. The State asked the court for leave to file an amended\ninformation in case No. A-17-900 and indicated that Lewis would be pleading to the amended\ninformation in that case. The amended information in case No. A-17-900 charged Lewis with one\ncount of aiding and abetting robbery in violation of \u00a7 28-206 and \u00a7 28-324, a Class II felony.\nFinally, the State indicated that it would be dismissing a third case in which Lewis had been\ncharged with theft by unlawful taking, a Class IV felony. We note that Lewis was represented by\none attorney in the two cases on appeal and by another attorney in the case that was dismissed\npursuant to the plea agreement. Both of Lewis\u2019 attorneys were present at the plea hearing.\n         After Lewis waived 24-hour notice and reading of the amended information, as well as a\npreliminary hearing, in case No. A-17-900, the State arraigned him on the amended information\nin that case and re-arraigned him on the information in case No. A-17-899. During the arraignment\nportion of the hearing, Lewis indicated his understanding of the nature of the charges and possible\npenalties in both cases.\n         Upon the district court\u2019s inquiry, Lewis informed the court that he was pleading guilty to\nthe amended charge in case No. A-17-900 and the charge in case No. A-17-899. The court then\nexplained and Lewis indicated his understanding of his constitutional rights, the consequences of\npleading guilty, the nature of the charges, and the possible penalties. The court explained that any\nsentence imposed in case No. A-17-899 \u201ccould be consecutive, that is in addition to the sentence\nat [case No. A-17-900].\u201d Based on Lewis\u2019 response, the court explained further that this meant\n\u201c[o]ne after the other,\u201d and Lewis indicated his understanding.\n         The State then provided a detailed factual basis for the charges to which Lewis was\npleading in both cases, which we summarize below.\n         The factual basis provided for case No. A-17-900 showed that on December 29, 2015,\nLewis and another male individual (the second man) showed up at an apartment to look at the TV\nthat the resident there had to sell and also \u201ca PS4.\u201d Another individual who \u201cwas going to be there\nwith the PS4\u201d had not arrived yet. The apartment resident did not know Lewis, only discovering\nhis name later \u201cthrough friends and social media,\u201d but she knew the second man \u201cupon sight from\nprevious contact.\u201d Upon the men\u2019s inquiry, the resident told them that the person bringing the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f\u201cPS4\u201d would be there in about 10 to 15 minutes. The second man said, \u201cGood, because we are\ngoing to rob you all,\u201d and both he and Lewis pulled out black semiautomatic handguns. The\nresident reported to police that the second man placed a gun to her head, told her to sit on the\ncouch, and told her that \u201cif there was any funny business, they would both put clips in her.\u201d\n        While the two men were waiting for the individual with the \u201cPS4,\u201d the resident\u2019s friend\narrived unexpectedly. The resident reported to police that the second man grabbed the friend,\npointed his gun at her head, made her sit on the couch, and told her that they would shoot her \u201cif\nshe moved or tried anything.\u201d When the friend informed the two men that her 4-year-old daughter\nwas still in her car, the men told her that she could not go get her child. Lewis then retrieved the\nchild and brought her into the apartment. Lewis forced the child into the back bedroom and told\nher to stay there and play with toys. The friend was not allowed to leave the couch or comfort her\nchild. The child was \u201crestrained in the back room\u201d during the remainder of the robbery.\n        The two men took $550 from the resident\u2019s entertainment center, $400 from her kitchen,\nand $100 from her pocket. When the individual who was to be bringing the \u201cPS4\u201d arrived, the\nsecond man threw him to the ground. The two men took an unknown amount of money from this\nindividual\u2019s wallet as well as his car keys, but they did not take his car. The resident reported to\npolice that later in the evening, she had \u201ctext conversations or contact\u201d with the second man about\ntrying to get the car keys back, and the second man told her he wanted more money in return for\nthe keys. Both the resident and the friend positively identified Lewis and the second man, in\nseparate photo arrays, as the men that \u201crobbed them at gunpoint.\u201d\n        The factual basis provided for case No. A-17-899 showed that on April 18, 2016, police\nwere dispatched to a call regarding gunshots being heard at a particular residential address.\nDispatchers relayed incoming information, including a general description of a possible suspect\nwho was seen leaving the residence around the time of the shooting. When police arrived at the\nlocation, they found two adult victims and a dog all suffering from gunshot wounds. There were\nalso several small children present in the residence. Medical personnel confirmed that one of the\nadult shooting victims was deceased; the other adult shooting victim was transported to the hospital\nwhere he received extensive medical treatment for his wounds. Shortly after the original dispatch,\npolice located a man matching the general description of the suspect, walking less than three blocks\nfrom the residence. The man was later identified as Lewis. Lewis told police he was at the\nresidence when the shots were fired. He was detained, arrested on an active warrant, and\ntransported to the police department for an interview. When Lewis was taken into custody, he had\nmarijuana on his person, and a search of the crime scene revealed marijuana, cash, and materials\nconsistent with the packaging of narcotics for distribution.\n        During his interview with police, Lewis described his visit to the residence to purchase\nmarijuana, including his observations of others present at the scene. He told police that as he was\nleaving the residence after completing his purchase, he observed a man in a puffy black coat\nwaiting on the front porch. The man then entered the residence and Lewis heard someone inside\nyell, followed by a series of gunshots. Lewis told police he immediately ran from the residence\nand hid behind some bushes until the man left the area. Lewis stated that he returned to the\nresidence, looked through the open door, and observed someone lying on the floor with a small\nchild standing next to him. Lewis stated that he then walked away from the residence and was\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fcontacted by police. In a second interview at the jail, Lewis told investigators he knew the man\nwho went into the residence just before the shooting, that the man was drawing a pistol as he\nentered the residence, and that Lewis feared retaliation.\n         The factual basis indicated that witnesses corroborated portions of Lewis\u2019 statements to\npolice, but witnesses contradicted his statement that he did not arrive at the residence with anyone\nelse as well as his statement that he was not inside the residence during or after the shooting. A\nwitness described a person matching Lewis\u2019 description, who the witness observed returning to\nthe residence after the shooting to retrieve an unknown item. The witness observed that the man\nin the puffy black coat was holding something under his coat as he was leaving the residence and\nthat this man and the man matching Lewis\u2019 description left in separate directions after the shooting.\n         After the State provided the factual bases for Lewis\u2019 pleas, Lewis\u2019 attorney observed that\nthere had been a lengthy investigation of both of these incidents and told the district court that the\nfacts regarding the December 29, 2015 incident were \u201csomewhat different than what was originally\nreported, which was what [the prosecutor] just read to you.\u201d He stated further:\n                  I think the true facts are that [a man], accompanied by [Lewis], went to the . . .\n         residence to make a drug purchase from [two individuals].\n                  [One of the individuals] wasn\u2019t there at the time, and when [Lewis\u2019 companion]\n         was unable to get the terms of the transaction he wanted, he became angry and decided to\n         take it from them, and then pulled the handgun. So nothing to do with the PS, PlayStation\n         machine or anything, it was a drug transaction that [Lewis] accompanied [another man] to\n         that location and then it went bad, and [the other man] decided he was going to take it from\n         them. I think that\u2019s what later investigation revealed and that\u2019s what [Lewis] told the\n         officers. I think they believed that, that\u2019s what the true facts were. It had nothing to do with\n         the PlayStation.\n\n         Following these statements by Lewis\u2019 attorney, the district court asked Lewis whether he\naided and abetted a robbery in each of these cases. Lewis responded affirmatively and affirmed\nthat his attorney explained each of the charges to him. The court also asked a series of questions\nreferencing both of Lewis\u2019 attorneys. In response to these questions, Lewis affirmed that he had\nhad an adequate amount of time to discuss these matters, had gone over all of the facts and possible\nconsequences, and had discussed all possible defenses he may have to the charges with his\nattorneys. Lewis also affirmed that he had told his attorneys everything he knows about these\nmatters and that his attorneys were competently representing him.\n         The prosecutor then restated the terms of the \u201cthree-case plea agreement,\u201d and Lewis and\nboth of his attorneys affirmed their understanding of the agreement as it had been stated. Upon the\ndistrict court\u2019s inquiry, Lewis affirmed that, other than the plea agreement, no one had made any\npromise or threats or used any force or inducement to get him to plead guilty; that no one had made\nhim any promises as to what his actual sentences would be; that he still wished to plead guilty to\nthe charges and was doing so freely, voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently; and that he was\npleading guilty because he was, in fact, guilty of the charges. Both of Lewis\u2019 attorneys affirmed\ntheir respective belief that Lewis\u2019 pleas were consistent with the law and the facts and that Lewis\nwas pleading freely, voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f        The district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a sufficient factual basis\nto accept Lewis\u2019 pleas in both cases; that Lewis understood the nature of the charges, his rights,\nand the consequences of his pleas; and that his pleas were made freely, voluntarily, knowingly,\nand intelligently. The court accepted Lewis\u2019 pleas and found him guilty of the charge in both cases.\n        A sentencing hearing was held on August 3, 2017. After hearing comments by the State,\nLewis, and his attorney in the two cases in which Lewis pled guilty, the district court imposed\nsentence in both cases. The court stated that it had considered the comments of Lewis and his\nattorney and all of the information provided in the presentence investigation report. The court\nstated that it had also given \u201csignificant consideration\u201d to the fact that Lewis cooperated with law\nenforcement. The court stated further:\n        However, I cannot ignore the serious nature of each of these crimes, the violent nature of\n        each crime. Firearms involved in each crime. In the one robbery case, . . . you went out to\n        a car and brought a four-year-old into an armed robbery. And I realize you\u2019ve stated you\n        were trying to protect the child, but you brought the child into a dangerous setting, where\n        . . . an armed robbery was in progress.\n                  With respect to the other robbery, . . . that resulted in the death of one individual.\n        And the other person was shot and forever changed. That person is paralyzed now. And I\n        can\u2019t ignore the serious nature of those crimes. Any sentence I impose has to take into\n        consideration the protection of the public.\n\nIn case No. A-17-899, the court sentenced Lewis to imprisonment for a period of 25 to 35 years\nand gave him credit for 468 days of time previously served. The court imposed a consecutive\nsentence of 25 to 35 years in case No. A-17-900. On August 3, the court entered orders\nmemorializing Lewis\u2019 sentences in both cases.\n                                 III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n        Lewis asserts that (1) he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel in various regards\nand (2) the district court abused its discretion by ordering him to serve excessive sentences.\n                                   IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n        Whether a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel may be determined on direct\nappeal is a question of law. State v. Vanness, 300 Neb. 159, 912 N.W.2d 736 (2018). In reviewing\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, an appellate court decides only whether\nthe undisputed facts contained within the record are sufficient to conclusively determine whether\ncounsel did or did not provide effective assistance and whether the defendant was or was not\nprejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance. Id.\n        An appellate court will not disturb a sentence imposed within the statutory limits absent an\nabuse of discretion by the trial court. State v. Steele, 300 Neb. 617, 915 N.W.2d 560 (2018). A\njudicial abuse of discretion exists when the reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable,\nunfairly depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in matters submitted for\ndisposition. State v. Clemens, 300 Neb. 601, 915 N.W.2d 550 (2018).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f                                          V. ANALYSIS\n                             1. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n        Lewis asserts that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel in various regards. He\nis represented on direct appeal by different counsel than trial counsel. When a defendant\u2019s trial\ncounsel is different from his or her counsel on direct appeal, the defendant must raise on direct\nappeal any issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffective performance which is known to the defendant or is\napparent from the record. State v. Wells, 300 Neb. 296, 912 N.W.2d 896 (2018). Otherwise, the\nissue will be procedurally barred. Id.\n        Appellate courts have generally reached ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct\nappeal only in those instances where it was clear from the record that such claims were without\nmerit or in the rare case where trial counsel\u2019s error was so egregious and resulted in such a high\nlevel of prejudice that no tactic or strategy could overcome the effect of the error, which effect was\na fundamentally unfair trial. State v. Casares, 291 Neb. 150, 864 N.W.2d 667 (2015). An\nineffective assistance of counsel claim will not be addressed on direct appeal if it requires an\nevidentiary hearing. State v. Nolt, 298 Neb. 910, 906 N.W.2d 309 (2018).\n        When an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is raised in a direct appeal, the appellant\nis not required to allege prejudice; however, an appellant must make specific allegations of the\nconduct that he or she claims constitutes deficient performance by trial counsel. State v. Casares,\nsupra. General allegations that trial counsel performed deficiently or that trial counsel was\nineffective are insufficient to raise an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal and thereby\npreserve the issue for later review. Id. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim made on direct\nappeal can be found to be without merit if the record establishes that trial counsel\u2019s performance\nwas not deficient or that the appellant could not establish prejudice. Id.\n        To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the defendant must show that his or her\ncounsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that this deficient performance actually prejudiced the\ndefendant\u2019s defense. State v. Taylor, 300 Neb. 629, 915 N.W.2d 568 (2018). To show deficient\nperformance, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance did not equal that of a lawyer\nwith ordinary training and skill in criminal law. State v. Wells, supra. The prejudice requirement\nin a plea context is satisfied if the defendant shows a reasonable probability that but for the errors\nof counsel, the defendant would have insisted on going to trial rather than pleading guilty. State v.\nHaynes, 299 Neb. 249, 908 N.W.2d 40 (2018). A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient\nto undermine confidence in the outcome. State v. Wells, supra. The two prongs of the ineffective\nassistance of counsel test under Strickland v. Washington, supra, may be addressed in either order,\nand the entire ineffectiveness analysis should be viewed with a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s\nactions were reasonable. State v. Taylor, supra.\n        When reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, trial counsel is afforded due\ndeference to formulate trial strategy and tactics, and an appellate court will not second-guess\nreasonable strategic decisions by counsel. State v. Nolt, supra. When considering whether trial\ncounsel\u2019s performance was deficient, there is a strong presumption that counsel acted reasonably.\nId.\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f       Lewis asserts that his right to effective assistance of trial counsel was violated in the\nfollowing ways:\n                1) [His] attorney improperly advised him that if he cooperated with the prosecution\n       that [he] could expect a plea offer of one count of [a]iding and [a]betting a [r]obbery.\n                2) [His] attorney improperly advised him that if he cooperated and accepted the\n       plea offer by the State of pleading to two Class [II] [f]elonies of [a]iding and [a]betting a\n       felony that the most he would be sentenced to [was] 10 years[\u2019] imprisonment.\n                3) [His] attorney did not properly advise him by telling him if he did not give a\n       statement to the investigating law enforcement officers that [the] State would vacate the\n       plea deal and he would be charged with far more serious crimes.\n                4) [He] was improperly advised by his attorney and pressured into pleading guilty\n       to two counts of [a]iding and [a]betting a Class [II] [f]elony under the threat that if he did\n       not cooperate[,] the charges against the mother of his child would not be dropped and she\n       would be charged with murder.\n                5) [He] was improperly advised by his attorney and pressured into pleading to two\n       counts of [a]iding and [a]betting a Class [II] [f]elony by his trial attorney threatening to\n       withdraw from hi[s] case and [that] he would be charged with a homicide and would stay\n       in jail for another year and [a] half.\n                6) [He] was improperly advised by his attorney under the promise that if he\n       cooperated with the State and [pled] to two counts of [a]iding and [a]betting a Class [II]\n       [f]elony[,] the prosecution and trial counsel would ask the [c]ourt to order the sentences to\n       be served concurrently.\n                7) [His] attorney improperly allowed [him] to plead to two counts of [a]iding and\n       [a]betting a Class [II] [f]elony when trial counsel knew or should have known the pleas\n       were not knowingly, voluntarily[,] and intelligently made.\n                8) [He] was advised by his attorney to enter into a plea agreement on July 7,[ ]2017,\n       despite [his] informing his attorney that [a codefendant] threatened him with a gun to\n       accompany him to each of the crimes Lewis[] was charged with and consequently\n       abandoning and or waiving any potential defense Lewis may have had to the charges.\n                9) [He] was not properly advised by his attorney, prior to entering his [guilty] pleas,\n       as to the direct criminal consequences of those pleas.\n                10) [His] attorney permitted [him] to be sentenced based on an involuntary,\n       knowingly[,] and intelligent plea and should have asked to continue the sentencing and\n       move to withdraw his plea of guilty.\n                11) Absent the deficient performance of his attorney, Lewis would not have entered\n       his pleas of guilty, [and] would not have been sentenced to [25 to 35 years] in prison on\n       each count.\n\nBrief for appellant at 14-16. Except for the allegations in Lewis\u2019 claim 10, the allegations above\nwere both assigned as error and argued in his brief. Because claim 10 was not both specifically\nassigned and specifically argued, we do not consider it further. An alleged error must be both\nspecifically assigned and specifically argued in the brief of the party asserting the error to be\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fconsidered by an appellate court. State v. Dill, 300 Neb. 344, 913 N.W.2d 470 (2018). An appellate\ncourt does not consider errors which are argued but not assigned. Id. We address Lewis\u2019 remaining\nclaims below.\n                             (a) Claims Record Insufficient to Address\n        Lewis\u2019 allegations in claims 3, 4, 5, and 8 involve discussions with his trial counsel and\ninformation not present in the record. Accordingly, we conclude that while stated with sufficient\nparticularity to raise them on direct appeal and preserve them for later review, these claims cannot\nbe adequately reviewed on direct appeal.\n                                   (b) Claims Refuted by Record\n        Lewis\u2019 claims 1, 2, 6, and 9 are affirmatively refuted by the record. In these claims, Lewis\nargues his attorney improperly advised him that if he cooperated with the prosecution, he could\nexpect a plea offer of one count (as opposed to two); and that if he accepted the State\u2019s plea offer\nof pleading to two counts, he would receive a sentence of no more than 10 years and that the\nprosecutor and his attorney would ask the district court to order concurrent sentences. He also\nargues that his attorney did not properly advise him prior to pleading as to the \u201cdirect criminal\nconsequences\u201d of his pleas. Brief for appellant at 16.\n        At the plea hearing, Lewis was informed by the prosecutor during the arraignment portion\nof the hearing of the nature of the charges to which he was pleading and the possible penalties.\nLater in the hearing, he was informed by the district court of the nature of the charges and possible\npenalties, including the fact that the court could impose consecutive sentences. At both points\nduring the hearing, Lewis affirmed his understanding of both the nature of the charges and the\npossible penalties. Lewis was also informed by the court and stated his understanding of the\nconsequences of pleading guilty. Finally, the details of the plea agreement in this case were stated\nboth at the beginning and near the end of the plea hearing. Those recitations of the agreement do\nnot reflect that a sentencing recommendation was part of the agreement. When the court asked if\nthe agreement as recited near the end of the hearing reflected Lewis\u2019 understanding of the\nagreement, he responded affirmatively. Lewis affirmed, upon inquiry by the court, that no one had\nmade him any promises as to the actual sentences for the charges to which he was pleading. Lewis\u2019\narguments with respect to claims 1, 2, 6, and 9 are without merit. See State v. Cotton, 299 Neb.\n650, 910 N.W.2d 102 (2018) (claim of ineffective assistance may be resolved on direct appeal\nwhen record is sufficient to affirmatively rebut merits of claim).\n                           (c) Claims Pled With Insufficient Particularity\n         Finally, Lewis\u2019 claims 7 and 11 have not been alleged with sufficient particularity to raise\nthem on direct appeal and properly preserve them for later review. See State v. Casares, 291 Neb.\n150, 864 N.W.2d 667 (2015). An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is raised on direct appeal\nwhen allegations of deficient performance are made with enough particularity for (1) an appellate\ncourt to make a determination of whether the claim can be decided upon the trial record and (2) a\ndistrict court later reviewing a petition for postconviction relief to be able to recognize whether the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fclaim was brought before the appellate court. State v. Vanness, 300 Neb. 159, 912 N.W.2d 736\n(2018).\n         In claim 7, Lewis asserts that his attorney improperly allowed him to enter his pleas when\nhis attorney knew or should have known the pleas were not knowingly, voluntarily, and\nintelligently made. Lewis does not specify any basis for why the pleas were not knowingly,\nvoluntarily, and intelligently made or how his attorney should have known of this issue. This claim\nhas not been stated with sufficient particularity to raise it on direct appeal.\n         In claim 11, Lewis asserts that absent his attorney\u2019s deficient performance, he would not\nhave entered his pleas of guilty and would not have been sentenced to 25 to 35 years in prison on\neach count to which he pled. In this claim, Lewis has not made specific allegations of the conduct\nthat he or she claims constitutes deficient performance by trial counsel. See State v. Casares, supra.\nThus, when claim 11 is viewed in isolation, it has not been stated with sufficient particularity to\nraise it on direct appeal.\n         To the extent Lewis intended the allegations in claim 11 to refer to the deficient\nperformance alleged in claims 3, 4, 5, and 8, we again note that those claims cannot be adequately\nreviewed on direct appeal.\n                                      2. EXCESSIVE SENTENCE\n        Lewis asserts that the district court abused its discretion by ordering him to serve excessive\nsentences. Lewis pled guilty to two counts of aiding and abetting robbery and was sentenced to\nconsecutive sentences of 25 to 35 years on each count. Aiding and abetting robbery is a Class II\nfelony punishable by 1 to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment. \u00a7 28-206; \u00a7 28-324; Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-105\n(Supp. 2017). The sentences imposed by the court for Lewis\u2019 convictions were within the statutory\nlimits.\n        Where a sentence imposed within the statutory limits is alleged on appeal to be excessive,\nthe appellate court must determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion in considering\nand applying the relevant factors as well as any applicable legal principles in determining the\nsentence to be imposed. State v. Steele, 300 Neb. 617, 915 N.W.2d 560 (2018). In determining a\nsentence to be imposed, relevant factors customarily considered and applied are the defendant\u2019s\n(1) age, (2) mentality, (3) education and experience, (4) social and cultural background, (5) past\ncriminal record or record of law-abiding conduct, and (6) motivation for the offense, as well as (7)\nthe nature of the offense and (8) the amount of violence involved in the commission of the crime.\nId. The sentencing court is not limited to any mathematically applied set of factors. State v.\nPhillips, 297 Neb. 469, 900 N.W.2d 522 (2017). The appropriateness of a sentence is necessarily\na subjective judgment and includes the sentencing judge\u2019s observation of the defendant\u2019s\ndemeanor and attitude and all the facts and circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s life. State\nv. Steele, supra.\n        Lewis argues that the sentences imposed were extreme and disproportionate to his\nbackground and the nature of his involvement in the crimes of which he was convicted. Lewis was\n21 years old at the time of the presentence investigation in this case. He attended school through\nthe 11th grade and completed his GED while in jail. He is in a relationship and has a 1-year-old\nson. Lewis\u2019 prior criminal history is not extensive; in addition to the present offenses, he has been\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fpreviously convicted of offenses such as possession of marijuana less than 1 ounce, criminal\ntrespass, theft by receiving, and operating motor vehicle to avoid arrest; has received some traffic\nviolations; and had contact with law enforcement that led to charges of theft by unlawful taking\nthat were dismissed pursuant to the three-case plea bargain discussed above. He is clearly\nremorseful for the present offenses. However, on the Level of Service/Case Management\nInventory, Lewis scored in the high risk to reoffend category.\n        A review of the record from the sentencing hearing shows that the district court considered\nthe relevant factors, including Lewis\u2019 cooperation with law enforcement. The court indicated,\nhowever, that it could not ignore the serious nature of the crimes in each case. The court did not\nabuse its discretion in considering the relevant factors and did not impose excessive sentences.\nAccordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019 sentences following his convictions for aiding and abetting\nrobbery.\n                                       VI. CONCLUSION\n        We have addressed Lewis\u2019 assertions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel as set\nforth above. With respect to sentencing, the district court did not abuse its discretion or impose\nexcessive sentences.\n                                                                                        AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f",
