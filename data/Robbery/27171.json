Harmon (Appellant) appeals from the motion court\u2019s judgment denying his\n\nRule 24.0351 motion for post-conviction relief. Because Appellant absconded from probation for\n\nnearly two years, we use our discretion to invoke the escape rule and dismiss Points I and II.\n\nFinding the motion court did not clearly in denying Point III, we affirm.\n\n                                       Factual and Procedural Background\n\n           The State of Missouri (State) charged Appellant in January 2013 with class B felony\n\nstealing. At his March 2014 plea hearing, Appellant pleaded guilty, admitting that while\n\nemployed by a company that contracted with AT&T, he stole cellular phones, tablets, and other\n\naccessories with a retail value of approximately $106,000. Appellant was advised before\n\npleading guilty that the range of punishment for class B felony stealing was five to fifteen years\n\n\n\n1\n    Rule references are to Mo. R. Crim. P. (2019) unless otherwise indicated.\n\fin the Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC). The trial court deferred sentencing at\n\nAppellant\u2019s request to allow time to investigate the amount of restitution Appellant would owe.\n\n       Appellant was sentenced in May 2014. The prosecutor recommended a five-year\n\nsentence, but stated that if the court were going to grant probation, the parties had agreed to\n\nrestitution of $25,000, payable at $425 per month over five years. Appellant requested the court\n\nsuspend imposition of sentence and place him on probation. The trial court indicated it was\n\nwilling to suspend imposition of sentence, but stated that if Appellant was not successful on\n\nprobation, the court could sentence him to fifteen years. Appellant stated he understood. The\n\ntrial court sentenced Appellant to five years in the DOC, suspended imposition of sentence, and\n\nplaced Appellant on five years\u2019 probation. Appellant was also ordered to pay restitution of\n\n$25,000, payable at $425 per month, beginning in June 2014. Noting Appellant was\n\nunemployed, the trial court told him that if he was not initially able to make the payments, then\n\nhe needed to make whatever payments he could and the trial court would work with him.\n\n       In September 2014, the State filed a notice of probation violation based on non-payment\n\nof restitution. The trial court suspended Appellant\u2019s probation and ordered a warrant. In\n\nOctober 2014, the court quashed the warrant and set the case for a probation violation hearing in\n\nDecember 2014. Defense counsel advised the court that Appellant would pay the past due\n\nrestitution amount by the date of the hearing. In December 2014, the court continued the case to\n\nthe probation revocation docket in February 2015, \u201cfor status of restitution,\u201d and Appellant\n\nsigned the continuance order. However, Appellant failed to appear, so the trial court suspended\n\nAppellant\u2019s probation and issued another warrant. On March 4, 2015, Appellant requested a\n\nbond reduction, and on March 6, the court set his bond at $750. On March 19, 2015, Appellant\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\frequested another bond reduction, and on March 20, the court ordered Appellant be released on\n\npersonal recognizance and probation remain suspended.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s probation revocation hearing was continued several times in early 2015 at his\n\nrequest. In May 2015, Appellant failed to appear, and the trial court ordered a warrant for the\n\nthird time. More than a year later, Appellant was taken into custody. In June 2016, the trial\n\ncourt set a bond of $1,000 and set the case for August 2016. In July, Appellant posted the bond\n\nand promised to appear on August 5, 2016. On August 5, Appellant appeared and requested a\n\ncontinuance. The case was continued five additional times at the request of Appellant. In July\n\n2017, Appellant failed to appear. The court ordered a fourth warrant. Approximately seven\n\nmonths later, Appellant was taken into custody and the court set the case for a probation\n\nviolation hearing in April 2018.\n\n       On April 20, 2018, Appellant appeared, waived his right to a hearing and admitted he had\n\nviolated his probation by failing to report. The court revoked Appellant\u2019s probation. The\n\nprosecutor stated he was \u201copen to whatever [disposition] the Court wants to do.\u201d Appellant,\n\nrepresented by a different attorney (probation revocation counsel), asked the court to \u201ckeep him\n\non some sort of probation.\u201d Appellant prayed for mercy, and asked the court \u201cto give [him] one\n\nmore chance.\u201d The court stated Appellant had \u201chad more than [his] share\u201d of \u201csecond chances.\u201d\n\nThe court indicated Appellant\u2019s conduct had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and observed, \u201cNo\n\nmatter what opportunity you were given, it\u2019s never happened.\u201d The court continued:\n\n       And, you know, I have no \u2013 no sympathy really at this point. Basically you\u2019ve just\n       thumbed your nose at this Court. And it\u2019s taken a lot of effort to get you back here\n       in order to make this happen. And I just \u2013 my inclination, frankly, was to give you\n       15 years. But your attorney has worked very diligently on your behalf. I, you\n       know, have given you some opportunity because of him and it\u2019s still not\n       happening. We\u2019re still in the same boat we\u2019ve been in for four years. So I just can\n       not \u2013 I can\u2019t condone it. I can\u2019t see anything changing.\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f       The court sentenced Appellant to five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n       On September 17, 2018, Appellant timely filed a pro se motion pursuant to Rule 24.035.\n\nOn September 25, 2018, the court appointed counsel to represent Appellant. On November 27,\n\n2018, the court granted a 30-day extension to file an amended motion. The transcript of the\n\nguilty plea and initial sentencing hearing (where no sentence was imposed) was filed on January\n\n10, 2019. The transcript of the sentencing hearing (after probation was revoked) was filed on\n\nSeptember 30, 2019. On April 8, 2019, Appellant timely filed an amended motion alleging (1)\n\nhe was denied due process of law because his stealing offense was a misdemeanor under State v.\n\nBazell, 497 S.W.3d 263 (Mo. 2016), and his five-year sentence exceeded the authorized\n\npunishment; (2) plea counsel was ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the felony charge and\n\nfailing to advise Appellant that he was charged only with a misdemeanor; and (3) probation\n\nrevocation counsel was ineffective for failing to argue the conviction should be amended to a\n\nmisdemeanor and Appellant should be sentenced to no more than one year\u2019s incarceration.\n\n       On July 10, 2019, the motion court denied Appellant\u2019s post-conviction motion. Relying\n\non this Court\u2019s opinion in Hamilton v. State, No. ED106540, 2019 WL 1339642 (Mo. App. Mar.\n\n26, 2019), the court ruled Appellant\u2019s claims were substantively without merit. This appeal\n\nfollows.\n\n                                        Points Relied On\n\n       In his first point, Appellant claims he was denied due process of law because his stealing\n\noffense was a misdemeanor under State v. Bazell and his five-year sentence exceeded the\n\nauthorized punishment. In his second point, Appellant claims plea counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to move to dismiss the felony charge and failing to advise Appellant that he was charged\n\nonly with a misdemeanor offense. In his third point, he claims probation revocation counsel was\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fineffective for failing to argue the conviction should be amended to a misdemeanor and\n\nAppellant should be sentenced to no more than one year\u2019s incarceration.\n\n                                            Discussion\n\n       Before we address the merits of Appellant\u2019s appeal, we address the State\u2019s argument that\n\nwe apply the escape rule to this case.\n\n               The escape rule is a judicially-created doctrine that operates to deny the\n       right of appeal to a defendant who escapes justice. The escape rule applies to\n       appeals on the merits as well as to motions for post-conviction relief under Rules\n       29.15 and 24.035. The escape rule can be invoked to dismiss post-conviction\n       appeals regardless of whether the motion court reaches the merits of a movant\u2019s\n       claim or dismisses the motion based on its application of the escape rule. The\n       escape rule applies to errors that occur prior and up to the time of escape, but\n       errors occurring after recapture remain appealable.\n\nMcNeil v. State, 514 S.W.3d 63, 65 (Mo. App. E.D. 2017), citing Nichols v. State, 131 S.W.3d\n\n863, 865 (Mo. App. E.D. 2004). \u201cWhether to dismiss an appeal for this reason is left to the\n\nsound discretion of the appellate tribunal.\u201d Stevens v. State, 306 S.W.3d 175, 177 (Mo. App.\n\nS.D. 2010), citing State v. Troupe, 891 S.W.2d 808, 811 (Mo. banc 1995).\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Points I and II on appeal both allege errors that were made at the time of his\n\noriginal plea and sentencing hearings in 2014. Therefore, our discretion to deny review of\n\nAppellant\u2019s appeal as the State requests must be limited to Points I and II.\n\n       \u201cDismissal of a defendant\u2019s appeal pursuant to the escape rule is warranted where a\n\ndefendant\u2019s escape from justice results in a lengthy delay in their criminal case causing an\n\n\u2018adverse impact on the criminal justice system.\u2019\u201d McNeil, 514 S.W.3d at 65, quoting Troupe,\n\n891 S.W.2d at 811.\n\n       Barring the appeal of an escaping defendant has been justified on the following\n       grounds: (1) the need for a court to have control over the defendant before\n       deciding his or her appeal; (2) curtailing administrative problems caused by a\n       defendant's long absence; (3) preventing prejudice to the State in the event the\n       case is remanded for a new trial; (4) preventing a defendant from selectively\n\n                                                 5\n\f       abiding by court decisions; (5) discouraging escape; (6) encouraging voluntary\n       surrender; (7) preserving respect for the criminal justice system; and (8)\n       promoting the dignified operation of the appellate courts.\n\nStevens, 306 S.W.3d at 177, citing Pradt v. State, 219 S.W.3d 858, 862 (Mo. App. S.D. 2007).\n\n       Here, more than one of these grounds was implicated by Appellant\u2019s escape while on\n\nprobation. First, because he absconded for well over a year, \u201cdeciding his appeal on the merits\n\nwould tend to diminish respect for our appellate courts.\u201d Id. (citing Pradt, 219 S.W.3d at 862).\n\nSecond, dismissing Appellant\u2019s appeal \u201cpursuant to the escape rule would discourage escape,\n\nprevent selectively abiding by court\u2019s decisions, encourage voluntary surrender and preserve\n\nrespect for the criminal justice system.\u201d Id. Third, because he absconded while on probation,\n\nAppellant showed \u201c. . . contempt for the very system of justice that granted him probation in lieu\n\nof incarceration.\u201d Id., quoting Hicks v. State, 824 S.W.2d 132, 134 (Mo. App. S.D. 1992)\n\n(internal quotations omitted); see also Wartenbe v. State, 583 S.W.3d 115, 123 (Mo. App. E.D.\n\n2019) (\u201cThis Court repeatedly has found that absconding after violating the terms of probation\n\ndemonstrates the requisite contempt for the judicial process justifying dismissal of the\n\nabsconder\u2019s claims under the escape rule.\u201d).\n\n       In short, Appellant showed he was unwilling to abide by the rules of the legal system, and\n\nhe flouted the authority of the courts from which he now seeks post-conviction relief. See id. As\n\nthe trial court observed, Appellant \u201cthumbed [his] nose\u201d at the court and required the expenditure\n\nof \u201ca lot of effort to get [him] back\u201d before the court. As a result, we use our discretion to deny\n\nreview of Appellant\u2019s Points I and II on appeal.\n\n                                               Point III\n\n       Appellant claims the motion court clearly erred in denying his Rule 24.035 motion\n\nbecause he was denied his rights to effective assistance of counsel and due process of law in that\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fprobation revocation counsel failed to advocate that Appellant\u2019s conviction should be amended\n\nto misdemeanor stealing and he should be sentenced to no more than one year\u2019s incarceration, in\n\nthat the offense of which he was convicted was actually a misdemeanor, according to the\n\nMissouri Supreme Court in State v. Bazell. Appellant claims but for probation revocation\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to advocate, there is a reasonable probability the trial court would have reduced\n\nhis felony stealing conviction to a misdemeanor, and would have sentenced him to no more than\n\none year\u2019s incarceration.\n\n       \u201cWe review a denial of a post-conviction motion for whether the motion court\u2019s findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.\u201d Whittley v. State, 559 S.W.3d 401, 402\u2013\n\n03 (Mo. App. E.D. 2018), citing Rule 24.035(k). \u201cA judgment is clearly erroneous only if this\n\nCourt is \u2018left with a definite and firm impression that a mistake has been made.\u2019\u201d Meiners v.\n\nState, 540 S.W.3d 832, 836 (Mo. banc 2018), quoting Mallow v. State, 439 S.W.3d 764, 768\n\n(Mo. banc 2014). \u201cWe affirm the motion court\u2019s judgment if it reached the right result, even if\n\nfor the wrong reason.\u201d Curry v. State, 438 S.W.3d 523, 524 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014), citing\n\nBranson v. State, 145 S.W.3d 57, 58 (Mo. App. S.D. 2004).\n\n       \u201cA movant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing only where: (1) he pleads facts, not\n\nconclusions warranting relief; (2) the facts alleged are not refuted by the record; and (3) the\n\nmatters complained of resulted in prejudice to him. Whittley, 559 S.W.3d at 403, citing Little v.\n\nState, 427 S.W.3d 846, 850 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014).\n\n       \u201cOn a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a movant must show by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and second, that the movant was\n\nprejudiced thereby.\u201d Curry v. State, 438 S.W.3d 523, 525 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014), citing\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). \u201cA movant must overcome the strong\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fpresumption defense counsel\u2019s conduct was reasonable and effective.\u201d McIntosh v. State, 413\n\nS.W.3d 320, 324 (Mo. banc 2013). \u201cTo overcome this presumption, a movant must identify\n\n\u2018specific acts or omissions of counsel that, in light of all the circumstances, fell outside the wide\n\nrange of professional competent assistance.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting Zink v. State, 278 S.W.3d 170, 176\n\n(Mo. banc 2009). \u201cIn evaluating an attorney\u2019s performance, this Court must \u2018eliminate the\n\ndistorting effects of hindsight ... [and] evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the\n\ntime.\u2019\u201d Meiners, 540 S.W.3d at 836, quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s amended motion included only the following facts in regard to this point:\n\n       After [Appellant] waived his right to a probation-violation hearing, his probation\n       had been revoked, and the court was contemplating the sentencing disposition,\n       counsel did not advocate for [Appellant\u2019s] felony-stealing conviction to be\n       reduced to a misdemeanor, and [Appellant] sentenced to no more than one year\u2019s\n       imprisonment, because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Bazell. The\n       court sentenced [Appellant] to five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s claim that probation revocation counsel was ineffective required him to first\n\novercome the presumption that probation revocation counsel was effective by identifying the acts\n\nor omissions outside of the range of professional competence. Here, Appellant claims the act\n\nthat rendered his probation revocation counsel ineffective was his failure to advocate that\n\nAppellant\u2019s felony conviction should be amended to misdemeanor stealing. However, at the\n\ntime of the hearing, the Missouri Supreme Court had decided State ex rel. Windeknecht v.\n\nMesmer, 530 S.W.3d 500, 503 (Mo. banc 2017), which holds that defendants who \u201creceived a\n\nsentence that was authorized by a different interpretation of section 570.030 without objection \u2026\n\nshould not receive the benefit of retroactive application of this Court\u2019s decision in Bazell.\u201d\n\n       Here, Appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2015. When his probation was\n\nrevoked, the court imposed the previously ordered sentence. Because Windeknecht held that\n\ndefendants should not receive the benefit of retroactive application of Bazell and \u201ccounsel\u2019s\n\n                                                  8\n\fconduct is measured by the law in effect at the time, and we do not generally require counsel to\n\nanticipate changes in the law,\u201d May v. State, 558 S.W.3d 122, 125 (Mo. App. S.D. 2018),\n\nAppellant failed to allege facts in his amended motion entitling him to relief. Point III is denied.\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n        Appellant\u2019s Points I and II are dismissed. The motion court\u2019s judgment is affirmed as to\n\nPoint III.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      SHERRI B. SULLIVAN, J.\n\nMary K. Hoff, P.J., and\nAngela T.
