            "opinion_text": "\nJUSTICE HOOD delivered the Opinion of the Court.\n\u00b61 After being charged with first degree murder as an adult in district court, Brandon Brown exercised his statutory right to request a \"reverse transfer\" to juvenile court. In doing so, he asks us to address whether he may temporarily waive privilege as to certain information at the reverse-transfer hearing without suffering a continued waiver at trial.1\n\u00b62 We hold that he may not. Nothing in the reverse-transfer statute gives Brown the ability to make such a limited waiver. And, neither common law scope-of-waiver limitations nor constitutional principles regarding impermissibly burdening rights change that result. By disclosing otherwise privileged information in open court during a reverse-transfer hearing, Brown would waive privilege as to any such information at trial. Because we agree with the trial court's ruling to the same effect, we discharge our rule to show cause.\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\u00b63 Brandon Brown was charged as an adult in district court for crimes alleged to have taken place in 2012, when he was seventeen *431years old. The district attorney charged Brown with one count of first degree murder, eight counts of attempted first degree murder, and one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery. Brown exercised his statutory right to seek a reverse transfer, a process that could result in his case being transferred from district court, where he would be tried as an adult, to juvenile court, where he would face prosecution under the Children's Code. See \u00a7 19-2-517(3)(a), C.R.S. (2018) (outlining the procedures for transferring a case from district court to juvenile court).\n\u00b64 Before the reverse-transfer hearing, however, Brown sought a protective order, requesting that the district court prohibit the prosecution from using at trial \"[a]ny evidence presented at the reverse-transfer hearing, and/or in briefs related to the issue of reverse-transfer.\" In addition to this wide-ranging request, Brown specifically singled out:\n\u2022 expert reports;\n\u2022 medical, dental, mental health, and/or psychological evaluations, screenings, or treatment, and any records underlying such evaluations or records upon which such evaluations are based;\n\u2022 school records;\n\u2022 Department of Human Services records;\n\u2022 records of dependency and neglect proceedings;\n\u2022 confidential records maintained by agencies of the judicial department or executive branch; and\n\u2022 any other confidential records.\n\u00b65 The district court denied the request for the protective order altogether. It found that it was \"unlikely that the type of evidence generally presented at a reverse transfer hearing would be relevant and admissible at a trial.\" But, in any event, it held that \"neither case law nor statute\" empowers a defendant at a reverse-transfer hearing to introduce privileged information without waiving privilege as to that information.\n\u00b66 We granted Brown's petition for a rule to show cause pursuant to C.A.R. 21. He argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to issue the protective order.\nII. Analysis\n\u00b67 We first address why jurisdiction is appropriate under C.A.R. 21. Because this is a question of first impression as to which a remedy on appeal could prove inadequate, we choose to exercise our original jurisdiction. Second, we identify the standard of review. Third, we analyze whether Brown can partially waive privilege during the reverse-transfer hearing. We conclude that any disclosure of privileged information at the reverse-transfer hearing would constitute a waiver at trial.\nA. Original Jurisdiction\n\u00b68 We generally hear petitions under C.A.R. 21 that \"raise issues of first impression\" and \"are of significant public importance.\" See People v. Johnson , 2016 CO 69, \u00b6 7, 381 P.3d 316, 318 (quoting People v. Steen , 2014 CO 9, \u00b6 8, 318 P.3d 487, 490 ). Additionally, we have discretion to exercise our original jurisdiction under C.A.R. 21 when \"a remedy on appeal would prove inadequate.\" Id. at \u00b6 8, 381 P.3d at 318 (quoting People v. Sisneros , 55 P.3d 797, 799 (Colo. 2002) ).\n\u00b69 All three considerations apply here. Whether a defendant may partially disclose privileged information in a reverse-transfer hearing is a question of first impression with significant public importance, and the issue is likely to recur. Additionally, as a practical matter, the wrongful disclosure of privileged information is irremediable on appeal, as the privileged information will have been disclosed. See Sisneros , 55 P.3d at 799.\n\u00b610 For all these reasons, we choose to exercise our original jurisdiction here.\nB. Standard of Review\n\u00b611 While we review a trial court's decision denying a protective order for abuse of discretion, Bond v. Dist. Court , 682 P.2d 33, 38 (Colo. 1984), we review questions of law, such as the interpretation of the reverse-transfer statute, de novo, *432Johnson , \u00b6 9, 381 P.3d at 318 (citing Bostelman v. People , 162 P.3d 686, 689 (Colo. 2007) ).\nC. Brown May Not Partially Waive Privilege\n\u00b612 Brown asserts privilege as to numerous documents, evaluations, and testimony by some witnesses. And although the parties disagree as to whether some of this correspondence and other evidence is privileged information, that level of the analysis is potentially rendered moot by another: Even if all that Brown seeks to protect is privileged, would he waive any such privilege upon disclosure of the information during a reverse-transfer hearing? To answer this question, we first turn to the language of the reverse-transfer statute.\n1. The Reverse-Transfer Statute\n\u00b613 The plain language of the statute doesn't explicitly give Brown the ability to make a limited waiver of privilege.\n\u00b614 The statute provides that \"[a]fter a juvenile case has been charged by direct filing ... in district court, the juvenile may file in district court a motion to transfer the case to juvenile court.\" \u00a7 19-2-517(3)(a). After describing some procedural requirements (time to file, responses by the district attorney, and so on), the statute lists factors for a court to consider \"[i]n determining whether the juvenile and the community would be better served by\" adjudicating in juvenile or district court. See \u00a7 19-2-517(3)(a)-(b).\n\u00b615 Among those factors are:\n\u2022 \"age ... and the maturity of the juvenile as determined by considerations of the juvenile's home, environment, emotional attitude, and pattern of living\";\n\u2022 \"record and previous history of the juvenile in prior court-related matters\";\n\u2022 \"current and past mental health status\";\n\u2022 \"likelihood of the juvenile's rehabilitation by use of the sentencing options available in the juvenile and district courts\"; and\n\u2022 \"previous[ ] commit[ment] to the department of human services.\"\n\u00a7 19-2-517(b)(IV), (V), (VI), (VII), (X).\n\u00b616 In interpreting a statute, we give words and phrases their plain and ordinary meaning, read them in context, and construe them according to the rules of grammar and common usage. See Doubleday v. People , 2016 CO 3, \u00b6 19, 364 P.3d 193, 196. Our primary task is to \"ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly.\" Turbyne v. People , 151 P.3d 563, 567 (Colo. 2007). Statutes should be applied as written, and we do not add or subtract words. See State v. Medved , 2019 CO 1, \u00b6 19, 433 P.3d 33, 37 (\"[I]n interpreting a statute, we must accept the General Assembly's choice of language and not add or imply words that simply are not there.\" (quoting People v. Diaz , 2015 CO 28, \u00b6 15, 347 P.3d 621, 625 )); see also Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 94 (2012) (\"[An] absent provision cannot be supplied by the courts.\").\n\u00b617 While the enumerated factors might implicate certain potentially privileged information (or at least confidential information), nowhere does the statute grant Brown the right to disclose that information solely for the purposes of reverse transfer. The statute is completely silent as to limited disclosure. And it isn't our role to add such language.2\n\u00b618 We therefore decline the invitation to effectively do so here.3\n2. Waiving Privilege Extends from the Reverse-Transfer Hearing to Trial\n\u00b619 Looking beyond the plain language of the statute, Brown argues that, as a *433matter of common law, waiver is \"limited to the purposes for which the information is placed at issue.\" That \"limited\" purpose here, he contends, is the reverse-transfer hearing. As a result, any disclosure must be confined to that hearing. We disagree.\n\u00b620 Both parties agree that privilege is waived when the \"privilege holder 'has injected his physical or mental condition into the case as the basis of a claim or an affirmative defense.' \" In re Alcon v. Spicer , 113 P.3d 735, 739 (Colo. 2005) (quoting Clark v. Dist. Court , 668 P.2d 3, 10 (Colo. 1983) ). However, Brown argues that \"as the basis of a claim or an affirmative defense\" means that he is only putting his physical and mental condition at issue with respect to the jurisdictional issue in the reverse-transfer hearing; he isn't simultaneously putting his physical and mental condition at issue as to the underlying alleged crimes. Brown emphasizes the language in Alcon that states that waivers \"have always been limited by the circumstances of the case.\" Id.\n\u00b621 But Alcon doesn't compel the result that Brown seeks. In Alcon , we noted that privilege holders only impliedly waive privilege as it relates to the specific condition that was placed at issue. Id. Alcon waived privilege \"with respect to the injuries claimed in her lawsuit,\" but not her entire medical record. Id. at 740. In other words, the scope of the information encompassed by Alcon's waiver of privilege was limited to the \"circumstances of the case\"-the types of injuries alleged and nothing else. Id. at 739. Once waived, however, the privileged information was waived for the purposes of the entire litigation; nothing about our analysis suggested that Alcon's waiver could be limited to a particular hearing or part of the litigation.\n\u00b622 Brown's reliance on our recent decision in Zapata v. People is equally misplaced. We held in Zapata that waiver under section 16-8.5-104, C.R.S. (2018) (addressing waiver of privilege in the competency context) is limited to the \"parties and the court in that defendant 's case.\" Zapata v. People , 2018 CO 82, \u00b6 41, 428 P.3d 517, 526-27. This holding does not apply here for at least three reasons. First, we came to our conclusion based on the specific statutory scheme at issue there, not on common law principles. Id. at \u00b6 44, 428 P.3d at 527 (\"[W]here, as here, the General Assembly has specified that only a limited waiver occurs, that-not a general common law principle-controls.\"). Second, the statute at issue in Zapata singled out-in five out of the six subsections-three recipients for disclosure. Id. at \u00b6 42, 428 P.3d at 527. Thus, the statute dictated limited waiver. Id. at \u00b6 45, 428 P.3d at 528. Third, even assuming that the analysis could somehow apply to the reverse-transfer statute, the defendant in Zapata was trying to gain access to medical records of another person from a different case. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 428 P.3d at 522. By contrast, Brown seeks to maintain his own privilege in the same case.\n\u00b623 Moreover, our decision in People v. Higgins undercuts Brown's argument regarding the scope of the waiver. There, a juvenile, through her defense counsel, agreed to a state-administered mental health assessment. People v. Higgins , 2016 CO 68, \u00b6 2, 383 P.3d 1167, 1168. Later, the district attorney dismissed the juvenile charges and charged the defendant as an adult. Id . at \u00b6 3, 383 P.3d at 1168. The defendant then requested a reverse-transfer hearing and sought to suppress the mental health assessment, arguing that the trial court was required to give Fifth Amendment self-incrimination warnings before the assessment. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10, 383 P.3d at 1168, 1169. But we declined to address that issue, concluding that, because the defendant consented to the assessment, there were no Fifth Amendment implications. Id. at \u00b6 11, 383 P.3d at 1169. In other words, the defendant had already waived her right to withhold that information, even though the assessment took place before the defendant's bid for reverse transfer. Thus, the reverse-transfer hearing and the underlying claims were all one \"case\" and any privilege waived in one applied to the other. So it is here as well.\n\u00b624 Therefore, our jurisprudence on waiver offers Brown no refuge.\n3. There's No Impermissible Burden on Constitutional Rights\n\u00b625 Brown also contends that refusing to grant a protective order impermissibly *434burdens his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But Brown isn't compelled to produce any privileged information and isn't punished for choosing not to. As a result, there isn't an impermissible burden on his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\u00b626 The thrust of Brown's argument is that his situation is the same as the defendant's in People v. Rosenthal . See 617 P.2d 551 (Colo. 1980). There, we held that \"unrestricted prosecutorial use at the guilt trial of the defendant's psychiatric communications clashes directly with the privilege against self-incrimination.\" Id. at 555. The defendant had hired her own psychiatrist to conduct an insanity evaluation in pursuit of a not guilty by reason of insanity plea. Id. at 552-53. Although there were statutory prohibitions on using information obtained from the state-mandated evaluation, there were no similar protections for a privately obtained evaluator. Id. at 553. Nevertheless, we reasoned that allowing use of the psychiatric communications with the private evaluator would require the defendant to \"become[ ] a witness against herself through the conduit of the psychiatric examiner.\" Id. at 555.\n\u00b627 But the reverse-transfer hearing and a not guilty by reason of insanity evaluation are apples to oranges. There is no requirement that a defendant provide explicit information about the alleged offense during a reverse-transfer hearing. See \u00a7 19-2-517(3)(a)-(b). Yet a sanity examination requires exactly that. The statutory definition of \"sanity examination\" says so: \"[A] court-ordered examination of a defendant ... directed to developing information to determining the sanity or insanity of the defendant at the time of the commission of the act with which he is charged.\" \u00a7 16-8-102(8), C.R.S. (2018) (emphasis added). So, in Rosenthal , the defendant was forced to \"become[ ] a witness against herself\" because she was required to speak about the offense itself. Rosenthal , 617 P.2d at 555. Brown is required to do no such thing, as we demonstrate below.4\n\u00b628 First, Johnson made clear that the reverse-transfer statute doesn't compel a defendant to produce any mental health records. Johnson , \u00b6 15, 381 P.3d at 319 (\"If privileged information is not 'made available' by the privilege-holder, nothing in the statute gives the trial court the power to force a party to disclose privileged information.\"). Thus, although Brown may submit privileged information at the reverse-transfer hearing, nothing forces him to do so. We have never held that being confronted with a choice-even a difficult one-regarding whether to waive privilege necessarily produces an unconstitutional burden.\n\u00b629 Second, while the reverse-transfer statute implicates potentially privileged information, it doesn't \"threaten[ ] to inflict 'potent sanctions' \" for failing to disclose such information. People v. Roberson , 2016 CO 36, \u00b6 31, 377 P.3d 1039, 1044 (quoting Lefkowitz v. Cunningham , 431 U.S. 801, 805, 97 S.Ct. 2132, 53 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977) ) (reasoning that the requirement to answer incriminating questions in order to maintain probation impermissibly burdened the defendant's constitutional rights). And because the reverse-transfer statute doesn't \"automatically penalize\" failure to disclose privileged information-as Johnson demonstrates-it doesn't impermissibly burden Brown's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. See People v. Sapp , 934 P.2d 1367, 1370 (Colo. 1997).\n\u00b630 In sum, because Brown isn't required to disclose any privileged information and is not penalized for declining to do so, the reverse-transfer statute doesn't impermissibly burden the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n*435III. Conclusion\n\u00b631 We acknowledge that Brown faces a difficult choice regarding whether to disclose privileged information during his reverse-transfer hearing. But that difficulty doesn't grant him the right to limit any resulting waiver to that hearing. (As the trial court noted, however, whether any disclosed information is admissible at trial is a different question.) While we understand that this uncertainty might hinder Brown and other similarly situated defendants from offering a full picture of their case during the reverse-transfer hearing, neither the reverse-transfer statute nor caselaw on waiver or impermissibly burdening constitutional rights supplies Brown with the remedy that he seeks. To the extent that this is a glitch in the statutory scheme, it is up to the General Assembly to decide whether to fix it.\n\u00b632 Therefore, we hold that Brown may not limit waiver to his reverse-transfer hearing. Accordingly, the trial court's order is affirmed.\nJUSTICE GABRIEL specially concurs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE COATS does not participate.\n\nBrown framed the issue as follows: \"Whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to issue a protective order preventing the prosecution from admitting[,] into trial evidence[,] confidential and privileged information Mr. Brown wishes to disclose for the sole purpose of supporting his motion for reverse-transfer.\"\n\n\nThe legislature has provided for limited waiver in other circumstances, such as insanity and competency. See \u00a7 16-8-107(1)(a), C.R.S. (2018); \u00a7 16-8.5-108, C.R.S. (2018). That the legislature has explicitly provided for limited waiver elsewhere but not in the reverse-transfer statute further suggests that the legislature didn't intend to create limited waiver here.\n\n\nBecause the plain and unambiguous language of the reverse-transfer statute resolves the issue of limited waiver, we need not reach for tools, such as legislative history, used to throw light on more enigmatic texts.\n\n\nBrown also relies on People v. Chavez for a similar proposition. See 621 P.2d 1362, 1365 (Colo. 1981). There we held that there was \"an intolerable tension\" between the right to testify in one's defense and the right against self-incrimination when it comes to the combination of a habitual criminal charge and a separate, substantive offense. Id. To properly defend against both charges, the defendant would be required to incriminate himself as to the habitual charge, which then could be used against him for the separate charges. Id. at 1364. In other words, the defendant had no choice. Brown has one.\n\n",

I write separately, however, to express my concern that the result that the law dictates, which I fear will deter many juvenile offenders who are charged as adults from seeking a reverse transfer of their cases, may not be what the legislature intended when it enacted the reverse-transfer statute.\n\u00b634 The reverse-transfer statute, section 19-2-517(3), C.R.S. (2018), is part of the Colorado Children's Code, sections 19-1-101 to 19-7-103, C.R.S. (2018). That Code provides, in pertinent part, that the purpose of the juvenile justice system is to hold public safety \"paramount\" while at the same time taking into consideration \"the best interests of the juvenile, the victim, and the community in providing appropriate treatment to reduce the rate of recidivism in the juvenile justice system and to assist the juvenile in becoming a productive member of society.\" \u00a7 19-2-102(1). Consistent with this purpose, the Code recognizes that, in certain circumstances, the juvenile and the community would be better served by having a juvenile offender tried in juvenile court, rather than as an adult in district court. See \u00a7 19-2-517(3). Such a view is also consistent with the Supreme Court's recognition that juvenile offenders are fundamentally different from adults for purposes of sentencing because (1) they lack maturity and have \"an underdeveloped sense of responsibility\"; (2) they \"are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure\"; and (3) their characters are \"not as well formed\" as those of adults. Roper v. Simmons , 543 U.S. 551, 569-70, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (quoting Johnson v. Texas , 509 U.S. 350, 367, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) ).\n\u00b635 Concluding that a juvenile waives privilege as to certain information that he or she wishes to present at a reverse-transfer hearing arguably undermines the foregoing principles because it potentially chills a juvenile offender's exercise of the right to seek a reverse transfer of his or her case in circumstances in which the juvenile and the community will be better served by adjudicatory proceedings in juvenile court.\n\u00b636 It is not clear to me that the legislature intended such a result, nor can I perceive a legitimate basis for chilling a juvenile offender's right to seek a reverse transfer in this way.\n\u00b637 Adopting a limited waiver of privilege in the present context will not prejudice the People because they will receive the information at issue in advance of the reverse-transfer hearing so that they will be able to prepare properly. Moreover, as everyone in this case appears to concede, information of the type at issue is unlikely to be admissible at the trial on the merits. Accordingly, I find it difficult to discern the interests that the People are seeking to vindicate in arguing that Brown would waive any privileges that he possesses by introducing at a reverse-transfer *436hearing evidence that section 19-2-517(3)(b) essentially compels him to produce.\n\u00b638 For these reasons, although applicable law compels me to join the majority opinion, I respectfully urge the General Assembly to clarify whether it intended a waiver of privilege in the circumstances presented here and, if not, to enact legislation that establishes appropriate limits on any waiver of privilege resulting from a juvenile's presentation of statutorily mandated evidence at a reverse-transfer hearing.\n",

The court also concludes that this result\n\ndoes not impermissibly burden a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-\n\nincrimination.\n\n        Thus, the supreme court holds that, if a defendant discloses privileged\n\ninformation in open court during a reverse-transfer hearing, that defendant would\n\nwaive        privilege    as      to     any      such      information      at      trial.\n\f                     The Supreme Court of the State of Colorado\n                     2 East 14th Avenue \u2022 Denver, Colorado 80203\n\n                                         2019 CO 50\n\n                           Supreme Court Case No. 18SA237\n                        Original Proceeding Pursuant to C.A.R. 21\n            District Court, City and County of Denver, Case No. 17CR20001\n                            Honorable Kenneth M.

In doing so, he asks us to address whether he may temporarily waive privilege\n\nas to certain information at the reverse-transfer hearing without suffering a continued\n\nwaiver at trial.1\n\n\u00b62     We hold that he may not. Nothing in the reverse-transfer statute gives Brown\n\nthe ability to make such a limited waiver. And, neither common law scope-of-waiver\n\nlimitations nor constitutional principles regarding impermissibly burdening rights\n\nchanges that result.   By disclosing otherwise privileged information in open court\n\nduring a reverse-transfer hearing, Brown would waive privilege as to any such\n\ninformation at trial. Because we agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling to the same effect, we\n\ndischarge our rule to show cause.\n\n                           I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n\u00b63     Brandon Brown was charged as an adult in district court for crimes alleged to\n\nhave taken place in 2012, when he was seventeen years old. The district attorney\n\ncharged Brown with one count of first degree murder, eight counts of attempted first\n\ndegree murder, and one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery. Brown\n\n\n\n\n1 Brown framed the issue as follows: \u201cWhether the district court abused its discretion by\nrefusing to issue a protective order preventing the prosecution from admitting[,] into\ntrial evidence[,] confidential and privileged information Mr. Brown wishes to disclose\nfor the sole purpose of supporting his motion for reverse-transfer.\u201d\n\n\n                                            2\n\fexercised his statutory right to seek a reverse transfer, a process that could result in his\n\ncase being transferred from district court, where he would be tried as an adult, to\n\njuvenile court, where he would face prosecution under the Children\u2019s Code. See \u00a7 19-2-\n\n517(3)(a), C.R.S. (2018) (outlining the procedures for transferring a case from district\n\ncourt to juvenile court).\n\n\u00b64     Before the reverse-transfer hearing, however, Brown sought a protective order,\n\nrequesting that the district court prohibit the prosecution from using at trial \u201c[a]ny\n\nevidence presented at the reverse-transfer hearing, and/or in briefs related to the issue\n\nof reverse-transfer.\u201d   In addition to this wide-ranging request, Brown specifically\n\nsingled out:\n\n       \uf0b7   expert reports;\n\n       \uf0b7   medical, dental, mental health, and/or psychological evaluations, screenings,\n           or treatment, and any records underlying such evaluations or records upon\n           which such evaluations are based;\n\n       \uf0b7   school records;\n\n       \uf0b7   Department of Human Services records;\n\n       \uf0b7   records of dependency and neglect proceedings;\n\n       \uf0b7   confidential records maintained by agencies of the judicial department or\n           executive branch; and\n\n       \uf0b7   any other confidential records.\n\n\u00b65     The district court denied the request for the protective order altogether. It found\n\nthat it was \u201cunlikely that the type of evidence generally presented at a reverse transfer\n\nhearing would be relevant and admissible at a trial.\u201d But, in any event, it held that\n\n\n                                             3\n\f\u201cneither case law nor statute\u201d empowers a defendant at a reverse-transfer hearing to\n\nintroduce privileged information without waiving privilege as to that information.\n\n\u00b66       We granted Brown\u2019s petition for a rule to show cause pursuant to C.A.R. 21. He\n\nargues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to issue the protective\n\norder.\n\n                                       II. Analysis\n\n\u00b67       We first address why jurisdiction is appropriate under C.A.R. 21. Because this is\n\na question of first impression as to which a remedy on appeal could prove inadequate,\n\nwe choose to exercise our original jurisdiction. Second, we identify the standard of\n\nreview. Third, we analyze whether Brown can partially waive privilege during the\n\nreverse-transfer hearing. We conclude that any disclosure of privileged information at\n\nthe reverse-transfer hearing would constitute a waiver at trial.\n\n                                A. Original Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b68       We generally hear petitions under C.A.R. 21 that \u201craise issues of first\n\nimpression\u201d and \u201care of significant public importance.\u201d See People v. Johnson, 2016 CO\n\n69, \u00b6 7, 381 P.3d 316, 318 (quoting People v. Steen, 2014 CO 9, \u00b6 8, 318 P.3d 487, 490).\n\nAdditionally, we have discretion to exercise our original jurisdiction under C.A.R. 21\n\nwhen \u201ca remedy on appeal would prove inadequate.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8, 381 P.3d at 318\n\n(quoting People v. Sisneros, 55 P.3d 797, 799 (Colo. 2002)).\n\n\u00b69       All three considerations apply here. Whether a defendant may partially disclose\n\nprivileged information in a reverse-transfer hearing is a question of first impression\n\n\n                                              4\n\fwith significant public importance, and the issue is likely to recur. Additionally, as a\n\npractical matter, the wrongful disclosure of privileged information is irremediable on\n\nappeal, as the privileged information will have been disclosed. See Sisneros, 55 P.3d at\n\n799.\n\n\u00b610    For all these reasons, we choose to exercise our original jurisdiction here.\n\n                                 B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b611    While we review a trial court\u2019s decision denying a protective order for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, Bond v. Dist. Court, 682 P.2d 33, 38 (Colo. 1984), we review questions of law,\n\nsuch as the interpretation of the reverse-transfer statute, de novo, Johnson, \u00b6 9,\n\n381 P.3d at 318 (citing Bostelman v. People, 162 P.3d 686, 689 (Colo. 2007)).\n\n                    C. Brown May Not Partially Waive Privilege\n\n\u00b612    Brown asserts privilege as to numerous documents, evaluations, and testimony\n\nby some witnesses. And although the parties disagree as to whether some of this\n\ncorrespondence and other evidence is privileged information, that level of the analysis\n\nis potentially rendered moot by another: Even if all that Brown seeks to protect is\n\nprivileged, would he waive any such privilege upon disclosure of the information\n\nduring a reverse-transfer hearing?       To answer this question, we first turn to the\n\nlanguage of the reverse-transfer statute.\n\n                           1. The Reverse-Transfer Statute\n\n\u00b613    The plain language of the statute doesn\u2019t explicitly give Brown the ability to\n\nmake a limited waiver of privilege.\n\n\n                                              5\n\f\u00b614     The statute provides that \u201c[a]fter a juvenile case has been charged by direct filing\n\n. . . in district court, the juvenile may file in district court a motion to transfer the case to\n\njuvenile court.\u201d \u00a7 19-2-517(3)(a). After describing some procedural requirements (time\n\nto file, responses by the district attorney, and so on), the statute lists factors for a court\n\nto consider \u201c[i]n determining whether the juvenile and the community would be better\n\nserved by\u201d adjudicating in juvenile or district court. See \u00a7 19-2-517(3)(a)\u2013(b).\n\n\u00b615     Among those factors are:\n\n        \uf0b7   \u201cage . . . and the maturity of the juvenile as determined by considerations of\n            the juvenile\u2019s home, environment, emotional attitude, and pattern of living\u201d;\n\n        \uf0b7   \u201crecord and previous history of the juvenile in prior court-related matters\u201d;\n\n        \uf0b7   \u201ccurrent and past mental health status\u201d;\n\n        \uf0b7   \u201clikelihood of the juvenile\u2019s rehabilitation by use of the sentencing options\n            available in the juvenile and district courts\u201d; and\n\n        \uf0b7   \u201cprevious[] commit[ment] to the department of human services.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 19-2-517(b)(IV), (V), (VI), (VII), (X).\n\n\u00b616     In interpreting a statute, we give words and phrases their plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning, read them in context, and construe them according to the rules of grammar\n\nand common usage. See Doubleday v. People, 2016 CO 3, \u00b6 19, 364 P.3d 193, 196. Our\n\nprimary task is to \u201cascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly.\u201d\n\nTurbyne v. People, 151 P.3d 563, 567 (Colo. 2007). Statutes should be applied as written,\n\nand we do not add or subtract words. See State v. Medved, 2019 CO 1, \u00b6 19, 433 P.3d 33,\n\n37    (\u201c[I]n interpreting a statute, we must accept the General Assembly\u2019s choice of\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\flanguage and not add or imply words that simply are not there.\u201d (quoting People v.\n\nDiaz, 2015 CO 28, \u00b6 15, 347 P.3d 621, 625)); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner,\n\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 94 (2012) (\u201c[An] absent provision cannot be\n\nsupplied by the courts.\u201d).\n\n\u00b617    While the enumerated factors might implicate certain potentially privileged\n\ninformation (or at least confidential information), nowhere does the statute grant Brown\n\nthe right to disclose that information solely for the purposes of reverse transfer. The\n\nstatute is completely silent as to limited disclosure. And it isn\u2019t our role to add such\n\nlanguage.2\n\n\u00b618   We therefore decline the invitation to effectively do so here.3\n\n             2. Waiving Privilege Extends from the Reverse-Transfer\n                                Hearing to Trial\n\n\u00b619   Looking beyond the plain language of the statute, Brown argues that, as a matter\n\nof common law, waiver is \u201climited to the purposes for which the information is placed\n\n\n\n\n2 The legislature has provided for limited waiver in other circumstances, such as\ninsanity and competency. See \u00a7 16-8-107(1)(a), C.R.S. (2018); \u00a7 16-8.5-108, C.R.S. (2018).\nThat the legislature has explicitly provided for limited waiver elsewhere but not in the\nreverse-transfer statute further suggests that the legislature didn\u2019t intend to create\nlimited waiver here.\n3 Because the plain and unambiguous language of the reverse-transfer statute resolves\nthe issue of limited waiver, we need not reach for tools, such as legislative history, used\nto throw light on more enigmatic texts.\n\n\n                                            7\n\fat issue.\u201d That \u201climited\u201d purpose here, he contends, is the reverse-transfer hearing. As\n\na result, any disclosure must be confined to that hearing. We disagree.\n\n\u00b620    Both parties agree that privilege is waived when the \u201cprivilege holder \u2018has\n\ninjected his physical or mental condition into the case as the basis of a claim or an\n\naffirmative defense.\u2019\u201d In re Alcon v. Spicer, 113 P.3d 735, 739 (Colo. 2005) (quoting Clark\n\nv. Dist. Court, 668 P.2d 3, 10 (Colo. 1983)). However, Brown argues that \u201cas the basis of\n\na claim or an affirmative defense\u201d means that he is only putting his physical and mental\n\ncondition at issue with respect to the jurisdictional issue in the reverse-transfer hearing;\n\nhe isn\u2019t simultaneously putting his physical and mental condition at issue as to the\n\nunderlying alleged crimes. Brown emphasizes the language in Alcon that states that\n\nwaivers \u201chave always been limited by the circumstances of the case.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b621    But Alcon doesn\u2019t compel the result that Brown seeks. In Alcon, we noted that\n\nprivilege holders only impliedly waive privilege as it relates to the specific condition\n\nthat was placed at issue. Id. Alcon waived privilege \u201cwith respect to the injuries\n\nclaimed in her lawsuit,\u201d but not her entire medical record. Id. at 740. In other words,\n\nthe scope of the information encompassed by Alcon\u2019s waiver of privilege was limited to\n\nthe \u201ccircumstances of the case\u201d\u2014the types of injuries alleged and nothing else. Id. at\n\n739. Once waived, however, the privileged information was waived for the purposes of\n\nthe entire litigation; nothing about our analysis suggested that Alcon\u2019s waiver could be\n\nlimited to a particular hearing or part of the litigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f\u00b622   Brown\u2019s reliance on our recent decision in Zapata v. People is equally misplaced.\n\nWe held in Zapata that waiver under section 16-8.5-104, C.R.S. (2018) (addressing waiver\n\nof privilege in the competency context) is limited to the \u201cparties and the court in that\n\ndefendant\u2019s case.\u201d Zapata v. People, 2018 CO 82, \u00b6 41, 428 P.3d 517, 526\u201327. This holding\n\ndoes not apply here for at least three reasons. First, we came to our conclusion based on\n\nthe specific statutory scheme at issue there, not on common law principles. Id. at \u00b6 44,\n\n428 P.3d at 527 (\u201c[W]here, as here, the General Assembly has specified that only a\n\nlimited waiver occurs, that\u2014not a general common law principle\u2014controls.\u201d). Second,\n\nthe statute at issue in Zapata singled out\u2014in five out of the six subsections\u2014three\n\nrecipients for disclosure. Id. at \u00b6 42, 428 P.3d at 527. Thus, the statute dictated limited\n\nwaiver. Id. at \u00b6 45, 428 P.3d at 528. Third, even assuming that the analysis could\n\nsomehow apply to the reverse-transfer statute, the defendant in Zapata was trying to\n\ngain access to medical records of another person from a different case. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 11\u201312,\n\n428 P.3d at 522. By contrast, Brown seeks to maintain his own privilege in the same case.\n\n\u00b623   Moreover, our decision in People v. Higgins undercuts Brown\u2019s argument\n\nregarding the scope of the waiver. There, a juvenile, through her defense counsel,\n\nagreed to a state-administered mental health assessment. People v. Higgins, 2016 CO 68,\n\n\u00b6 2, 383 P.3d 1167, 1168. Later, the district attorney dismissed the juvenile charges and\n\ncharged the defendant as an adult. Id. at \u00b6 3, 383 P.3d at 1168. The defendant then\n\nrequested a reverse-transfer hearing and sought to suppress the mental health\n\nassessment, arguing that the trial court was required to give Fifth Amendment\n\n\n                                            9\n\fself-incrimination warnings before the assessment. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10, 383 P.3d at 1168,\n\n1169. But we declined to address that issue, concluding that, because the defendant\n\nconsented to the assessment, there were no Fifth Amendment implications. Id. at \u00b6 11,\n\n383 P.3d at 1169. In other words, the defendant had already waived her right to\n\nwithhold that information, even though the assessment took place before the\n\ndefendant\u2019s bid for reverse transfer.    Thus, the reverse-transfer hearing and the\n\nunderlying claims were all one \u201ccase\u201d and any privilege waived in one applied to the\n\nother. So it is here as well.\n\n\u00b624    Therefore, our jurisprudence on waiver offers Brown no refuge.\n\n          3. There\u2019s No Impermissible Burden on Constitutional Rights\n\n\u00b625    Brown also contends that refusing to grant a protective order impermissibly\n\nburdens his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.           But Brown isn\u2019t\n\ncompelled to produce any privileged information and isn\u2019t punished for choosing not\n\nto. As a result, there isn\u2019t an impermissible burden on his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n\u00b626    The thrust of Brown\u2019s argument is that his situation is the same as the\n\ndefendant\u2019s in People v. Rosenthal. See 617 P.2d 551 (Colo. 1980). There, we held that\n\n\u201cunrestricted prosecutorial use at the guilt trial of the defendant\u2019s psychiatric\n\ncommunications clashes directly with the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Id. at\n\n555. The defendant had hired her own psychiatrist to conduct an insanity evaluation in\n\npursuit of a not guilty by reason of insanity plea. Id. at 552\u201353. Although there were\n\nstatutory prohibitions on using information obtained from the state-mandated\n\n\n                                          10\n\fevaluation, there were no similar protections for a privately obtained evaluator. Id. at\n\n553. Nevertheless, we reasoned that allowing use of the psychiatric communications\n\nwith the private evaluator would require the defendant to \u201cbecome[] a witness against\n\nherself through the conduit of the psychiatric examiner.\u201d Id. at 555.\n\n\u00b627   But the reverse-transfer hearing and a not guilty by reason of insanity evaluation\n\nare apples to oranges.    There is no requirement that a defendant provide explicit\n\ninformation   about    the   alleged   offense   during    a   reverse-transfer   hearing.\n\nSee \u00a7 19-2-517(3)(a)-(b). Yet a sanity examination requires exactly that. The statutory\n\ndefinition of \u201csanity examination\u201d says so: \u201c[A] court-ordered examination of a\n\ndefendant . . . directed to developing information to determining the sanity or insanity\n\nof the defendant at the time of the commission of the act with which he is charged.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 16-8-102(8), C.R.S. (2018) (emphasis added). So, in Rosenthal, the defendant was forced\n\nto \u201cbecome[] a witness against herself\u201d because she was required to speak about the\n\noffense itself. Rosenthal, 617 P.2d at 555. Brown is required to do no such thing, as we\n\ndemonstrate below.4\n\n\n\n\n4 Brown also relies on People v. Chavez for a similar proposition. See 620 P.2d 1362, 1365\n(Colo. 1981). There we held that there was \u201can intolerable tension\u201d between the right to\ntestify in one\u2019s defense and the right against self-incrimination when it comes to the\ncombination of a habitual criminal charge and a separate, substantive offense. Id. To\nproperly defend against both charges, the defendant would be required to incriminate\nhimself as to the habitual charge, which then could be used against him for the separate\ncharges. Id. at 1364. In other words, the defendant had no choice. Brown has one.\n\n\n                                            11\n\f\u00b628    First, Johnson made clear that the reverse-transfer statute doesn\u2019t compel a\n\ndefendant to produce any mental health records. Johnson, \u00b6 15, 381 P.3d at 319 (\u201cIf\n\nprivileged information is not \u2018made available\u2019 by the privilege-holder, nothing in the\n\nstatute gives the trial court the power to force a party to disclose privileged\n\ninformation.\u201d).   Thus, although Brown may submit privileged information at the\n\nreverse-transfer hearing, nothing forces him to do so. We have never held that being\n\nconfronted with a choice\u2014even a difficult one\u2014regarding whether to waive privilege\n\nnecessarily produces an unconstitutional burden.\n\n\u00b629    Second, while the reverse-transfer statute implicates potentially privileged\n\ninformation, it doesn\u2019t \u201cthreaten[] to inflict \u2018potent sanctions\u2019\u201d for failing to disclose\n\nsuch information. People v. Roberson, 2016 CO 36, \u00b6 31, 377 P.3d 1039, 1044 (quoting\n\nLefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 805 (1977)) (reasoning that the requirement to\n\nanswer incriminating questions in order to maintain probation impermissibly burdened\n\nthe defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). And because the reverse-transfer statute doesn\u2019t\n\n\u201cautomatically penalize\u201d failure to disclose privileged information\u2014as Johnson\n\ndemonstrates\u2014it doesn\u2019t impermissibly burden Brown\u2019s Fifth Amendment right\n\nagainst self-incrimination. See People v. Sapp, 934 P.2d 1367, 1370 (Colo. 1997).\n\n\u00b630    In sum, because Brown isn\u2019t required to disclose any privileged information and\n\nis not penalized for declining to do so, the reverse-transfer statute doesn\u2019t\n\nimpermissibly burden the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f                                    III. Conclusion\n\n\u00b631    We acknowledge that Brown faces a difficult choice regarding whether to\n\ndisclose privileged information during his reverse-transfer hearing. But that difficulty\n\ndoesn\u2019t grant him the right to limit any resulting waiver to that hearing. (As the trial\n\ncourt noted, however, whether any disclosed information is admissible at trial is a\n\ndifferent question.) While we understand that this uncertainty might hinder Brown and\n\nother similarly situated defendants from offering a full picture of their case during the\n\nreverse-transfer hearing, neither the reverse-transfer statute nor caselaw on waiver or\n\nimpermissibly burdening constitutional rights supplies Brown with the remedy that he\n\nseeks. To the extent that this is a glitch in the statutory scheme, it is up to the General\n\nAssembly to decide whether to fix it.\n\n\u00b632    Therefore, we hold that Brown may not limit waiver to his reverse-transfer\n\nhearing. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.\n\nJUSTICE GABRIEL specially concurs.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fJUSTICE GABRIEL, specially concurring.\n\n\u00b633    I join the majority\u2019s opinion in full because I believe that the conclusion that it\n\nreaches is compelled by applicable statutory and case law. I write separately, however,\n\nto express my concern that the result that the law dictates, which I fear will deter many\n\njuvenile offenders who are charged as adults from seeking a reverse transfer of their\n\ncases, may not be what the legislature intended when it enacted the reverse-transfer\n\nstatute.\n\n\u00b634    The reverse-transfer statute, section 19-2-517(3), C.R.S. (2018), is part of the\n\nColorado Children\u2019s Code, sections 19-1-101 to 19-7-103, C.R.S. (2018).         That Code\n\nprovides, in pertinent part, that the purpose of the juvenile justice system is to hold\n\npublic safety \u201cparamount\u201d while at the same time taking into consideration \u201cthe best\n\ninterests of the juvenile, the victim, and the community in providing appropriate\n\ntreatment to reduce the rate of recidivism in the juvenile justice system and to assist the\n\njuvenile in becoming a productive member of society.\u201d \u00a7 19-2-102(1). Consistent with\n\nthis purpose, the Code recognizes that, in certain circumstances, the juvenile and the\n\ncommunity would be better served by having a juvenile offender tried in juvenile court,\n\nrather than as an adult in district court. See \u00a7 19-2-517(3). Such a view is also consistent\n\nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that juvenile offenders are fundamentally\n\ndifferent from adults for purposes of sentencing because (1) they lack maturity and\n\nhave \u201can underdeveloped sense of responsibility\u201d; (2) they \u201care more vulnerable or\n\nsusceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure\u201d; and\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f(3) their characters are \u201cnot as well formed\u201d as those of adults.         Roper v. Simmons,\n\n543 U.S. 551, 569\u201370 (2005) (quoting Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 367 (1993)).\n\n\u00b635    Concluding that a juvenile waives privilege as to certain information that he or\n\nshe wishes to present at a reverse-transfer hearing arguably undermines the foregoing\n\nprinciples because it potentially chills a juvenile offender\u2019s exercise of the right to seek a\n\nreverse transfer of his or her case in circumstances in which the juvenile and the\n\ncommunity will be better served by adjudicatory proceedings in juvenile court.\n\n\u00b636    It is not clear to me that the legislature intended such a result, nor can I perceive\n\na legitimate basis for chilling a juvenile offender\u2019s right to seek a reverse transfer in this\n\nway.\n\n\u00b637    Adopting a limited waiver of privilege in the present context will not prejudice\n\nthe People because they will receive the information at issue in advance of the\n\nreverse-transfer hearing so that they will be able to prepare properly. Moreover, as\n\neveryone in this case appears to concede, information of the type at issue is unlikely to\n\nbe admissible at the trial on the merits. Accordingly, I find it difficult to discern the\n\ninterests that the People are seeking to vindicate in arguing that Brown would waive\n\nany privileges that he possesses by introducing at a reverse-transfer hearing evidence\n\nthat section 19-2-517(3)(b) essentially compels him to produce.\n\n\u00b638    For these reasons, although applicable law compels me to join the majority\n\nopinion, I respectfully urge the General Assembly to clarify whether it intended a\n\nwaiver of privilege in the circumstances presented here and, if not, to enact legislation\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthat establishes appropriate limits on any waiver of privilege resulting from a juvenile\u2019s\n\npresentation of statutorily mandated evidence at a reverse-transfer hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f",
