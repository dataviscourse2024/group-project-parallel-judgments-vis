We grant the motion, withdraw our\r\nopinion and judgment dated January 12, 2006, and issue this opinion and judgment\r\nin their stead.  Although we have clarified some of our factual assertions, our\r\ndisposition of each of appellant\u2019s original points of error remains the same.  Given\r\nour disposition of appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing, appellant\u2019s motion for en banc\r\nconsideration on rehearing is denied as moot.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A jury convicted appellant, Felonta Conway Prince, of capital murder.  See\r\nTex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 19.03(a)(2) (Vernon Supp. 2005) (proscribing murders in\r\nthe course of, among other crimes, robbery).  The State had not sought the death\r\npenalty, and the trial court assessed punishment at life imprisonment.  See Act of\r\nMay 29, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 900, \u00a7 1.01, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3586, 3602\r\n(providing for automatic life imprisonment when State does not seek death\r\npenalty), amended by Act of May 28, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 787, \u00a7 1, 2005\r\nTex. Gen. Laws 2705, 2705 (current version at Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 12.31(a)\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2005)).  We determine (1) whether there is sufficient corroboration\r\nof accomplice-witness testimony to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction; (2) whether the\r\nevidence was legally and factually sufficient to show that appellant intentionally\r\ncommitted the murder of Ricardo Rodriguez in the course of committing a robbery;\r\nand (3) whether the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by suborning\r\nperjurious testimony.  We affirm.\r\nFacts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December of 2003, appellant enlisted Abraham Villagomez to help\r\nappellant carry out a rip-off of a drug dealer.  On December 27, 2003, appellant\r\narrived at Villagomez\u2019s apartment, where they planned the rip-off, sometime\r\nbetween 9:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  About an hour later, the complainant, Ricardo\r\nRodriguez, arrived.  Appellant struck the complainant in the head, causing him to\r\nfall face down on the floor.  Villagomez and appellant taped the complainant\u2019s\r\nhands and legs with duct tape that appellant had brought over earlier.  Then they\r\ncarried the complainant to Villagomez\u2019s Honda and placed him in the trunk.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Villagomez drove north on Loop 610 and entered the Hardy Toll Road. \r\nAppellant was in the front passenger seat.  They could hear the complainant\r\nstruggling in the trunk.  Appellant became angry, yelling at the complainant to\r\nstop.  Appellant then shot his .38 millimeter revolver three times through the back\r\nseat into the trunk.  After passing through a couple of toll booths, Villagomez\r\nexited and stopped in a U-turn underneath a bridge.  He and appellant opened the\r\ntrunk to find the complainant still alive.  Appellant then shot the complainant in the\r\nhead and told Villagomez to take him out.  Villagomez took the complainant out of\r\nthe trunk and placed him on the side of the curb.  Appellant and Villagomez then\r\ngot back in the Honda, appellant fired the rest of the rounds at the complainant, and\r\nthey drove off, \u201cburning rubber.\u201d  In addition to stealing the complainant\u2019s\r\ncocaine, appellant took the keys to the complainant\u2019s Infiniti, and Villagomez took\r\nthe complainant\u2019s shoes and money.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alva Wade Walker, a resident whose home backed up to the Hardy Toll\r\nRoad near the turnaround, heard two gunshots around 10:37 p.m.  At\r\napproximately 11:00 p.m., a furniture delivery man, Armando Martinez,\r\ndiscovered the body as he drove through the turnaround.  He called 911 from his\r\ncellular phone.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next morning, appellant enlisted 19-year-old Frederick Williams, who\r\nlived at the same apartment complex as Villagomez, to help remove the tires from\r\nthe complainant\u2019s Infiniti.  Williams observed appellant move Villagomez\u2019s Honda\r\nfrom one location in the complex parking lot to another location farther back. \r\nWilliams had previously seen appellant drive the Honda in the company of\r\nVillagomez.  Appellant told Williams that he had shot a person, taken his drugs\r\nand money, and kept his car.  According to Williams, appellant said that he had\r\nbeen a passenger when he turned around and fired twice at the person sitting in the\r\nback seat of the car, that he then moved the person to the trunk, and that he then\r\nfinished the person off with a shot to the head.  Williams observed two bullet holes\r\nin the back seat of the Honda.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 8:29 a.m. that morning, police officers responded to an auto-theft-in-progress call at the same apartments.  Houston Police Officer Merlie Brown\r\napproached appellant and Williams, who were standing near the complainant\u2019s\r\nInfiniti.  The two appeared to be removing the tires from the Infiniti.  Appellant\r\nfled and escaped.  Williams told a deputy at the scene that appellant and\r\nVillagomez were often together.  Arrest warrants were obtained for Villagomez\r\nand appellant.  When Villagomez was arrested, he admitted his participation in the\r\nmurder of the complainant.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The deputy who processed the Honda found bullet holes in the back seat and\r\nblood in the trunk.  The deputy medical examiner who conducted the autopsy\r\nfound wounds consistent with the complainant\u2019s having been shot through the back\r\nseat and then in the head.  The shot to the head produced a contact wound that was\r\nthe cause of death.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later, Shawn Carville, another person whom appellant had tried to enlist in\r\nremoving the tires from the complainant\u2019s Infiniti, gave a written statement, in\r\nwhich he said that appellant had admitted shooting a guy three times while the guy\r\nwas in the trunk, opening the trunk, and then shooting the guy in the head.  Carville\r\nalso testified at trial that Villagomez, a couple of times before Christmas, had\r\ndiscussed committing a murder rip, which Carville described as \u201csetting up a key,\r\nthe guy doesn\u2019t carry, you know, beat his ass, trunk him.\u201d\r\nAccomplice-Witness Corroboration\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his first point of error, appellant contends that there is insufficient\r\ncorroboration of accomplice-witness testimony to sustain his conviction. \r\nAppellant argues that the testimony of Williams was insufficient to tend to connect\r\nappellant to the crime because of inconsistencies between Williams\u2019s testimony\r\nand that of Villagomez, the investigating deputies, and the deputy medical\r\nexaminer.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 38.14 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the\r\ntestimony of an accomplice witness be corroborated by other evidence tending to\r\nconnect the defendant with the offense committed.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\r\nart. 38.14 (Vernon 2005).  Because Villagomez was charged by indictment with\r\nthe same offense, he was an accomplice witness as a matter of law, and the trial\r\ncourt instructed the jury that it must find his testimony corroborated by other\r\nevidence tending to connect appellant to the offense.  The test for corroboration is\r\nto eliminate from consideration the accomplice witness\u2019s testimony and then to\r\nexamine the other inculpatory evidence to see if it tends to connect the defendant to\r\nthe offense.  McDuff v. State, 939 S.W.2d 607, 612 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State points out several types of non-accomplice evidence that tend to\r\nconnect appellant to the offense: (1) admissions that appellant made to both\r\nWilliams and Shawn that he had shot a man in the same, unique way in which the\r\ncomplainant had been shot; (2) appellant\u2019s possession of the complainant\u2019s Infiniti\r\nshortly after the murder; and (3) appellant\u2019s recent use of the car used to commit\r\nthe offense.  We agree with the State as to the existence of these types of non-accomplice evidence.  We hold that any of this evidence would be sufficient in\r\nitself, but, in conjunction, that they overwhelmingly tend to connect appellant to\r\nthe capital murder of the complainant.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s first point of error.\r\nLegal and Factual Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his second point of error, appellant contends that the evidence is legally\r\nand factually insufficient to support his conviction.  \r\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standards of Review\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a legal-sufficiency review, we view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\r\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  King v.\r\nState, 29 S.W.3d 556, 562 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).  In reviewing a factual-sufficiency challenge, we ask \u201cwhether a neutral review of all the evidence, both\r\nfor and against the finding, demonstrates that the proof of guilt is so obviously\r\nweak as to undermine confidence in the jury\u2019s determination, or the proof of guilt,\r\nalthough adequate if taken alone, is greatly outweighed by contrary proof.\u201d \r\nJohnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 11 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).  The factual-sufficiency\r\nstandard \u201cacknowledges that evidence of guilt can \u2018preponderate\u2019 in favor of\r\nconviction but still be insufficient to prove the elements of the crime beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\u201d  Zuniga v. State, 144 S.W.3d 477, 485 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). \r\nUnder either type of sufficiency review, the appellate court should not substitute its\r\nown judgment for that of the fact finder.  Jones v. State, 944 S.W.2d 642, 648\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1996).  The fact finder is entitled to believe all, some, or none of\r\nany witness\u2019s testimony.  Sharp v. State, 707 S.W.2d 611, 614 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1986).B.Legal Sufficiency\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Appellant contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to show that he\r\nintentionally committed murder while committing or attempting to commit\r\nrobbery, making the following arguments in support: (1) there was no physical\r\nevidence supporting the allegation that the defendant killed the complainant; (2)\r\nthere was no physical evidence supporting the allegation that defendant robbed or\r\nintended to rob the complainant; (3) there was no evidence of the firearm used to\r\nmurder the complainant, and the actual murder weapon had not been determined;\r\nand (4) the prosecution did not scientifically ascertain whether Villagomez or the\r\ndefendant had fired a weapon recently, despite law enforcement\u2019s sizeable\r\nopportunity to do so.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A legal-sufficiency review considers the evidence in the light most favorable\r\nto the verdict.  When viewed in the appropriate light, the evidence, detailed earlier,\r\nshows that appellant planned to rob and to murder the complainant; that appellant\r\nenlisted Villagomez to help him; that appellant shot the complainant first through\r\nthe back seat of Villagomez\u2019s car, as the complainant lay bound by duct tape, and\r\nthen point blank in the head; and that appellant fled when police converged on him\r\nand Williams the next morning while they were removing the tires from the\r\ncomplainant\u2019s car.  We hold that a jury, viewing this evidence, could rationally\r\nhave concluded that appellant committed murder by the alleged means during the\r\ncourse of committing robbery of the complainant.  Appellant\u2019s arguments do not\r\nundermine this evidence because they are not based on evidence that is viewed in\r\nthe appropriate light.  Indeed, they are based on lack of evidence.  Therefore, we\r\nhold that the evidence is legally sufficient to support the verdict.\r\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Factual Sufficiency\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also in his second point of error, appellant argues that the evidence showing\r\nguilt is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence based on the\r\nfollowing: (1) Kahlil Ahmed, an employee at the One Dollar Bazaar Store on\r\nEdgebrook, testified that Carville had been in his store with two other individuals\r\nuntil 9:40 p.m. on the night of the murder;\r\n\r\n\r\n (2) Carville testified that he and\r\nappellant had been together at the One Dollar Bazaar Store at I-45 and Edgebrook\r\nand had returned to appellant\u2019s apartment complex at 10:00 p.m.; (3) Nancy\r\nDomiguez testified that her husband, the complainant, had left home between 9:45\r\np.m. and 10:00 p.m., heading North on I-45 to Gulf Bank Road; (4) Villagomez\r\ntestified that appellant arrived at his apartment at about 9:30 p.m., that the victim\r\narrived about one hour later, and that, upon arrival, it took appellant and him about\r\n15 to 20 minutes to put the victim into the trunk of appellant\u2019s vehicle; (5) Walker\r\ntestified that she heard gunshots at approximately 10:37 p.m.; (6) Martinez testified\r\nthat he discovered the body at approximately 11:00 p.m.; (7) Lewis Eakins testified\r\nthat the distance from appellant\u2019s apartment complex to the place of discovery was\r\n37 miles; and (8) it was physically impossible for appellant to have been present at\r\nboth the One Dollar Bazaar store on Edgebrook until 9:40 p.m. and at\r\nVillagomez\u2019s apartment at 9:30 p.m. and still to have shot the victim under the\r\noverpass at Hardy Toll Road at 10:37 p.m., so that his body could have been\r\ndiscovered at 11:00 p.m. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Much of appellant\u2019s challenge rests on the credibility of the defense\r\nwitnesses as to the precise times at which events happened and the alleged\r\nincredibility of the State\u2019s witnesses regarding the time of events.  However, the\r\nCourt of Criminal Appeals has instructed that, in conducting a factual-sufficiency\r\nreview, \u201c[t]he reviewing court should not substantially intrude upon the jury\u2019s role\r\nas the sole judge of the weight and credibility of witness testimony.\u201d  Ortiz v. State,\r\n93 S.W.3d 79, 88 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).  The jury simply may have disbelieved\r\nappellant\u2019s evidence, may also simply not have believed that all of the witnesses\u2019\r\nmemories were perfectly accurate regarding the time of events, or may instead\r\nhave believed the State\u2019s witnesses.  We will not intrude on the jury\u2019s role\r\nconcerning credibility in these circumstances.  Appellant invites this Court to\r\ndisregard the general rule concerning credibility stated above.  We decline to do so\r\nbecause, \u201c[a]s an intermediate appellate court, we must follow binding precedent\r\nof the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d  McKinney v. State, Nos. 01-03-00565-CR, 01-03-00734-CR, 01-03-00735-CR, 2005 WL 327145, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] Feb. 10, 2005, pet. granted).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that the evidence on which appellant relies does not so undermine\r\nthe evidence supporting guilt as to render the verdict clearly wrong or manifestly\r\nunjust.  Accordingly, we hold that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the\r\nverdict.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We overrule appellant\u2019s second point of error.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProsecutorial Misconduct\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his third point of error, appellant contends that the State engaged in\r\nprosecutorial misconduct.  Appellant alleges that one of the State\u2019s witnesses\r\ncommitted perjury during the trial on the merits, the prosecutor was aware of the\r\nperjured testimony, and the prosecutor did nothing to correct the false testimony. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A person commits aggravated perjury if, with intent to deceive and with\r\nknowledge of the statement\u2019s meaning, he or she makes a false statement under\r\noath in connection with an official proceeding and the false statement is material. \r\nTex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 37.02, 37.03, 37.04 (Vernon 2003).  A statement is\r\nmaterial if it could have affected the course or outcome of the official proceeding. \r\nId. \u00a7 37.04(a).  Testimony that could have affected the course of the proceeding is\r\nmaterial when such testimony, if believed by the finder of fact, bears directly on\r\nthe credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses.  Mitchell v. State, 608 S.W.2d 226, 228\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1980).  Materiality refers to statements having some substantial\r\npotential for obstructing justice and excludes utterly trivial falsifications.  Id.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, appellant argues that Williams\u2019s testimony concerning\r\nWilliams\u2019s never having touched the Infiniti\u2014as well as Williams\u2019s testimony that\r\nappellant carried a pistol; wore a cotton jacket; shot the complainant in the head,\r\nchest, and stomach; placed the body in an empty field; and covered it up with\r\nsticks and trees\u2014was perjured.   When trial counsel for appellant brought up the\r\nmatter during trial, the prosecutor did not recall any material variances, and trial\r\ncounsel for appellant twice asserted that he was not questioning the integrity of the\r\nprosecutor.  The trial court advised that these were matters concerning which trial\r\ncounsel could cross-examine the witness.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, trial counsel had already attempted to show that the witness varied\r\nhis description of the material of appellant\u2019s jacket from one videotaped statement\r\nto the next.  When confronted, however, the witness could not remember having\r\nsaid that the jacket was leather and testified in conformity to his videotaped\r\nstatement, in which he had said that the jacket was cotton.  Regarding the locations\r\nof the gunshot wounds, the witness did not purport to have been present to have\r\npersonally witnessed the wounds.  The same is true regarding covering up the body\r\nwith sticks and trees.  Appellant\u2019s brief on appeal does not explain how the\r\nwitness\u2019s having testified to observing appellant carrying a pistol constitutes\r\nperjury.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, appellant\u2019s brief does not explain how any inconsistency\r\nmentioned by appellant could have affected the course or outcome of the trial. \r\nCertainly, trial counsel\u2019s use of the inconsistencies in the witness\u2019s two videotaped\r\nstatements and the witness\u2019s testimony at trial was abundantly developed before\r\nthe jury, so that the jury could determine which, if any, version of the witness\u2019s\r\ntestimony was credible.  However, even if this Court or the jury had determined\r\nthat each portion of the witness\u2019s testimony of which complaint is made on appeal\r\nwas perjurious, appellant has not shown that it would have affected the ultimate\r\njudgment of the jury that appellant was guilty of capital murder.
