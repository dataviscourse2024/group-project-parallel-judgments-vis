We affirm.\n\n      In 1998, after pleading guilty to third-degree murder and robbery,\n\nAppellant was sentenced to an aggregate term of 30 to 60 years of\n\nimprisonment. This Court denied Appellant relief on direct appeal, and his\n\njudgment of sentence became final in 2000 after our Supreme Court denied\n\nhis petition for allowance of appeal. Commonwealth v. Pringle, 757 A.2d\n\n996 (Pa. Super. 2000) (unpublished memorandum), appeal denied, 760\n\nA.2d 853 (Pa. 2000).      Appellant subsequently filed various PCRA petitions\n\nwhich resulted in no relief.\n\n\n\n\n*Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S57041-16\n\n\n      Appellant filed the petition that is the subject of the instant appeal on\n\nDecember 17, 2015. Therein, he claimed that he is entitled to relief in the\n\nform of resentencing because his sentence is illegal under Alleyne v.\n\nUnited States, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (holding that a fact\n\nwhich triggers the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence is an\n\nelement of the crime and must, therefore, be determined beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt by a jury), and Commonwealth v. Hopkins, 117 A.3d\n\n247 (Pa. 2015) (applying Alleyne to hold that the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence found at 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317 (relating to drug activity in a school\n\nzone) is unconstitutional). PCRA Petition, 12/17/2015, at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5-7.\n\n      The PCRA court issued notice of its intent to dismiss the petition\n\nwithout a hearing, to which Appellant filed a response in opposition.       By\n\norder dated January 20, 2016, the PCRA court dismissed Appellant\u2019s petition.\n\nThis timely-filed appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, Appellant claims, inter alia, that the PCRA court erred in\n\nnot applying the Alleyne decision retroactively.      Appellant\u2019s Brief at 15.\n\nHowever, before we may address Appellant\u2019s substantive arguments, we\n\nmust determine whether his PCRA petition was filed timely.\n\n      The timeliness of a post-conviction petition is jurisdictional.     See,\n\ne.g., Commonwealth v. Lewis, 63 A.3d 1274, 1280-81 (Pa. Super. 2013)\n\n(quoting Commonwealth v. Chester, 895 A.2d 520, 522 (Pa. 2006)) (\u201c[I]f\n\na PCRA petition is untimely, neither this Court nor the [PCRA] court has\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-S57041-16\n\n\njurisdiction over the petition.     Without jurisdiction, we simply do not have\n\nthe legal authority to address the substantive claims.\u201d).\n\n      Generally, a petition for relief under the PCRA, including a second or\n\nsubsequent petition, must be filed within one year of the date the judgment\n\nof sentence is final unless the petition alleges, and the petitioner proves,\n\nthat an exception to the time for filing the petition is met, and that the claim\n\nwas raised within 60 days of the date on which it became available.              42\n\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)-(2).\n\n      It is clear that Appellant\u2019s 2015 petition is facially untimely: his\n\njudgment of sentence became final in 2000.             However, Appellant alleged\n\nthat his petition satisfied the following timeliness exception: \u201c\u2018the facts upon\n\nwhich the claim is predicated were unknown to the Petitioner and could not\n\nbe ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.\u2019\u201d                   PCRA Petition,\n\n12/17/2015,     at      1     (pages   unnumbered)        (quoting     42   Pa.C.S.\n\n\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii)).\n\n      \u201cOur Courts have expressly rejected the notion that judicial decisions\n\ncan   be   considered       newly-discovered   facts   which   would    invoke   the\n\nprotections afforded by section 9545(b)(1)(ii).\u201d               Commonwealth v.\n\nCintora, 69 A.3d 759, 763 (Pa. Super. 2013) (citing Commonwealth v.\n\nWatts, 23 A.3d 980, 986 (Pa. 2011)).\n\n      Nor does Appellant\u2019s reliance upon Hopkins satisfy the newly-\n\nrecognized-constitutional-right timeliness exception found at 42 Pa.C.S.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fJ-S57041-16\n\n\n\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(iii),   as   the    Hopkins      Court   did   not   recognize   a   new\n\nconstitutional right, let alone hold that any such right applied retroactively;\n\nrather, it merely applied Alleyne to hold that a particular mandatory\n\nminimum sentence not applied to Appellant was unconstitutional.               Indeed,\n\nour Supreme Court has held, in a case involving the statute pursuant to\n\nwhich Appellant was sentenced,1 that Alleyne itself does not apply\n\nretroactively   to   cases      on   collateral   review.     Commonwealth         v.\n\nWashington, -- A.3d --, 2016 WL 3909088 (Pa. July 19, 2016).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Appellant has failed to establish a timeliness\n\nexception to the PCRA\u2019s limitations.              Thus, the PCRA court properly\n\ndismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n      Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\nDate: 8/29/2016\n\n\n\n\n1\n  42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9712 (pertaining to mandatory minimum sentencing\nprovisions associated with the commission of certain crimes with a firearm).\n\n                                         -4-\n\f",
