On February 22, 2012, Defendant pled guilty to three counts of Robbery\n\nFirst Degree, Assault Second Degree, and Conspiracy Second Degree.1 By Order\n\ndated May 18, 2012,2 effective September 27, 2011, Defendant was sentenced as\n\nfollows: for Robbery First Degree \u2013 IN11-10-0352, 10 years at Level V, suspended\n\nafter 4 years, for 6 months at supervision Level IV DOC Discretion, hold at\n\nsupervision Level V until space is available at Level IV, followed by 18 months at\n\nsupervision Level III;3 for Robbery First Degree \u2013 IN11-10-0355, 10 years at Level\n\n\n\n1\n  D.I. 9.\n2\n  D.I. 19.\n3\n  The first 3 years of this sentence are mandatory pursuant to 11 Del. C. \u00a7 832(a).\n\fV, suspended after 3 years, for 2 year at supervision Level III; 4 for Robbery First\n\nDegree \u2013 IN11-10-0356, 10 years at Level V, suspended after 3 years, for 2 years at\n\nsupervision Level III;5 for Assault Second Degree, 8 years at Level V, suspended for\n\n2 years at supervisions Level III; and for Conspiracy Second Degree, 2 years at Level\n\nV, suspended for 1 year at supervision Level III. 6\n\n       2.      On April 24, 2020, Defendant filed the instant Motion, asking the Court\n\nto: (1) suspend the remaining Level V time on each of his Robbery First Degree\n\nsentences and add that time to his probation; (2) with regard to the sentence in IN11-\n\n10-0352, modify the hold level from supervision Level V to supervision Level III;\n\nand (3) upon release, transfer his probation to New Jersey or Pennsylvania.7 In\n\nsupport of his Motion, Defendant cites his potential risk of exposure to COVID-19,\n\nhis need to support his family, and his rehabilitative efforts. 8\n\n       3.      Superior Court Criminal Rule 35 governs motions for modification of\n\nsentence. \u201cUnder Rule 35(b), a motion for sentence modification must be filed\n\nwithin ninety days of sentencing, absent a showing of \u2018extraordinary\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The first 3 years of this sentence are mandatory pursuant to 11 Del. C. \u00a7 832(a).\n5\n  The first 3 years of this sentence are mandatory pursuant to 11 Del. C. \u00a7 832(a).\n6\n  Probation is concurrent.\n7\n  D.I. 29.\n8\n  Id.\n                                                 2\n\fcircumstances.\u2019\u201d9 The Court will not consider repetitive requests for reduction or\n\nmodification of sentence.10\n\n       4.      First, Defendant filed this Motion well beyond the 90-day limit, and\n\ntherefore the Motion is time-barred. The Court will consider an application made\n\nmore than 90 days after the imposition of sentence only in \u201cextraordinary\n\ncircumstances,\u201d or pursuant to 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217. Delaware law places a heavy\n\nburden on the moving party to establish extraordinary circumstances in order to\n\n\u201cuphold the finality of sentences.\u201d11 \u201cExtraordinary circumstances\u201d excusing an\n\nuntimely Rule 35(b) motion are circumstances that \u201cspecifically justify the delay,\n\nare entirely beyond a petitioner\u2019s control, and have prevented the applicant from\n\nseeking the remedy on a timely basis.\u201d 12 Mitigating factors that could have been\n\npresented at sentence, exemplary conduct or successful rehabilitation while\n\nincarcerated does not constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d 13 The Court does\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Croll v. State, 2020 WL 1909193, at *1 (Del. Apr. 17, 2020) (TABLE) (affirming the Superior\nCourt\u2019s denial of a motion for modification of sentence where the motion was repetitive and filed\nbeyond the 90-day limit); see Hewett v. State, 2014 WL 5020251, at *1 (Del. Oct. 7, 2014) (\u201cWhen\na motion for reduction of sentence is filed within ninety days of sentencing, the Superior Court has\nbroad discretion to decide whether to alter its judgment.\u201d).\n10\n   Super. Ct. Crim. R. 35(b).\n11\n   State v. Diaz, 2015 WL 1741768, at *2 (Del. Apr. 15, 2015).\n12\n   State v. Culp, 152 A.3d 141, 145 (Del. 2016) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Diaz, 2015\nWL 1741768, at *2).\n13\n    See id. at 145\u201346 (recognizing that participation in educational and rehabilitative prison\nprograms is commendable, but does not by itself constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d for\npurposes of Rule 35(b));\n                                                 3\n\fnot find the existence of any extraordinary circumstances in connection with\n\nDefendant\u2019s Motion.\n\n       5.     Second, this is Defendant\u2019s fifth request to modify his sentences under\n\nRule 35(b), and therefore, Defendant\u2019s Motion is barred as repetitive. 14\n\n       6.     Third, the Court has no authority to reduce or suspend the mandatory\n\nportion of any substantive minimum sentence.15 The first three years of Defendant\u2019s\n\nLevel V sentences for Robbery First Degree are mandatory and cannot be reduced\n\nor suspended. 16\n\n       7.     Last, the Court does not have authority to transfer Defendant\u2019s Level\n\nIII supervision to another jurisdiction.           The Interstate Commission for Adult\n\nOffender Supervision regulates the movement of probationers across state lines. 17\n\n       8.     The sentences are appropriate for all the reasons stated at the time of\n\nsentencing. No additional information has been provided to the Court that would\n\nwarrant a reduction or modification of these sentences.\n\n\n\n\n14\n   See D.I. 21, 23, 25, 27.\n15\n   State v. Sturgis, 947 A.2d 1087, 1092 (Del. 2008) (explaining that \u201cSuperior Court Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 35(b) provides no authority for a reduction or suspension of the mandatory\nportion of a substantive statutory minimum sentence.\u201d).\n16\n   See 11 Del.
