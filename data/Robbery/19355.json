They seek post conviction relief on the ground that their pleas were involuntary because they were not advised that they would be ineligible for parole if they received \"flat\" sentences instead of \"split\" sentences.\nUnder section 83-1, 110, R.S.Supp., 1969, the defendants are eligible for release on parole upon completion of their minimum terms less reductions, or upon completion of the minimum sentences provided by law less reductions if approved by the sentencing judge or his successor in office.\nThe judgment denying post conviction relief is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\n",
