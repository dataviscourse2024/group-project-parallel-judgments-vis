In a\n\nsingle issue, he contends the trial court abused its discretion in finding true the allegation that he\n\ncommitted solicitation of capital murder because there was legally insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport such a finding. We affirm.\n\n       In March 2013, appellant pleaded guilty to prescription fraud. As part of a plea bargain,\n\nthe trial court accepted appellant\u2019s plea but deferred a finding of guilty and placed appellant on\n\ncommunity supervision for three years. Two months later, the State filed a Petition to Enter\n\nFinal Adjudication of Defendant\u2019s Guilt. Among other things, the petition alleged appellant had\n\ncommitted solicitation of capital murder.\n\f       A hearing on the State\u2019s motion was held one month after the jury convicted appellant of\n\nthe solicitation of capital murder charge. The same judge presided over both the trial and\n\nrevocation proceeding, and appellant was represented by the same counsel at both proceedings.\n\nAt the hearing, appellant pleaded not true to the State\u2019s allegation. As evidence of the violation,\n\nthe prosecutor asked the trial judge to take judicial notice of the earlier proceeding in which\n\nappellant was convicted of solicitation of capital murder. The State noted the judge had presided\n\nover the proceedings, appellant had testified during the trial, and appellant had been convicted of\n\nthe new offense. The trial judge agreed to take judicial notice, and appellant did not object.\n\nThereafter, the judge found the allegation true, adjudicated appellant guilty, and assessed\n\npunishment.\n\n       On appeal, appellant complains there is insufficient evidence to support revocation of his\n\ncommunity supervision because the trial court revoked him based solely on the taking of judicial\n\nnotice of facts heard in a prior proceeding, which he contends is improper.\n\n       We review an appeal from a revocation of community supervision under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard. Hacker v. State, 389 S.W.3d 860, 865 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion in revoking community supervision if the State fails to prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that a violation of community supervision occurred. Id.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s exact complaint was previously rejected in Broussard v. State, 598 S.W.2d\n\n873 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980).       There, while on probation for burglary, the defendant was\n\nconvicted of aggravated robbery and delivery of methamphetamine. One of the conditions of his\n\nprobation was that he commit no other offense against the laws of this state. At the revocation\n\nhearing, the judge took notice of the evidence that he heard while presiding over appellant\u2019s trial\n\non the new offenses and revoked his probation. 598 S.W.2d at 874. On appeal, the defendant\n\nargued the evidence was insufficient to support probation revocation.\n\n                                               \u20132\u2013\n\f       In rejecting the complaint, the court explained it is \u201csufficient evidence, to support\n\nprobation revocation, that the judge took notice of the evidence that was introduced at a\n\nprobationer\u2019s trial before the same judge.\u201d Id. The court noted the appellate records of those\n\ntrials were before it to review.     Id.   Additionally, the court noted appellant forfeited any\n\ncomplaint about the propriety of the judge taking judicial notice by failing to object below.\n\n       Likewise, in this case, the same judge presided over the probation revocation proceeding\n\nand the criminal solicitation trial. On this date, this Court issued its opinion in the criminal\n\nsolicitation appeal, No. 05-14-00824-CR, concluding the evidence was legally and factually\n\nsufficient to support the rejection of appellant\u2019s affirmative defense of renunciation. Further,\n\nappellant has waived any complaint about the propriety of the court taking judicial notice by\n\nfailing to object. We overrule the sole issue.\n\n       We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       /Ada Brown/\n                                                       ADA BROWN\n                                                       JUSTICE\n\n\n\nDo Not Publish\nTEX.
