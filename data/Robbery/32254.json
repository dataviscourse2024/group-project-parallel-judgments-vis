Alley, Judge\n\n      Before Divison Three: Lisa White Hardwick, Presiding Judge, Gary D. Witt, Judge,\n                                Edward R. Ardini, Jr., Judge\n\n\n         Christopher Michael King (\"King\") appeals the judgment of the Circuit Court of\n\nHarrison County, Missouri (\"motion court\"), denying, without an evidentiary hearing, his\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 29.15. On appeal, King claims that the\n\nmotion court erred in: (1) denying, without an evidentiary hearing, King's claim that his\n\ntrial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a verdict directing instruction for the\n\nlesser-included offense of attempted assault in the second degree, because there is a\n\nreasonable probability that the jury would have convicted him on the lesser charge; (2)\n\fdenying, without an evidentiary hearing, King's claim that his trial counsel was ineffective\n\nin failing to object to the court's verdict directing instruction for attempted assault in the\n\nfirst degree under section 562.012; and (3) denying, without an evidentiary hearing, his\n\nclaim that the sentencing court was under the mistaken impression that King would not\n\nhave to serve 85 percent of his sentence. We affirm.\n\n                                Factual and Procedural Background1\n\n        In August 2017, M.T., an adult female, ended a nine-year, off-and-on romantic\n\nrelationship with King. After ending the relationship, M.T. and her daughter moved from\n\nCedar Rapids, Iowa, where they had been living with King, to her hometown of Cedar\n\nFalls, Iowa, approximately an hour away from Cedar Rapids.\n\n        A few weeks after their break-up, M.T. saw King's pick-up truck in Cedar Falls\n\nwhile she was dropping her daughter off at school. M.T. confronted King about following\n\nher. King agreed to go to a nearby McDonald's restaurant with M.T. so they could talk in\n\na public place. King was upset that their relationship had ended. While at McDonald's, he\n\nconfronted M.T. about her relationship with another man, who has since become M.T.'s\n\nhusband (\"Husband\"). M.T. met Husband in college and had previously been in a romantic\n\nrelationship with him. While talking to King, she denied she was in an ongoing relationship\n\nwith Husband. King grabbed M.T.'s phone from her purse and looked through her text\n\nmessages, confirming that M.T. had renewed her relationship with Husband. King then\n\ngot into the driver's seat of M.T.'s car to prevent her from leaving. Eventually, King got\n\n\n        1\n          Much of the factual background for King's underlying criminal case comes, without further attribution, from\nthe unpublished per curiam order denying King's direct appeal.\n\n                                                         2\n\fout of M.T.'s car and exclaimed to her, \"You're dead, you're all dead.\" M.T. was unable to\n\nmake any calls because her phone password was not being recognized.            Later that\n\nafternoon, M.T. reported this threat to the Cedar Falls police.\n\n       That weekend, M.T. convinced Husband, who lived in Mercer, Missouri, to stay\n\nwith her in Cedar Falls at her parents' house, where she had been staying. While Husband\n\nregularly spent the weekend with M.T. in Cedar Falls, M.T. wanted him to come up that\n\nweekend in particular because of the incident earlier in the week with King. That Sunday,\n\nSeptember 24, 2017, M.T. and the family returned home from church to find that several\n\nsmall items, including Husband's keys, had been moved, and a Rada-brand kitchen knife\n\nwas missing. M.T. was also unable to log into her computer because her password had\n\nbeen changed. King later admitted that he had been in Cedar Falls at the time, and a\n\nforensic examination of King's phone revealed photographs taken on September 24 of a\n\ncalendar on M.T.'s computer and a list of her passwords.\n\n       A few days later, on Tuesday, September 26, 2017, Husband returned to Mercer.\n\nHe spent the night at a neighbor's house directly across the street from his own house\n\nbecause he was uncomfortable staying at his home given the situation with King and the\n\nsuspicious circumstances at M.T.'s parents' home. When Husband went to his home to get\n\nsupplies, accompanied by his neighbor, he observed that items in the room used by M.T.'s\n\ndaughter appeared to be out of place. Husband set up a camcorder on a tripod at the\n\nneighbor's house to record the front door of his house. That night, the camera recorded\n\nKing unscrewing the front porch light bulb on Husband's house. Husband also spent the\n\nfollowing night at his neighbor's house.\n\n                                             3\n\f       On the morning of Thursday, September 28, 2017, Mercer County Deputy Sherriff\n\nJimmy See (\"Deputy See\") responded to a local park after a silver Toyota Camry associated\n\nwith King had been spotted in the park's parking lot. The vehicle was subject to a \"be on\n\nthe lookout\" or \"BOLO\" alert. When Deputy See arrived at the park, he found the vehicle\n\ncovered in heavy dew, but empty of occupants. Because Deputy See did not see anybody,\n\nhe left the park and went to Husband's home, less than one block away. As he was pulling\n\ninto Husband's driveway, a neighbor alerted him that the silver Camry was leaving the\n\npark. Deputy See initiated a traffic stop based on the BOLO alert and took King into\n\ncustody. Deputy See observed that King's clothing was wet or saturated on his front side\n\nand that his shoes were wet.\n\n       In his home, Husband discovered additional items in disarray, a plastic bag on the\n\nfloor under the bed where M.T.'s daughter slept when she stayed at the house, and a smiling\n\nface drawn in the dust on a speaker.\n\n       Deputy See found a screwdriver in King's front pocket and observed a brush axe or\n\nmachete and a black handled knife lying in plain view in the vehicle. At King's request,\n\nDeputy See retrieved a Subway bag located in the back seat of the vehicle. Deputy See\n\nfound that it contained approximately $10,000 cash, three savings bonds, and King's\n\npassport. King later admitted that he had purchased the Camry in Cedar Rapids. He\n\nclaimed that he happened to be in Mercer merely because he was driving through Mercer\n\nCounty on his way back to Iowa after visiting St. Louis.\n\n       After Deputy See transported King to jail, he returned to the park to continue his\n\ninvestigation. Accompanied by Missouri State Highway Patrol Trooper Adam McAtee,\n\n                                            4\n\fDeputy See searched the park and surrounding area. The officers followed a path from the\n\npark heading toward Husband's house, where Deputy See had earlier seen footprints in the\n\ndew, and continued on to a nearby pasture. Approximately one-and-a-half feet inside a\n\nfence separating the park and pasture, the officers found a knife stuck into the ground with\n\ntwo zip-ties next to a tree. At trial, M.T. identified the knife as the Rada knife that had\n\nbeen stolen from her parents' home in Cedar Falls a few days earlier.\n\n       While conducting an inventory search of the Camry, police found a newly purchased\n\nblack apron, a new kitchen towel, a new shower liner, a black-handled knife, a hammer,\n\nand an open package of zip ties with two missing that matched the two zip ties found on\n\nthe ground with the Rada knife. In the trunk of the vehicle, police found a laptop computer\n\nand two suitcases containing various items of clothing, a shaving kit, and King's high\n\nschool diploma. A forensic examination of King's phone, conducted pursuant to a warrant,\n\nrevealed that he had researched Husband's name, employment, and social media profile,\n\nand that he had looked up a map for the City of Mercer on Google Maps.\n\n       A second amended felony information charged King with: attempted first-degree\n\nassault under sections 565.0502 and 562.012; second-degree burglary under section\n\n569.170; and second-degree property damage under section 569.120. The case was tried\n\nto a jury on August 20, 2018. The jury was instructed on attempted first-degree assault,\n\nburglary in the second degree, the lesser-included offenses of first-degree and second-\n\ndegree trespass, and property damage.\n\n\n\n       2\n           All statutory references are to R.S.Mo. 2016, as updated by the operative supplement.\n\n                                                         5\n\f       The jury found King guilty of attempted first-degree assault, and second-degree\n\ntrespass. The jury acquitted King of the charge of property damage. King's trial counsel\n\ndid not request a verdict-directing instruction on the lesser-included offense of attempted\n\nsecond-degree assault, arguing to the jury that \"the most we got here is that there's basically\n\nharassment.\"\n\n       The trial court sentenced King to nine years' imprisonment on the assault offense\n\nand assessed a fine for the offense of trespass. King's convictions were affirmed on direct\n\nappeal in an unpublished per curiam order. State v. King, 591 S.W.3d 533 (Mo. App. W.D.\n\n2020). King filed a timely motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 29.15, which\n\nwas amended by appointed counsel, and the circuit court denied the amended motion\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing. This appeal follows.\n\n                                    Standard of Review\n\n       Appellate review of a motion court's Rule 29.15 judgment \"is limited to a\n\ndetermination of whether the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are\n\nclearly erroneous.\" Price v. State, 422 S.W.3d 292, 294 (Mo. banc 2014); Rule 29.15(k).\n\n\"Findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous only if a full review of the record definitely\n\nand firmly reveals that a mistake has been made.\" Morrow v. State, 21 S.W.3d 819, 822\n\n(Mo. banc 2000). \"A reviewing court must uphold a motion court's judgment if it is\n\nsustainable on any ground.\" Voss v. State, 570 S.W.3d 184, 192 (Mo. App. E.D. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                           Analysis\n\nPoint I; Lesser-included offense instruction\n\n       King's first point on appeal is that the motion court clearly erred in denying his\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing because his trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective for failing to request the trial court to submit to the jury a verdict-directing\n\ninstruction for the offense of attempted assault in the second degree, a lesser-included\n\noffense of attempted assault in the first degree. King is entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nonly if: \"(1) he pleaded facts, not conclusions, warranting relief; (2) the facts alleged are\n\nnot refuted by the record; and (3) the matters complained of resulted in prejudice to the\n\nmovant.\" McNeal v. State, 412 S.W.3d 886, 889 (Mo. banc 2013). \"Therefore, to obtain\n\nan evidentiary hearing on his claims of ineffective trial counsel for failure to request\n\ninstructions on a lesser-included offense, [King] must plead facts, not refuted by the record,\n\nshowing that the decision not to request the instruction was not reasonable trial strategy.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation omitted). King must also plead facts showing that he was prejudiced\n\nby counsel's failure to request the lesser-included offense instruction. Id. Prejudice means\n\nthat, had the lesser-included instruction been given, \"there is a reasonable probability that\n\nthe outcome of the trial would have been different[.]\" Id. (quoting Anderson v. State, 196\n\nS.W.3d 28, 33 (Mo. banc 2006)).\n\n       There is a presumption that trial counsel's performance was sufficient. McNeal, 412\n\nS.W.3d at 890. Although \"doubt as to whether to instruct on the lesser-included offense is\n\nresolved in favor of giving the lesser-included instruction,\" id., it can also be an objectively\n\nreasonable strategy not to submit an available lesser-included instruction, especially when\n\n                                               7\n\fthe attorney concludes that it is in the best interest of his client \"to deny the jury the\n\nopportunity to compromise on some middle ground\" between the greater offense and\n\nacquittal. Love v. State, 670 S.W.2d 499, 502 (Mo. banc 1984). King's motion alleged that\n\nhe:\n\n       was entitled to submit the nested lesser-included offense of assault in the\n       second degree. In failing to proffer an instruction on assault in the second\n       degree trial counsel failed to exercise the customary skill and diligence that\n       a reasonably competent attorney would exercise under the same or similar\n       circumstances. This prejudiced movant because, if proffered, the trial court\n       would have submitted the jury instruction on assault in the second degree[,]\n       and there is a reasonable likelihood the jury would have found movant guilty\n       of the lesser offense.\n\n       Noticeably absent from this part of King's motion is any factual allegation that\n\ncounsel's failure to offer the instruction for the lesser-included offense was due to\n\ninadvertence or that it was not a matter of reasonable trial strategy, which is the\n\npresumption. The allegation in King's motion that \"trial counsel failed to exercise the\n\ncustomary skill and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would exercise under\n\nthe same or similar circumstances\" is a legal conclusion that simply parrots the Strickland\n\nperformance standard; the motion does not make any factual allegations to support this\n\nlegal conclusion. Had King alleged sufficient facts, the motion court may well have been\n\nrequired to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether counsel's course of action\n\nwas, in fact, a matter of reasonable trial strategy. See, e.g., Watson v. State, 520 S.W.3d\n\n423, 436-37 (Mo. banc 2017); McNeal\u00b8 412 S.W.3d at 892-93. King's motion further failed\n\nto delineate any facts which would form a basis for the jury to have acquitted him on the\n\ncharge of attempted assault in the first degree while finding him guilty of attempted assault\n\n\n                                             8\n\fin the second degree. The facts recited in King's motion include: that he had made death\n\nthreats against M.T. and Husband; that he was outside of Husband's home; that he had in\n\nhis possession zip ties, knives, a machete, a shower curtain, an apron, towels, a hammer, a\n\nbaseball bat, electrical tape, his passport, and $10,000 cash and savings bonds. None of\n\nthis evidence supports an inference that King intended to merely cause Husband physical\n\ninjury (assault in the second degree) rather than serious physical injury (assault in the first\n\ndegree).3\n\n        The conclusion that the failure to request the lesser-included offense instruction to\n\nthe charge of attempted first-degree assault was in fact trial counsel's strategy rather than\n\ninadvertence is supported by the record. Trial counsel's closing argument that the jury\n\n\"must consider each and every piece of evidence in this case and you must be firmly\n\nconvinced that the [Movant] is guilty of the offense charged, not some other offense\"\n\ncombined with his argument that \"I think the most we got here is that there is basically\n\nharassment. That's not the charge[,]\" is consistent with counsel\u2019s decision to pursue an \u201call\n\nor nothing\u201d defense. \"'All-or-nothing' defenses have been upheld as sound trial strategy.\"\n\nWatson v. State, 520 S.W.3d 423, 436 (Mo. banc 2017).\n\n        We cannot conclude that the motion court clearly erred by failing to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing when King failed to allege any facts supporting his claim that trial\n\n\n\n\n         3\n           King's appellate brief argues that King had told an officer that he merely wanted to \"beat up\" Husband, as\nopposed to killing him pursuant to his death threats, but that King was \"too chicken.\" King contends that this fact\nsupports giving an instruction for attempted assault in the second degree. However, these facts were not alleged or\nargued in Husband's amended Rule 29.15 motion.\n\n                                                         9\n\fcounsel's decision not to request the instruction for the lesser-included offense was\n\nanything other than reasonable trial strategy.4 King's first point is denied.\n\nPoint II; Attempt instructions\n\n         King's second point on appeal argues that the motion court clearly erred in denying\n\nhis motion without an evidentiary hearing because trial counsel was ineffective for failing\n\nto object to Instruction No. 5, which was the verdict-directing instruction under the general\n\nattempt statute, section 562.012, rather than the instruction for the specific statute for\n\nattempted assault in the first degree under section 565.050.5\n\n         Rule 28.02(c) requires that MAI-CR instructions or verdict forms applicable to the\n\nlaw \"shall be given or used to the exclusion of any other verdict form.\" Rule 28.02(f)\n\nprovides that the giving of an instruction in violation of this rule constitutes error, and the\n\nerror's prejudicial effect shall be determined by the court \"provided that objection has been\n\ntimely made pursuant to Rule 28.03.\" Rule 28.03 requires counsel to make \"specific\n\nobjections to instructions or verdict forms considered erroneous\u2026 before the jury retires\n\nto consider its verdict\u2026.\" The State concedes that Instruction No. 5 \"did not strictly\n\ncomply with the approved instruction\" for attempted assault in the first degree. However,\n\n\n\n         4\n            While King's brief relies almost entirely on the facts in McNeal and claims that they necessitate a hearing\nin his own case, we note that McNeal had \"alleged that counsel failed to request [the lesser] instruction and that this\nfailure was not justified by any strategy or reason other than inadvertence\u2026\" McNeal, 412 S.W.3d at 889-90. King's\nown motion did not so allege, and it is much less clear that the evidence presented in this case could support a jury's\nconclusion that King only hoped to cause physical injury (the lesser-included offense) and not serious physical injury\n(the greater offense) to Husband.\n          5\n            King's second point relied on states that his counsel was ineffective in \"failing to apprise the court that he\nwas convicted of the inchoate offense of attempted assault in the first degree under section 562.012. The argument\nsection of his brief, however, reveals that the essence of his complaint is that counsel failed to object to the manner in\nwhich the jury was instructed on the first-degree assault. Arguments raised in the argument portion of the brief but\nnot set forth in the point relied on are not preserved, and therefore waived. Ziade v. Quality Business Solutions, Inc.,\n618 S.W.3d 537, 544 (Mo. App. W.D. 2021).\n\n                                                           10\n\fthe State argues, trial counsel's failure to object to the instruction is not reversible because\n\nKing fails to show that the error was prejudicial in that there is not a reasonable probability\n\nthat, had counsel properly objected, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n\nSee State v. Perry, 548 S.W.3d 292, 301 (Mo. banc 2018).\n\n       The instruction as submitted by the state was based upon MAI-CR 4th 404.06\n\n(2017) and, as given to the jury, read:\n\n       As to Count I, if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable\n       doubt:\n\n       First, that on or about September 28, 2017, in the State of Missouri, the\n       defendant possessed zip ties, a bush knife, a shower curtain, towels, a\n       passport, a large amount of cash, at least one suitcase filled with clothing,\n       and monitored the home of [Husband], and\n\n       Second, that such conduct was a substantial step toward the commission of\n       the offense of assault in the first degree, and\n\n       Third, that defendant engaged in such conduct for the purpose of committing\n       such assault in the first degree against [Husband],\n\n       then you will find the defendant guilty under Count I of an attempt to commit\n       assault in the first degree.\n\n       However, unless you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable\n       doubt each and all of these propositions, you must find the defendant guilty\n       of that offense.\n\n       The terms \"assault in the first degree,\" \"serious physical injury,\" and \"attempted\"\n\nwere defined in separate instructions. Instruction No. 10 provided, \"As used in this\n\ninstruction, the term 'assault in the first degree' means an attempt to kill or knowingly cause\n\nor attempting to cause serious physical injury to another person.\" Instruction No. 11\n\nprovided, \"As used in this instruction, the term 'serious physical injury' means physical\n\n\n                                              11\n\finjury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes serious disfigurement or\n\nprotracted loss of impairment of the function of any part of the body.\" Instruction No. 12\n\nprovided:\n\n      As used in this Instruction, the term 'attempted' means the doing of any act,\n      with the purpose of committing an offense, which act is a substantial step\n      toward the commission of the offense. A substantial step means conduct\n      which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to\n      complete the commission of the offense. It is no defense that it was factually\n      or legally impossible to commit assault if such offense could have been\n      committed had the circumstances been as the defendant believed them to be.\n\n      The correct instruction for assault in the first degree as charged in this case is, as\n\nKing argues, MAI-CR 4th 419.08 (2017), which reads:\n\n      As to Count I, if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable\n      doubt:\n\n      First, that on or about September 28, 2017, in the State of Missouri, the\n      defendant attempted to kill or cause serious physical injury to [Husband] by\n      possessing zip ties, a bush knife, a shower curtain, towels, a passport, a large\n      amount of cash, at least one suitcase filled with clothing, and monitored the\n      home of [Husband],\n\n      then you will find the defendant guilty under Count I of assault in the first\n      degree.\n\n      However, unless you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable\n      doubt each and all of these propositions, you must find the defendant not\n      guilty of that offense.\n\n      As use in this instruction, a person attempts to kill or cause serious physical\n      injury if, with the purpose of killing or causing serious physical injury he\n      does an act that is a substantial step toward causing that death or serious\n      physical injury. A \"substantial step\" is conduct that is strongly corroborative\n      of the firmness of the actor's purpose to cause that death or serious physical\n      injury.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f       As used in this instruction, \"serious physical injury\" means physical injury\n       that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes serious disfigurement or\n       protracted loss of impairment of the function of any part of the body.\n\nKing does not argue that any element of the offense was omitted from the instructions given\n\nto the jury, only that by setting forth the definitions in separate instructions and by not\n\nspecifically referring to the definitional instructions in the verdict director for this offense\n\nthe jury was misled and he was prejudiced by the error. However, the notes on use for this\n\ninstruction state that if the defined terms \"assault\" and \"serious physical injury\" \"are used\n\nin more than one instruction, the paragraph[s] defining [those] terms need not be included\n\nin this instruction. In that case, such terms must be defined in a separate instruction.\" MAI-\n\nCR 4th 419.08, note 8 (2017). While the definitions were given in separate instructions,\n\neven though the relevant terms were not used in more than one instruction, it is difficult to\n\nunderstand how this would have changed the outcome of the trial when the notes on use\n\nwould have specifically allowed the definitional instructions to be set forth in separate\n\ninstructions in any case where the defined term was used in more than one instruction.\n\n       Rule 28.03 requires a judicial determination of the prejudicial effect of an\n\ninstructional error, if a proper timely objection is made. Assuming counsel had made a\n\nproper and timely objection and the trial court had still submitted the erroneous instruction,\n\nKing would be required to have shown \"that the offending instruction misled, misdirected,\n\nor confused the jury, or that this error materially affected the outcome of the trial.\" State\n\nv. Julius, 453 S.W.3d 288, 304 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014). Moreover, when determining\n\nwhether an instructional error was prejudicial, the reviewing court looks at \"all submitted\n\ninstructions together\" to see whether the jury was reasonably likely to have been misled or\n\n                                              13\n\fconfused. State v. Anderson, 306 S.W.3d 529, 535 (Mo. banc 2010). Here, taken together,\n\nthe instructions given to the jury contained language nearly identical to the language in\n\nMAI-CR 4th 419.08. And while King makes much of the fact that the defining instructions\n\nsay \"[a]s used in this instruction,\" (emphasis added) rather than \"as used in these\n\ninstructions\" it is difficult to believe that the jury would have been misled to think that the\n\ndefinitions did not apply to the verdict-directing instruction, Instruction No. 5, when that\n\nis the only instruction where the relevant terms were used. The definitional instructions\n\nwere each limited to only the definition of a single term, and thus there would be no need\n\nto define each term only for purposes of the instruction providing its definition.\n\n       Because, when taken as a whole, there is no reasonable likelihood that the\n\ninstructions given misled, misdirected, or confused the jury as to the elements of the\n\noffense, there is no reasonable likelihood that the outcome of King's trial would have been\n\ndifferent had trial counsel made a timely objection to the instructional error. Because King\n\nhas shown no prejudice, his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object\n\nto the instruction fails. Williams v. State, 490 S.W.3d 398, 406 (Mo. App. W.D. 2016).\n\nKing's Point II is denied.\n\nPoint III; Parole Eligibility\n\n       King's third point on appeal is that the motion court clearly erred in denying his\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing because, during\n\nsentencing, the sentencing court \"was under the mistaken assumption that [King] would\n\nnot have to serve 85 percent of his sentence before becoming parole eligible.\" Because\n\nappellate counsel did not submit the sentencing hearing transcript on direct appeal, King\n\n                                              14\n\falleges that the motion court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine\n\nwhether the sentencing court was, in fact, subject to this mistaken belief when he sentenced\n\nKing.\n\n        \"[R]eview of any claimed error at sentencing is a matter for direct appeal.\" Arbeiter\n\nv. State, 738 S.W.2d 515, 516 (Mo. App. E.D. 1987). King did bring a challenge to his\n\nsentence on direct appeal, arguing that the circuit court erred in entering a conviction for\n\nattempted first-degree assault as a class B felony because the information charged the\n\noffense as a class C felony. This Court, in its unpublished per curiam order, disagreed with\n\nKing's position in his direct appeal, noting that his argument was wholly without citation\n\nto relevant legal authority and without explanation as to why such legal authority was not\n\navailable. The sentencing court's alleged mistaken assumption as to his parole eligibility\n\ncould similarly have been brought on direct appeal. Such matters \"cannot be raised in a\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief except in rare and exceptional circumstances,\" and post-\n\nconviction proceedings \"cannot be used as a vehicle to obtain a second appellate review of\n\nmatters which were or should have been raised on direct appeal.\" Id; Voss v. State, 570\n\nS.W.3d 184, 192 (Mo. App. E.D. 2019). And although King faults his appellate counsel\n\nfor failing to file the sentencing hearing transcript as part of the record on his direct appeal,\n\nhis point relied on does not allege ineffectiveness of appellate counsel.\n\n        Finally, as the motion court found, while the sentencing court might have misstated\n\nthe range of punishment, King did not show that the resulting sentence was \"a manifest\n\ninjustice or miscarriage of justice\" as he was required to do to establish plain error. State\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\fv. Pierce, 548 S.W.3d 900, 904 (Mo. banc 2018). The sentence he received was within the\n\nrange of punishment for the offense he committed.\n\n      Point III is denied.\n\n\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n      For all of the above-stated reasons, the judgment of the motion court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         __________________________________\n                                         Gary D.
