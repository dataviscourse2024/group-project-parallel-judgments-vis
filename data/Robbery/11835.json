The indictment charged that\n\nDarlene, as Executive Director (\u201cED\u201d) of the Thomaston Housing Authority\n\n(\u201cTHA\u201d), conspired with her husband Lance to honor a previous ED\u2019s contracts\n\nbetween the THA and Steve Williams Painting (\u201cSWP\u201d). SWP was a \u201csubterfuge\u201d\n\nfor Lance\u2019s painting company, and Lance received payment from the SWP\n\ncontracts. These actions violated a conflict-of-interest provision located in the\n\nTHA\u2019s annual contract with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment (\u201cHUD\u201d) that provided that no officer of the THA Board could enter\n\ninto a contract in which any member of the officer\u2019s immediate family had an\n\ninterest. The evidence at trial showed that Lance and Darlene collaborated and\n\nagreed to create and maintain contracts with SWP in order to hide the fact that\n\nLance was actually contracting with the THA, in violation of the relevant conflict-\n\nof-interest provision. At trial, the government also introduced evidence that some\n\nof the contracts between the THA and SWP were forged after the previous ED\u2019s\n\ndeath and violated a separate, more restrictive conflict-of-interest provision\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                Case: 12-10685    Date Filed: 01/08/2013   Page: 3 of 14\n\nenacted by the THA itself.\n\n         On appeal, the defendants each argue that: (1) there was a constructive\n\namendment of the indictment because the indictment charged Lance and Darlene\n\nwith conspiring to have the THA honor the previous ED\u2019s pre-existing contracts,\n\nin contravention of the HUD conflict-of-interest provision, while the trial evidence\n\nshowed that the contracts at issue were forgeries created after the prior ED\u2019s death\n\nand which violated the THA\u2019s conflict-of-interest provision, not HUD\u2019s provision,\n\nas charged; (2) the indictment was fatally deficient because the conspiracy count\n\nomitted the specific-intent elements of the underlying object offenses in the\n\nconspiracy count; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the defendants\u2019\n\nconspiracy convictions; (4) the defendants\u2019 sentences were procedurally\n\nunreasonable because the district court used the face amounts of the contracts\n\nbetween the THA and SWP to establish the loss amount under the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines; and (5) the district court erred by denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a\n\nnew trial because a juror\u2019s post-verdict statement that it was a waste of time to sit\n\nfor a six-day trial when Lance and Darlene had been indicted by the federal\n\ngovernment showed that the juror committed misconduct during voir dire by\n\nindicating that the indictment would not affect the juror\u2019s opinion of innocence or\n\nguilt.\n\n                                           3\n\f             Case: 12-10685     Date Filed: 01/08/2013   Page: 4 of 14\n\n      After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the\n\ndefendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.\n\n                                         I.\n\n      We review questions of constitutional law and denials of motions for\n\njudgment of acquittal de novo. United States v. Ward, 486 F.3d 1212, 1220-21\n\n(11th Cir. 2007). A defendant cannot be tried on charges that are not made against\n\nhim in the indictment, and when evidence at trial deviates from what is alleged in\n\nthe indictment, either a constructive amendment or a variance can arise. United\n\nStates v. Flynt, 15 F.3d 1002, 1005 (11th Cir. 1994).\n\n      The concepts of constructive amendment and variance are \u201coft-confused.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Narog, 372 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir. 2004). A constructive\n\namendment occurs \u201cwhen the essential elements of the offense contained in the\n\nindictment are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is\n\ncontained in the indictment.\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Keller, 916 F.2d 628,\n\n634 (11th Cir. 1990)). In other words, jury instructions cannot allow a conviction\n\non broader grounds than those alleged in the indictment. Id. at 1248. \u201cThe danger\n\nthat we are concerned with is that a defendant may have been convicted on a\n\nground not alleged by the grand jury\u2019s indictment.\u201d United States v. Behety, 32\n\nF.3d 503, 509 (11th Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). The indictment\n\n                                         4\n\f                Case: 12-10685   Date Filed: 01/08/2013   Page: 5 of 14\n\ncan be expanded literally or in effect, by the prosecutor\u2019s actions or the court\u2019s\n\ninstructions. Id. at 508-09. A constructive amendment \u201cis per se reversible error.\u201d\n\nNarog, 372 F.3d at 1247.\n\n      On the other hand, a \u201cvariance occurs when the facts proved at trial deviate\n\nfrom the facts contained in the indictment but the essential elements of the offense\n\nare the same.\u201d Id. (quoting Keller, 916 F.2d at 634). The allegations in the\n\nindictment and proof at trial must correspond so that the defendant may present a\n\ndefense and so that the defendant is protected against a subsequent prosecution for\n\nthe same offense. United States v. Reed, 887 F.2d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir. 1989).\n\nUnlike a constructive amendment, a variance requires reversal only when the\n\ndefendant can establish that his rights were substantially prejudiced. Narog, 372\n\nF.3d at 1247.\n\n      The difference between the two concepts is illustrated in Narog. The\n\ndefendants in Narog appealed their convictions of possession of pseudoephedrine\n\nwith the intent to manufacture a controlled substance, where the indictment\n\nspecifically charged the defendants with the intent to manufacture\n\nmethamphetamine. Narog, 372 F.3d at 1244, 1246. The government put on\n\nevidence that showed that the defendants intended to manufacture\n\nmethamphetamine. Id. at 1246. In response to a jury question, the court instructed\n\n                                          5\n\f              Case: 12-10685     Date Filed: 01/08/2013    Page: 6 of 14\n\nthat the government only had to prove that the defendants intended to manufacture\n\na controlled substance, not that they intended to manufacture methamphetamine\n\nspecifically. Id. at 1246-47. We held that this was not a variance issue because\n\n\u201c[t]he facts proved at trial did not deviate from the facts alleged in the indictment.\u201d\n\nId. at 1247. This was, however, a constructive amendment because the\n\ngovernment had charged a subset of the statutory crime, methamphetamine, and\n\nthe court\u2019s response to the jury question broadened the crimes charged in the\n\nindictment to include all controlled substances. Id. at 1249.\n\n      \u201cThe elements of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 are (1) an agreement\n\namong two or more persons to achieve an unlawful objective; (2) knowing and\n\nvoluntary participation in the agreement; and (3) an overt act by a conspirator in\n\nfurtherance of the agreement.\u201d United States v. Hasson, 333 F.3d 1264, 1270\n\n(11th Cir. 2003). Section 666(a)(1)(A) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code makes it\n\nillegal to steal from an organization receiving federal funds. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 666(a)(1)(A). Section 641 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code makes it illegal to steal\n\nmoney from the United States. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641.\n\n      We do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.\n\nUnited States v. Martinez, 83 F.3d 371, 377 n.6 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\n      First, because Darlene briefly mentions in her reply brief that a variance\n\n                                           6\n\f              Case: 12-10685     Date Filed: 01/08/2013    Page: 7 of 14\n\noccurred, we will not consider this argument. See id. Second, Lance and Darlene\n\nhave not shown that there was a constructive amendment of the indictment\n\nbecause the trial evidence showing that the SWP contracts were entered into after\n\na prior ED\u2019s death was not inconsistent with the indictment\u2019s allegation that such\n\ncontracts were entered into to hide the fact that Lance and Darlene had essentially\n\ncontracted the work to Lance\u2019s company. Further, the evidence showed that Lance\n\nand Darlene violated the HUD conflict-of-interest provision listed in the\n\nindictment.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      \u201cWhether an indictment sufficiently alleges a statutorily proscribed offense\n\nis a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d United States v. Steele, 178 F.3d\n\n1230, 1233 (11th Cir. 1999). \u201cAn indictment is sufficient if it: (1) presents the\n\nessential elements of the charged offense, (2) notifies the accused of the charges to\n\nbe defended against, and (3) enables the accused to rely upon a judgment under\n\nthe indictment as a bar against double jeopardy for any subsequent prosecution for\n\nthe same offense.\u201d Id. at 1233-34 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]f a\n\ngeneral description of the offense is given then it is also necessary to allege facts\n\nand circumstances which will inform the defendant of the specific offense with\n\nwhich he is being charged.\u201d Id. at 1234 (quoting Belt v. United States, 868 F.2d\n\n                                           7\n\f                Case: 12-10685       Date Filed: 01/08/2013       Page: 8 of 14\n\n1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 1989)). As noted above, \u201c[t]he elements of a conspiracy\n\nunder \u00a7 371 are (1) an agreement among two or more persons to achieve an\n\nunlawful objective; (2) knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement; and\n\n(3) an overt act by a conspirator in furtherance of the agreement.\u201d Hasson, 333\n\nF.3d at 1270.\n\n       Darlene relies on United States v. Fischetti, 450 F.2d 34 (5th Cir. 1971).1\n\nThe defendants in Fischetti were convicted on two counts of violating 29 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 186(b)(1), a labor relations provision, and one count of conspiracy to violate\n\n\u00a7 186. Fischetti, 450 F.2d at 37. The former Fifth Circuit affirmed the conspiracy\n\nconviction and reversed the convictions on the substantive counts. Id. The\n\ndefendants challenged the conspiracy count on appeal because it made reference\n\nonly to the number of the statute the defendants were alleged to have conspired to\n\nviolate. Id. at 40. The defendants argued that, because \u00a7 186 contained several\n\nprohibitions, they should have been apprised of exactly which provision of the\n\nstatute they were charged with conspiring to violate. Id. Because defendants had\n\nnot preserved the issue at trial, and it was not a jurisdictional defect, the former\n\n\n\n       1\n        In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), we\nadopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to\nOctober 1, 1981.\n\n\n                                                8\n\f              Case: 12-10685     Date Filed: 01/08/2013   Page: 9 of 14\n\nFifth Circuit did not decide this issue. Id. The defendants also contended that the\n\nconspiracy count alleged the object of the conspiracy in the same language that\n\nwas used in the substantive counts, and, because the latter were defective because\n\nof an omitted essential element of willfulness, the conspiracy count was likewise\n\ndefective. Id. The former Fifth Circuit held that this argument was without merit,\n\nand stated that \u201c[i]n a conspiracy count the conspiracy is the gist of the offense,\u201d\n\nand that the object of the conspiracy does not need to be described in the same\n\ndetail as would an indictment for the substantive offense itself. Id. \u201cEvery\n\nelement of the substantive offense need not be alleged within the conspiracy\n\ncount.\u201d Id.\n\n      We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in refusing to\n\ndismiss the indictment because it correctly provided all of the essential elements of\n\nthe conspiracy offense, and the indictment was not required to list the essential\n\nelements of the substantive offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      Again, we review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction de\n\nnovo. Hasson, 333 F.3d at 1270. \u201cThe record is viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all\n\nquestions of credibility in favor of the government.\u201d Id. We will affirm the\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 12-10685    Date Filed: 01/08/2013    Page: 10 of 14\n\nverdict \u201cif a reasonable juror could conclude that the evidence establishes guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.\n\n      As noted above, the elements of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 are\n\n(1) an agreement among two or more people to achieve an unlawful objective,\n\n(2) knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement, and (3) an overt act by a\n\nconspirator in furtherance of the agreement. Id. In order to convict someone of\n\nfraudulently obtaining or misapplying funds from an organization receiving\n\nfederal assistance, the government must prove: (1) the defendant converted\n\nproperty owned by, or under the care, custody, or control of an organization\n\nreceiving federal assistance; (2) the defendant was an agent of such an\n\norganization; (3) that property was valued at $5,000 or more; and (4) the\n\norganization received in excess of $10,000 in federal funds during the 1-year\n\nperiod in which the defendant converted the property. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A);\n\nsee United States v. Tampas, 493 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that\n\nan embezzlement conviction under \u00a7 666 requires proof of conversion of property\n\nvalued at greater than $5,000 from an organization that receives more than\n\n$10,000 in federal funds each year).\n\n      We conclude from the record that the evidence was sufficient for a\n\nreasonable jury to conclude that Lance and Darlene were knowing participants in\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 12-10685     Date Filed: 01/08/2013    Page: 11 of 14\n\nthe conspiracy. The evidence showed that Lance (1) entered into an agreement\n\nwith Darlene to steal from the THA, in violation of \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); (2) received\n\nmoney from the checks written to SWP; and (3) urged the \u201cowner\u201d of SWP not to\n\ndisclose the true nature of the SWP painting contracts. The evidence showed that\n\nDarlene (1) was the ED of the THA at the time of the charged conspiracy; (2)\n\nentered into an agreement with Lance to steal from the THA, in violation of\n\n\u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); and (3) as ED, requested that the THA Board honor its pre-\n\nexisting contracts with SWP, despite knowing that doing so would violate the\n\nrelevant conflict-of-interest provision.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n      We review the district court\u2019s amount-of-loss determination for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Renick, 273 F.3d 1009, 1025 (11th Cir. 2001). Section\n\n2B1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a sentencing enhancement\n\nbased on the amount of loss caused by the defendant\u2019s offense. U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1). This section indicates that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be\n\nincreased by 12 if the offense involved a loss amount of more than $200,000 but\n\nnot more than $400,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(G). \u201cWhen calculating loss for\n\nsentencing purposes, the district court looks to the greater of actual loss or\n\nintended loss.\u201d United States v. Willis, 560 F.3d 1246, 1250 (11th Cir. 2009)\n\n                                           11\n\f              Case: 12-10685    Date Filed: 01/08/2013    Page: 12 of 14\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Actual loss is \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable\n\npecuniary harm that resulted from the offense,\u201d and intended loss is \u201cthe pecuniary\n\nharm that was intended to result from the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment.\n\n(n.3(A)(i) and (ii)).\n\n       The Guidelines do not require a precise determination of loss, and a court\n\nneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\n\nRenick, 273 F.3d at 1025. Upon challenge, however, the government bears the\n\nburden of supporting its loss calculation with \u201creliable and specific evidence.\u201d Id.\n\n(citation omitted). The district court should make a reasonable estimate of the loss\n\namount, which cannot be mere speculation, but is not required to be completely\n\nprecise. United States v. Walker, 490 F.3d 1282, 1300 (11th Cir. 2007). Loss can\n\nbe estimated based on the fair market value of the stolen property, or, \u201cif the fair\n\nmarket value is impracticable to determine or inadequately measures the harm, the\n\ncost to the victim of replacing that property.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment.\n\n(n.3(C)(i)); United States v. Cannon, 41 F.3d 1462, 1467 (11th Cir. 1995)\n\n(affirming the district court\u2019s use of the contract value as the amount of loss in a\n\nconspiracy to defraud the government under previous \u00a7 2B1.1, which provided for\n\na similar valuation of loss). We have recognized that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in\n\na unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that\n\n                                          12\n\f             Case: 12-10685      Date Filed: 01/08/2013    Page: 13 of 14\n\nevidence,\u201d and, thus, \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2019s determination of loss is entitled to\n\nappropriate deference.\u201d Willis, 560 F.3d at 1251 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      We conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err by\n\nestablishing the loss amount based on the gain to Lance and Darlene, measured by\n\nthe face value of the contracts to SWP, where the loss was difficult to calculate in\n\nthe absence of an honest and open bidding process.\n\n                                           V.\n\n      We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a new trial or an\n\nevidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Quilca-Carpio,\n\n118 F.3d 719, 722 (11th Cir. 1997). \u201cInvestigation of alleged juror misconduct is\n\ncommitted to the discretion of the district court and is reviewed only for an abuse\n\nof that discretion.\u201d United States v. Carpa, 271 F.3d 962, 967 (11th Cir. 2011)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA court enjoys substantial discretion in\n\nchoosing the investigative procedure to be used in checking for juror misconduct.\u201d\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Because a \u201clitigant is entitled to a fair trial, but not a perfect one,\u201d courts\n\nshould \u201cignore errors that do not affect the essential fairness of the trial.\u201d Id. at\n\n966 (internal quotation marks omitted). Voir dire protects \u201cthe right to a jury\n\n                                           13\n\f             Case: 12-10685     Date Filed: 01/08/2013    Page: 14 of 14\n\ncapable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it,\u201d and, thus,\n\nerrors during voir dire can warrant a new trial. Id. \u201cTo invalidate the result of a\n\nlong and burdensome trial because of a juror\u2019s mistaken, though honest, response\n\nto a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial system\n\ncan be expected to give.\u201d Id. at 966-67 (internal quotation marks omitted). A\n\nparty challenging her trial must show, first, that a juror\u2019s answer to a material\n\nquestion on voir dire was dishonest, and second, that an honest answer would\n\nhave provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Id. at 967. There must be a\n\nshowing of bias that would disqualify a juror, which can be shown by express\n\nadmission or proof of specific facts showing such a close connection to the case at\n\nhand that bias is presumed. Id. \u201cA juror\u2019s dishonesty is a strong indication of\n\nbias.\u201d Id.\n\n      We conclude that the district court did not err by denying Lance and\n\nDarlene\u2019s motion for a new trial because there was no evidence that a juror\n\ncommitted misconduct during voir dire by denying that the indictment affected the\n\njuror\u2019s opinion of Lance and Darlene\u2019s innocence or guilt.\n\n      For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the defendants\u2019 convictions and\n\nsentences.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n                                          14\n\f",
