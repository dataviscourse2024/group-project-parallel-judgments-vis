Jose De Horta Garcia, then a\npermanent resident alien, was deported in 1996 because\nhe had been convicted of a drug trafficking crime.\nThis case involves his second illegal re-entry into the\ncountry after deportation. During his first prosecution\nfor illegal re-entry, he challenged the validity of his\ndeportation order on the grounds that he was denied his\nright to seek a discretionary waiver of deportation\nunder former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1995)\n(repealed), arguing that the repeal of discretionary\nwaiver should not have been applied to prevent him from\n\f2                                              No. 07-2060\n\napplying for the waiver. The District of Alaska rejected his\ncontention and De Horta Garcia did not appeal. He raised\nthe argument again in this prosecution and the district\ncourt rejected it based on circuit precedent. We affirm.\n\n\n                       Background\n  De Horta Garcia first came to the United States from\nMexico in 1976. He married a United States citizen in 1983\nand became a lawful permanent resident. By November\n1995, De Horta Garcia had separated from his wife and\nmoved to Alaska where he was arrested in a drug sting.\nIn February 1996, De Horta Garcia waived his speedy\ntrial rights, ALASKA R. CRIM. P. 45, extending the state\u2019s\ntime to prosecute him into June 1996. In June 1996 he\npleaded guilty to attempted misconduct involving a\ncontrolled substance. He appeared, without counsel, at a\ngroup deportation hearing in December 1996 and was\nordered deported under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C); 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C), which at that time made excludable any\nalien who had been an illicit trafficker of any controlled\nsubstance. He was released at the Mexican border the\nnext day.\n  The timing of De Horta Garcia\u2019s guilty plea and deporta-\ntion were very unfortunate for him. Had he pleaded guilty\nand appeared at a deportation hearing only a few months\nearlier, before April 23, 1996, he would have had the\nright to petition the Attorney General for relief from\ndeportation. See INA \u00a7 212(c); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1995)\n(repealed); see also INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 295-96\n(2001). When Congress passed the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act, effective April 23, 1996,\nhowever, it amended \u00a7 212(c) so that it no longer applied\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                  3\n\nto aliens, including De Horta Garcia, made excludable\nfor most controlled substance offenses. See INA \u00a7 212(c);\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(c), 1251(a)(2)(B) (1996). The IJ at De Horta\nGarcia\u2019s deportation hearing apparently concluded that\nAEDPA\u2019s modification of \u00a7 212(c) applied to aliens who\noffended and were arrested before the modification but\nconvicted after it, and so did not tell De Horta Garcia\nthat he had a right to petition the Attorney General for\nrelief from deportation.\n  About a year after he was deported, De Horta Garcia\nwas discovered in Alaska and charged with illegal re-entry\nafter deportation. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). The District\nCourt for the District of Alaska initially dismissed the\nindictment, finding that the original deportation rested on\nan impermissible retroactive application of \u00a7 212(c) in\nviolation of the Due Process Clause. On the government\u2019s\nmotion for reconsideration, though, the district court\nreversed itself based on binding Ninth Circuit precedent.\nDe Horta Garcia was ultimately convicted of illegal re-\nentry, and he did not appeal. At the end of his prison term\nin June 2002, he was deported to Mexico again.\n  After the district court\u2019s initial dismissal of the indict-\nment, De Horta Garcia moved to reopen his original\ndeportation proceedings and stay his deportation order.\nThe IJ denied De Horta Garcia\u2019s motion before the dis-\ntrict court reconsidered its dismissal. The IJ\u2019s ruling was\nbased on BIA precedent, as well as De Horta Garcia\u2019s\nfailure to move to reopen within the 90 days allowed by\n8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.23. Nothing in the record suggests that\nDe Horta Garcia appealed the IJ\u2019s ruling.\n  After being deported a second time, De Horta Garcia\nfound his way back into the United States once again. This\n\f4                                                No. 07-2060\n\ntime he was arrested in Wisconsin in September 2006 on\nretail theft charges. After being referred to federal authori-\nties, he was again indicted for illegal re-entry after de-\nportation, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2), and again argued\nthat his original deportation was invalid because he was\ndenied the right to petition the Attorney General for\ndiscretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c). The\ndistrict court rejected this argument based on LaGuerre v.\nReno, 164 F.3d 1035, 1041 (7th Cir. 1998), which con-\ncluded that AEDPA\u2019s bar against discretionary waivers\napplied retroactively to aliens, like De Horta Garcia,\nwho offended before its passage, but were convicted after\nits passage. De Horta Garcia pleaded guilty, but reserved\nhis right to appeal the retroactivity issue.\n\n\n                          Analysis\n   De Horta Garcia begins by conceding, as he must, that\nthe district court properly relied upon LaGuerre and goes\non to predict that \u201cin all likelihood,\u201d we will not revisit\nour prior precedent. But counsel for De Horta Garcia\nmakes a hard argument harder by not fully presenting\nhis arguments for reconsidering LaGuerre in his brief.\nInstead counsel includes in his short appendix the brief\nhe filed in the district court and states in his appellate\nbrief that it is \u201cincorporated herein.\u201d We normally refuse\nto consider such incorporations because \u201c[e]ven when a\nlitigant has unused space . . ., incorporation is a point-\nless imposition on the court\u2019s time.\u201d DeSilva v. DeLeonardi,\n181 F.3d 865, 867 (7th Cir. 1999).\n  In the context of a litigant\u2019s failure to provide a trans-\ncript under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b), we\nhave held that where \u201cmeaningful review is possible,\u201d\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                5\n\nwe may exercise our discretion and rule on the merits.\nUnited States v. Santiago-Ochoa, 447 F.3d 1015, 1018-19\n(7th Cir. 2006). Because meaningful review is possible\u2014but\njust barely\u2014in this case and because we hesitate to thwart\nDe Horta Garcia\u2019s stated objective to challenge our prece-\ndent in the Supreme Court, we address the arguments on\nthe merits.\n  Before analyzing De Horta Garcia\u2019s primary argument,\nthough, we must analyze a procedural bar that he cannot\novercome under circuit precedent. Section 1326(d) allows\na collateral attack of a deportation order only upon a\nshowing that\n    (1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies\n    that may have been available to seek relief against\n    the order;\n    (2) the deportation proceedings at which the order\n    was issued improperly deprived the alien of the\n    opportunity for judicial review; and\n    (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). Although De Horta Garcia can arguably\nmeet the first two conditions, we have previously held\nthat an alien in his position cannot meet the third.\n  To show fundamental unfairness, De Horta Garcia must\nshow, first, a violation of due process, and second, that he\nwas prejudiced by the removal proceedings. See Santi-\nago-Ochoa, 447 F.3d at 1019. If De Horta Garcia truly lost\nhis opportunity to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief that might\nhave been granted, then he might have been able to\nshow that he was prejudiced, i.e., that judicial review\n\u201cwould have yielded him relief from deportation.\u201d See\nUnited States v. Espinoza-Farlo, 34 F.3d 469, 471 (7th Cir.\n\f6                                               No. 07-2060\n\n1994). But, we have joined the majority of circuits in\nholding that due process does not encompass a \u201cright to\nbe informed of eligibility for\u2014or to be considered for\u2014\ndiscretionary relief.\u201d Santiago-Ochoa, 447 F.3d at 1020; but\nsee United States v. Copeland, 376 F.3d 61, 71 (2d Cir. 2004)\n(failure to inform alien of right to discretionary relief can\nbe fundamentally unfair); United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa,\n364 F.3d 1042, 1049-50 (9th Cir. 2004) (same). Thus, under\nthis circuit\u2019s precedent, the violation De Horta Garcia\ncontends occurred at his deportation hearing did not\nmake the deportation order \u201cfundamentally unfair,\u201d and\nhe may not collaterally attack it in this prosecution. See\nSantiago-Ochoa, 447 F.3d at 1020.\n   Finally, even if De Horta Garcia could steer clear of\nthe roadblocks preventing him from collaterally attacking\nhis deportation order, his attack itself is also foreclosed\nby circuit precedent. In LaGuerre, we explained that the\nchange to \u00a7 212(c) would apply retroactively unless it\nwould disturb reasonable expectations. LaGuerre, 164 F.3d\nat 1041. But we concluded that applying the new law\nretroactively to aliens like De Horta Garcia would not\ndisturb reasonable expectations because \u201c[i]t would border\non the absurd to argue that these aliens might have de-\ncided not to commit drug crimes . . . had they known that\nif they were not only imprisoned but also, when their\nprison term ended, ordered deported, they could not ask\nfor a discretionary waiver of deportation.\u201d Id. We have\nheld that retroactive application is impermissible because\nit would disturb reasonable expectations in only two\nsituations: (1) when an alien had conceded deportability\nbefore repeal in reliance on the possibility of \u00a7 212(c) re-\nlief, Reyes-Hernandez v. INS, 89 F.3d 490, 492-93 (7th Cir.\n1996), and (2) when an alien had pleaded guilty to the\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                7\n\nunderlying offense before repeal partly in reliance on the\npossibility of relief, Jideonwo v. INS, 224 F.3d 692, 700\n(7th Cir. 2000). In both cases, we required a showing of\nspecific facts demonstrating actual reliance. Id.; Reyes-\nHernandez, 89 F.3d at 492. In St. Cyr, the Supreme Court\nheld that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) did not apply retroactively\nto any alien who pleaded guilty before its passage, 533\nU.S. at 321, 323-24, but we have not read that case as\naltering the actual reliance requirement. The rule in this\ncircuit remains that relief under \u00a7 212(c) is not available\nto any alien whose removal proceeding began after\nrepeal except to those who affirmatively abandoned\nrights or admitted guilt in reliance on \u00a7 212(c) relief.\nMontenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035, 1037 (7th Cir. 2004).\nBecause De Horta Garcia cannot show such affirmative\nreliance, his primary argument is foreclosed by circuit\nprecedent.\n  De Horta Garcia notes, however, that other circuits have\ntaken alternative approaches to the reliance question. First,\nsome circuits have applied St. Cyr to aliens who did not\nplead guilty or concede deportability before enactment,\nbut did take some affirmative action in their prosecution\nthat evidenced reliance on \u00a7 212(c) before enactment. E.g.,\nRestrepo v. McElroy, 369 F.3d 627, 634-35 (2d Cir. 2004);\nPonnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 480, 494-96 (3d. Cir. 2004).\nSecond, two circuits, the Third and the Tenth have criti-\ncized the majority of circuits for requiring a showing of\nactual detrimental reliance and have only required objec-\ntively reasonable reliance. Id. at 489-90; Hem v. Maurer,\n458 F.3d 1185, 1197 (10th Cir. 2006). The Fourth Circuit\nhas gone further and not required a showing of reliance\nat all, reasoning, in part, that it is always reasonable to\nrely on governing law. Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 383,\n\f8                                               No. 07-2060\n\n389-96 (4th Cir. 2004). De Horta Garcia attempts to rely on\nthese alternative approaches, but his arguments are far\ntoo cursory to reach the compelling reason we require\nbefore revisiting circuit precedent. See Santos v. United\nStates, 461 F.3d 886, 891 (7th Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                         Conclusion\n    We therefore AFFIRM the judgement of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n  ROVNER, Circuit Judge, concurring. I join the court in\naffirming the judgment. In key respects, De Horta Garcia\u2019s\narguments for reversal are foreclosed by this circuit\u2019s\nprecedents. I write separately to note my reservations\nabout those precedents in the hope that we will, at\nsome point, re-examine them.\n  In order to collaterally attack his deportation order,\nDe Horta Garcia must show, among other things, that the\nentry of that order was fundamentally unfair. 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3). That showing in turn demands proof that\nhe was deprived of due process and that he was prej-\nudiced thereby. United States v. Santiago-Ochoa, 447 F.3d\n1015, 1019-20 (7th Cir. 2006). De Horta Garcia posits that\nhe was deprived of due process when the Immigration\nJudge who presided over his deportation proceeding\nfailed to apprise him of his right to petition the Attorney\nGeneral for relief from deportation pursuant to section\n212(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1995) (later repealed\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                       9\n\nand replaced by a different form of discretionary relief\nknown as cancellation of removal, see 8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)).\nBut relief under section 212(c) was discretionary, and\nthis court has held that due process does not entitle an\nalien \u201cto be informed of eligibility for\u2014or to be considered\nfor\u2014discretionary relief.\u201d Santiago-Ochoa, 447 F.3d at 1020.\n   Santiago-Ochoa reflects the majority view, but I think the\nminority view, well articulated by the Second Circuit\u2019s\ndecision in United States v. Copeland, 376 F.3d 61, 70-73\n(2d Cir. 2004), has the better of the debate among the\ncircuits on this point.1 As Copeland points out, the focus on\nthe discretionary nature of section 212(c) relief fails to\nproperly distinguish the right to seek relief\u2014which under\nsection 212(c) was absolute\u2014from the right to the relief\nitself. Id. at 72.\n    The decisions holding that a failure to inform an alien\n    about Section 212(c) relief cannot be a fundamental\n    error collapse this distinction and incorrectly assume\n    that, because the grant of Section 212(c) relief itself is\n    discretionary, the denial of a Section 212(c) hearing\n    cannot be a fundamental procedural error.\nId. The Supreme Court itself has explicitly recognized\nthe distinction that the majority view has overlooked. INS\n\n\n1\n   See Anthony Distinti, Note, Gone But Not Forgotten: How Sec-\ntion 212(c) Relief Continues to Divide Courts Presiding Over\nIndictments for Illegal Reentry, 74 FORDHAM L. REV. 2809, 2825-\n35 (2006) (documenting the disparate circuit approaches);\nBrent S. Wible, The Strange Afterlife of Section 212(c) Relief:\nCollateral Attacks on Deportation Orders in Prosecutions for Illegal\nReentry After St. Cyr, 19 GEO. IMMIGR. L. J. 455, 467-80 (2005)\n(same).\n\f10                                                 No. 07-2060\n\nv. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 307, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 2283 (2001)\n(\u201cTraditionally, courts recognized a distinction between\neligibility for discretionary relief, on the one hand, and the\nfavorable exercise of discretion, on the other hand.\u201d).\nIndeed, notwithstanding the discretionary nature of\nsection 212(c) relief, the Court in St. Cyr treated the loss\nof an alien\u2019s eligibility to seek such relief as a concrete\ndetriment that counseled against applying the 1996\nrepeal of section 212(c) retroactively to aliens who\npleaded guilty to deportable offenses at a time when they\nstill would have been eligible for section 212(c) relief. Id.\nat 321-25, 121 S. Ct. at 2290-93. The Court observed that\nfor purposes of the retroactivity analysis, \u201c[t]here is a\nclear difference . . . between facing possible deportation and\nfacing certain deportation.\u201d Id. at 325, 121 S. Ct. at 2293\n(emphasis mine). Thus, although the right to relief itself\nmay be discretionary, what matters is the fact that the\nright of eligible aliens to seek relief is absolute. Copeland,\n376 F.3d at 72. For many aliens facing deportation, discre-\ntionary relief is the only avenue of relief available. Id. at 73.\nAnd it is worth noting that the prospect of relief under\nsection 212(c) by no means was illusory: as the Supreme\nCourt noted in St. Cyr, before section 212(c) was re-\npealed, more than one-half of all requests for discre-\ntionary relief were granted. 533 U.S. at 296 & n.5, 325 &\nn.54, 121 S. Ct. at 2277 & n.5, 2293 n.54; see also Vashti D.\nVan Wyke, Comment, Retroactivity and Immigration Crimes\nSince St. Cyr: Emerging Signs of Judicial Restraint, 154 U. Pa.\nL. Rev. 741, 747 & nn.32-34 (2006). Thus, when an Immi-\ngration Judge, who bears a special obligation to advise an\nalien of his legal rights, has failed to inform an unrepre-\nsented alien of his right to seek relief under section 212(c),\nthe judge has committed a fundamental procedural error\nin violation of the alien\u2019s right to due process. Copeland,\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                    11\n\n376 F.3d at 71-73; United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364\nF.3d 1042, 1049-1050 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Brent S. Wible,\nThe Strange Afterlife of Section 212(c) Relief: Collateral Attacks\non Deportation Orders In Prosecutions for Illegal Reentry After\nSt. Cyr, 19 GEO. IMMIGR. L. J. 455, 485-92 (2005) (advocating\nfor adoption of Second Circuit\u2019s approach).\n  This is not to say that the discretionary nature of section\n212(c) relief is wholly irrelevant. In order to demonstrate\na fundamental unfairness that entitles him to collaterally\nchallenge his deportation, De Horta Garcia would have\nto show not only that he was deprived of due process but\nalso that he was prejudiced by the deprivation. Santiago-\nOchoa, 447 F.3d at 1019. It is with respect to the prejudice\nprong of the analysis that the discretionary character of\nsection 212(c) relief comes into play. To establish that\nhe was harmed by the Immigration Judge\u2019s omission,\nDe Horta Garcia would have to establish some likeli-\nhood that he would have been granted relief under sec-\ntion 212(c) had he been apprised of the possibility of such\nrelief and availed himself of the right to seek it. Copeland,\n376 F.3d at 73; see Wible, 19 GEO. IMMIGR. L. J. at 490\n(describing different approaches among circuits to preju-\ndice). De Horta Garcia might or might not be able to make\nthat showing; no record has been made as to the relative\nmerits of the case he could have made for discretionary\nrelief. Under the current law of this circuit, however,\nDe Horta Garcia and others like him are never given\nthe opportunity to show that they might have obtained\nrelief under section 212(c); we instead rely on the fact\nthat section 212(c) relief was discretionary to hold that\nthere was no due process right to be apprised of such\nrelief or to be considered for it. For the reasons set forth\nin Copeland, I believe that premise is erroneous.\n\f12                                               No. 07-2060\n\n  As the court points out, even if the path were clear for\nDe Horta Garcia to mount a collateral attack on the depor-\ntation order, he would face a second obstacle in this\ncourt\u2019s precedents on retroactivity and reliance. When\nDe Horta Garcia committed his drug offense in 1995, he\nhad a right to seek relief from deportation pursuant\nto section 212(c). But by the time he was deported in\nDecember 1996, Congress, in section 440(d) of the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA),\nhad eliminated the right to seek discretionary relief for\npersons who, like De Horta Garcia, had committed drug-\nrelated offenses. See LaGuerre v. Reno, 164 F.3d 1035, 1037\n(7th Cir. 1998). De Horta Garcia\u2019s collateral challenge\nto the deportation order presumes that the change in\neligibility criteria for section 212(c) relief could not be\napplied to him, because although he was ordered de-\nported after the law changed, he committed and was\ncharged with the drug offense prior to the change. How-\never, LaGuerre, 164 F.3d at 1041, concludes that the new\nbar to discretionary relief for those convicted of drug-\nrelated offenses applies in all pending deportation pro-\nceedings, even if the alien committed the drug offense\nprior to the change in the law, so long as the change in\neligibility criteria did not disturb an alien\u2019s reasonable\nexpectations. Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035, 1037\n(7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam), in turn suggests that an alien\u2019s\nreasonable expectations have been disturbed only when\nhe actually relied to his detriment on the availability of\nsection 212(c) relief. This would be true where the alien\nconceded deportability, admitted criminal culpability,\nor otherwise abandoned his rights in the expectation that\nhe still would be eligible for section 212(c) relief. Id. But\nLaGuerre rejected the notion that simply because an alien\ncommitted the crime triggering his deportation before\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                13\n\nthe legislative change, he might have had any reasonable\nexpectation that he would continue to be eligible for\ndiscretionary relief. 164 F.3d at 1041. It struck us as\n\u201cborder[ing] on the absurd\u201d that an alien might have\nfactored the availability of such relief into his decision to\ncommit the underlying offense. Id.; see also Kelava v.\nGonzales, 434 F.3d 1120, 1124-25 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,\n127 S. Ct. 43 (2006) (coll. cases in the same vein); Van Wyke,\n154 U. PA. L. REV. at 776-77 & n.173 (same).\n   However, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Olatunji v.\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 383, 389-95 (4th Cir. 2004) (2-1 decision),\nmakes a compelling case for the proposition that reliance\nis not properly an element of the retroactivity inquiry. The\ncritical consideration, as Olatunji details at some length,\nis whether a new statute changes the legal consequences\nof acts that took place before its effective date. Id. at 390\n(quoting Society for the Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler,\n22 F. Cas. 756, 767, No. 13,1356 (C.C.D.N.H. 1814) (Story,\nJ.)). As the Fourth Circuit acknowledges, there are\nindeed references to reliance in the Supreme Court\u2019s\nretroactivity precedents. Id. at 390-91, 393-94 (discussing\nLandgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 114 S. Ct. 1483\n(1994), Hughes Aircraft Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S.\n939, 117 S. Ct. 1871 (1997), St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 121 S. Ct.\n2271, and Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, 124\nS. Ct. 2240 (2004)). That is not surprising, for reliance\nalways looms in the background as a reason explaining\nthe Court\u2019s longstanding presumption that when Con-\ngress enacts a new law, it does not intend for the law\nto apply retroactively unless it makes that intent clear. Id.\nat 393-94. The Court has assumed that society orders its\naffairs based on existing law, and that to apply new legal\nrules to acts that pre-date the change in law will, to some\n\f14                                              No. 07-2060\n\nextent, upset those expectations. But no Supreme Court\ndecision requires or turns on proof that the party con-\ntesting retroactive application of new legislation actually\nrelied to his detriment on prior law in setting his own\ncourse of conduct. \u201cSubjective reliance . . . is neither\ndictated by Supreme Court precedent nor related to the\npresumption of congressional intent underlying the bar\nagainst retroactivity.\u201d Id. at 389; see Atkinson v. Attorney\nGen. of the U.S., 479 F.3d 222, 227-31 (3d Cir. 2007); Van\nWyke, 154 U. PA. L. REV. at 787 (\u201c[U]nfairness and the\npotential for reliance on the current state of the law are\nthe reasons for the strong presumption against retroactiv-\nity, rather than the test for a retroactive effect; and the\npresumption against retroactivity is not a right to be\nearned by individuals, but a protection granted to all\nmembers of the class [of persons potentially affected\nby retroactive application of the new law]\u201d).\n   If, as the Fourth Circuit has concluded, the retroactivity\nanalysis does not turn on reliance, then De Horta Garcia\nhas a straightforward claim that he should not be deemed\nineligible for section 212(c) relief because to do so would\nbe to retroactively attach a new disability to his prior\ncriminal conduct. Before the law changed in 1996, De Horta\nGarcia\u2019s commission of a drug offense (in 1995) would\nhave rendered him deportable but at that point he none-\ntheless remained eligible for discretionary relief. And as\nSt. Cyr recognized, he had at least a fifty-fifty shot at\nobtaining such relief. 533 U.S. at 296 & n.5, 325 & n.54, 121\nS. Ct. at 2277 & n.5, 2293 n.54. After the law changed to bar\nthose convicted of drug offenses from obtaining relief\nunder section 212(c), he had no chance whatsoever. As\nSt. Cyr also acknowledged, this is a significant difference.\nId. at 325, 121 S. Ct. at 2293. Like the panel in LaGuerre,\nI too find it unlikely that when De Horta Garcia decided\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                15\n\nto commit a drug offense, he entertained any thought\nabout his prospective eligibility for relief from deportation\nin the event he was caught, convicted, and ordered de-\nported. He obviously knew that he was committing a\ncriminal offense, and if he did not actually know that\nsuch an offense would trigger his deportation, he cer-\ntainly may be charged with constructive knowledge of\nthat eventuality. Still, to retroactively hold him ineligible\nfor section 212(c) relief based on his prior crime would\nundoubtedly increase the burden he must shoulder for\nthat crime by eliminating even the possibility of relief from\ndeportation. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Landgraf\nrecognizes that legislation which imposes new disability\nor increases the extent of one\u2019s liability for past events\nshould not be applied retroactively absent clear evidence\nof an congressional intent to do so. 511 U.S. at 282-85 &\nn.35, 114 S. Ct. at 1506-07 & n.35. The Court in Hughes\nAircraft articulated the same rule for legislation that\neliminates a defense to liability. 520 U.S. at 947-49, 117\nS. Ct. at 1876-77. Barring De Horta from discretionary relief\nfrom deportation is the equivalent of these scenarios. See\nAtkinson, 479 F.3d at 230; Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d at 1054-\n56 (Pregerson, J., concurring). And because Congress,\nwhen it enacted section 440(d) of the AEDPA, expressed\nno intent to apply the new bar to section 212(c) relief\nretroactively to those who committed drug offenses prior\nto its enactment, see LaGuerre, 164 F.3d at 1040-41, De Horta\nGarcia should remain eligible for relief from deportation.\n  To the extent that reliance ought to play any role in the\nretroactivity analysis, it is objective rather than subjective\nreliance that should be considered, as the Third, Sixth, and\nTenth Circuits have concluded. See Ponnapula v. Ashcroft,\n373 F.3d 480, 494-96 (3d Cir. 2004); Thaqi v. Jenifer, 377\n\f16                                               No. 07-2060\n\nF.3d 500, 504 n.2 (6th Cir. 2004); Hem v. Maurer, 458 F.3d\n1185, 1197-99 (10th Cir. 2006); see also Olatunji, 387 F.3d\nat 396-97. And if it is objectively reasonable reliance that\nmust be established, I believe that De Horta Garcia can\nmake that showing. In February 1996, De Horta Garcia\nwaived his speedy trial rights, which extended until\nJune 1996 the State of Alaska\u2019s time to prosecute him on\nthe drug charge. At the time De Horta Garcia made the\ndecision to waive his rights, the AEDPA and its ban on\nsection 212(c) relief for those convicted of drug-related\noffenses was not yet law. It was not until April 24, 1996,\nroughly two months after the waiver, that the AEDPA had\nemerged from Congress and was signed into law by\nPresident Clinton. A person in De Horta Garcia\u2019s posi-\ntion reasonably might have believed, at the time he\nwaived his speedy trial rights, that when he eventually\npleaded guilty he would still be able to seek section 212(c)\nrelief. And there is a very real chance, that had De Horta\nGarcia not waived his speedy trial rights and his prosecu-\ntion not been delayed, he would have pleaded guilty\nbefore the AEDPA became law, thus putting him in the\nvery category of aliens that St. Cyr held could not be\ndeprived retroactively of their right to seek relief under\nsection 212(c). This set of facts is sufficient to demon-\nstrate objectively reasonable reliance on the availability\nof section 212(c) relief. Cf. Restrepo v. McElroy, 369 F.3d\n627, 634 (2d Cir. 2004) (where individual decides to post-\npone filing his application for section 212(c) relief in\norder to build a more convincing case for rehabilitation,\nbelieving that such relief would still be available at a\nlater date, \u201cthe AEDPA\u2019s undermining of this settled\nexpectation represents a prototypical case of retroactivity\u201d).\nEven if De Horta Garcia had opted for a timely trial\ninstead, it is not unreasonable to think that the continued\n\fNo. 07-2060                                                  17\n\navailability of section 212(c) relief would have factored into\nhis decision. See Ponnapula, 373 F.3d at 496 (\u201cThe reason-\nable reliance question turns on the nature of the statutory\nright and the availability of some choice affecting that\nright, not on the choice actually made.\u201d).\n  Under the law as it stands in this circuit, relief is unavail-\nable to De Horta Garcia. Persuasive authority from our\nsister circuits suggests, however, that in certain respects\nthe precedents that stand in De Horta Garcia\u2019s path may\nbe incorrect and should be re-visited.\n  I respectfully concur in the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                    USCA-02-C-0072\u20143-13-08\n\f",
