Colson\n\ncontends that the trial court judge misunderstood the applicable law and therefore\n\ffailed to consider alternative dispositions available to her, and he requests a new\n\nhearing on the State\u2019s motion to adjudicate. We affirm.\n\n                                  Background\n\n      Colson was charged by indictment with the theft of property valued over one\n\nthousand dollars, but less than twenty thousand dollars\u2014a state jail felony\u2014\n\noccurring on or about October 14, 2003. Pursuant to a plea agreement, on October\n\n5, 2004, Colson pleaded guilty.     The trial court deferred adjudication, placed\n\nColson on community supervision for two years, imposed a $600 fine, and ordered\n\nColson to complete two hundred hours of community service and make restitution.\n\nColson\u2019s two-year term of deferred-adjudication community supervision was\n\nsubject to conditions requiring that he (1) periodically report to a supervision\n\nofficer, (2) maintain employment and provide written documentation of his\n\nemployment, (3) notify his supervision officer prior to any change of residence,\n\n(4) perform community service as ordered, and (5) pay assessed fees, fines, court\n\ncosts, and restitution.\n\n      On June 20, 2006, the State filed a motion to adjudicate guilt, alleging that\n\nColson violated several conditions of his deferred-adjudication community\n\nsupervision. That same day, a capias was issued and received by the Harris\n\nCounty Sheriff\u2019s Office.    The capias was executed over eight years later on\n\nOctober 21, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f      On December 11, 2014, the trial court held a hearing on the State\u2019s motion\n\nto adjudicate.   Colson pleaded \u201cTrue\u201d to the violations alleged by the State,\n\nwithout an agreed recommendation on punishment. Colson presented testimony\n\nfrom seven mitigation witnesses, including himself. During testimony by Ms.\n\nJones, the following exchange transpired between counsel and the trial court judge:\n\n             Counsel:     I explained to you what Mr. Colson is facing if the\n                          judge adjudicates him guilty, a minimum of 180\n                          days. What would you say to the judge as to why\n                          she should exercise her discretion and do\n                          something other than adjudicate him guilty and\n                          sentence him to \u2013\n\n             Court:       Please don\u2019t have these folks think that I have any\n                          discretion at all in this matter.\n\n             Counsel:     Okay.\n\n             Court:       So, I don\u2019t want them to leave here today believing\n                          the Court has some discretion in this matter, based\n                          on the situation and the law.\n\n             Counsel:     Okay.\n                          Okay. Why would you ask the Court not to send\n                          him to jail for 180 days.\n\n             Witness:     I think it would . . .\n\nUltimately, the trial court found the allegations in the motion to adjudicate true and\n\nassessed punishment of seven months\u2019 confinement in state jail.\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f                                     Discussion\n\n      In his sole point of error, Colson contends that the trial court judge failed to\n\nconsider potential alternative dispositions due to her mistaken understanding of the\n\napplicable law. In particular, Colson contends that the record reflects that the trial\n\ncourt incorrectly believed that she had no choice other than to impose a minimum\n\nsentence of 180 days\u2019 confinement.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      Colson asserts that because the \u201cjudge was proceeding from an erroneous\n\nlegal assumption as to the options available,\u201d the underlying issue is a question of\n\nlaw and reviewable de novo. Though Colson urges de novo review, in arguing that\n\nthe trial court failed to consider the full range of punishment, Colson presents a due\n\nprocess issue. See e.g., Grado v. State, 445 S.W.3d 736, 739 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2014); State v. Hart, 342 S.W.3d 659, 672\u201374 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2011, pet. ref\u2019d). Due process requires trial judges to be neutral and detached in\n\nassessing punishment. Brumit v. State, 206 S.W.3d 639, 645 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2006). A defendant is denied his due process rights when a trial court arbitrarily\n\nrefuses to consider the entire range of punishment. Id.\n\n      Absent a clear showing to the contrary, we must presume that the trial court\n\njudge knows the law and applied the law in a fair and impartial manner. Id.; Hart,\n\n342 S.W.3d at 673; see also Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 653 (1990) (\u201cTrial\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fjudges are presumed to know the law and to apply it in making their decisions.\u201d),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002). Explicit\n\nevidence that the trial court considered the full range of punishment indicates an\n\nabsence of bias. Id. The absence of statements in the record suggesting the court\n\nconsidered something less than the full range of punishment and the hearing of\n\nextensive evidence before assessment of punishment might also indicate an\n\nabsence of bias. Id.\n\nB.    Applicable Law\n\n      In order \u201cfor a trial court to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the guilt of a\n\ndefendant who was on community supervision, \u2018both the motion to revoke and\n\ncapias for arrest must be issued prior to the termination of the probationary\n\nperiod.\u2019\u201d Ex parte Moss, 446 S.W.3d 786, 791 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (quoting\n\nGuillot v. State, 543 S.W.2d 650, 652 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976)); see also TEX.\n\nCODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.12 \u00a7 5(h) (West Supp. 2015). A trial court can\n\nextend deferred-adjudication community supervision for a state jail felony as\n\nnecessary, up to a term of 10 years. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.15 \u00a7 5(a)\n\n(West Supp. 2015); Garrett v. State, 377 S.W.3d 697, 704\u201308 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2012). However, it cannot do so once the probationary period expires. TEX. CODE\n\nCRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.12 \u00a7 22(c); id. \u00a7 5(a) (providing that the extension of\n\ndeferred-adjudication community supervision be regulated by art. 42.12, sec. 22);\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\fsee also Ex parte Moss, 446 S.W.3d at 791 (construing art. 42.12, sec. 5(h) as a\n\ncodification of the judicially-fashioned rule allowing limited continuing\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate guilt so long as a motion to adjudicate was filed and\n\ncapias issued during probationary period); Arrieta v. State, 719 S.W.2d 393, 395\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1986, pet. ref\u2019d) (\u201c[Art.42.12] does not grant the trial\n\ncourt the power to amend or modify probation once the probation period has\n\nexpired\u201d).\n\n      Upon an adjudication of guilt, a state jail felony is punishable by\n\nconfinement in a state jail for a term of 180 days to two years. TEX. PENAL CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 12.35 (West 2014). In the alternative, a court may punish a defendant\n\nconvicted of a state jail felony by imposing the confinement permissible as\n\npunishment for a Class A misdemeanor, which results in a fine not to exceed\n\n$4,000, confinement in jail for a term not to exceed one year, or both. TEX. PENAL\n\nCODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 12.44(a) (West 2014); id. \u00a7 12.21 (West 2014). In either case,\n\npursuant to article 42.12, \u201c[a] court assessing punishment after an adjudication of\n\nguilt of a defendant charged with a state jail felony may suspend the imposition of\n\nthe sentence and place the defendant on community supervision or may order the\n\nsentence to be executed, regardless of whether the defendant has previously been\n\nconvicted of a felony.\u201d TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.12 \u00a7 5(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\fC.    Analysis\n\n      Colson was charged with and pleaded guilty to the state jail felony of theft\n\nby check. Colson\u2019s original two-year term of deferred-adjudication community\n\nsupervision was ordered on October 5, 2004, and therefore expired in\n\nOctober 2006. See Whitson v. State, 429 S.W.3d 632, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014)\n\n(explaining that in calculating the end date of deferred-adjudication community\n\nsupervision, the term includes the day that supervision is ordered and excludes the\n\nanniversary date).    On June 20, 2006\u2014during Colson\u2019s term of deferred-\n\nadjudication community supervision\u2014the State moved to adjudicate guilt and a\n\ncapias issued for Colson\u2019s arrest. Though the term of supervision had ended by the\n\ntime of his arrest, the trial court retained jurisdiction for the limited purpose of\n\nadjudicating Colson\u2019s guilt. Ex parte Donaldson, 86 S.W.3d 231, 232 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002) (per curium) (\u201cWe have long held that a trial court has jurisdiction to\n\nhear a motion to revoke . . . as long as the motion was filed, and a warrant or capias\n\nproperly issued, during the probationary period.\u201d).\n\n      While the trial court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate Colson\u2019s guilt, the\n\ncourt had no authority to extend or modify the original term of deferred-\n\nadjudication community supervision because it had expired. TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC. ANN. art. 42.12 \u00a7 22(c); Arrieta, 719 S.W.2d at 395 (\u201c[Art. 42.12] does not\n\ngrant the trial court the power to amend or modify probation once the probation\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fperiod has expired\u201d); Ex parte Lewis, 934 S.W.2d 801, 803 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1996, no pet.) (holding that trial court had no jurisdiction to enter\n\nmodification order extending community supervision after term of supervision had\n\nexpired). Although Colson argues on appeal that the filing of the motion to\n\nadjudicate in July 2006 should toll the expiration of the term of community\n\nsupervision, the Court of Criminal Appeals resolved long ago that the filing of the\n\nmotion to adjudicate does not toll the running of a term of supervision. Nicklas v.\n\nState, 530 S.W.2d 537, 541 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975) (rejecting State\u2019s argument\n\nthat filing of a motion to revoke probation and issuance of warrant tolls running of\n\nprobationary period); see also Arrieta, 719 S.W.2d at 395 (concluding that timely\n\nfiling of motion to revoke probation \u201cdoes not toll the running of the probationary\n\nperiod, and in fact probation continues to run and may expire\u201d); Hunter v. State,\n\n640 S.W.2d 656, 659 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 1982, pet. ref\u2019d) (\u201cA motion to revoke\n\nand capias do not toll the running of the probationary period.\u201d). Accordingly,\n\nColson\u2019s original two-year term of deferred-adjudication community supervision\n\ncontinued to run after the State filed the motion to adjudicate, and the authority of\n\nthe trial court to continue or modify Colson\u2019s supervision expired at the end of that\n\ntwo-year term. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.12 \u00a7 22(c). We conclude\n\nthat, contrary to Colson\u2019s suggestion, the trial court could not have extended his\n\ndeferred-adjudication community supervision.\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      Colson contends that the trial court incorrectly believed that she had no\n\navailable alternative dispositions other than sentencing Colson to at least 180 days\u2019\n\nconfinement. In support, Colson relies on the following exchange:\n\n             Counsel:     I explained to you what Mr. Colson is facing if the\n                          judge adjudicates him guilty, a minimum of 180\n                          days. What would you say to the judge as to why\n                          she should exercise her discretion and do\n                          something other than adjudicate him guilty and\n                          sentence him to \u2013\n\n             Court:       Please don\u2019t have these folks think that I have any\n                          discretion at all in this matter.\n\n             Counsel:     Okay.\n\n             Court:       So, I don\u2019t want them to leave here today believing\n                          the Court has some discretion in this matter, based\n                          on the situation and the law.\n\n(emphasis added). Relying on this exchange, Colson contends that the trial court\n\njudge believed \u201cshe did not have any discretion to take a step other than sending\n\nColson to a state jail upon finding the allegations of supervision violations to be\n\ntrue.\u201d In so doing, Colson reads too much into this ambiguous exchange. Cf.\n\nGrado, 445 S.W.3d at 738 (concluding that trial court violated defendant\u2019s right to\n\nbe sentenced after consideration of entire punishment range where record showed\n\nthat trial court expressly accepted the State\u2019s erroneous assertion that a 10 year\n\nminimum applied and admonished defendant accordingly). The exchange could be\n\ninterpreted as correctly stating that the trial court judge lacked discretion to avoid\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fadjudicating Colson guilty because he admitted the alleged violations. Indeed,\n\nimmediately following the exchange, counsel reframed his question to ask the\n\nwitness why the trial court should exercise discretion in sentencing: \u201cWhy would\n\nyou ask the Court not to send him to jail for 180 days?\u201d; and the trial court judge\n\nnotably did not restate her request that witnesses not be given the impression that\n\nshe had some discretion in the matter. Thus, viewed in its entirety and coupled\n\nwith the well-settled principle that we must assume the trial court judge knows the\n\nlaw, we conclude that a reasonable reading of the exchange reflects that the trial\n\ncourt judge understood that she had no discretion to avoid an adjudication of\n\nColson\u2019s guilt, but that she did have discretion in determining his sentence upon an\n\nadjudication of guilt.   See Jenkins v. State, No. 05\u201314\u201300195\u2013CR, 2015 WL\n\n3522813, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas June 3, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op., not\n\ndesignated for publication) (though trial court judge mistakenly believed appellant\n\noriginally pleaded to a 10 year sentence, stated on record that he did not believe\n\nappellant had done anything on probation to justify reducing that sentence, and\n\nrevoked probation and sentenced appellant to 10 years\u2019 confinement, record did\n\nnot show that trial court refused to consider full range of punishment available).\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that there is no indication in the record that\n\nthe trial court judge erroneously believed that she had no discretion with regard to\n\nsentencing following an adjudication of guilt. Brumit, 206 S.W.3d at 645 (absence\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fof comments suggesting trial court considered something less than full range of\n\npunishment indicates absence of bias, thereby supporting presumption that trial\n\ncourt\u2019s actions were correct).\n\n      The sentencing options available to the trial court included a sentence within\n\nthe prescribed punishment for a state jail felony or a Class A misdemeanor, and\n\nonce ordered, the sentence could be executed or suspended in favor of community\n\nsupervision. The trial court imposed a sentence within the available range. There\n\nis no clear indication in the record to overcome our presumption that the trial court\n\njudge understood the applicable law and applied it in a fair and impartial manner in\n\ndetermining Colson\u2019s sentence. See id. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s decision to sentence Colson within the statutory range for a state jail felony\n\nand to order that the sentence be executed.
