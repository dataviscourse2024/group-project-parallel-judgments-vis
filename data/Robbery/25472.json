Finding no\n\n      error, we affirm.\n\n\n[2]   Rubalcada and two accomplices, Vincent Moreno and Roy Nunez, formed a\n\n      plot to rob Brian Jamison in a fake drug deal. The three accomplices told\n\n      Jamison that they would give him fifty pounds of marijuana in exchange for\n\n      $25,000. At the transaction, Rubalcada and Moreno entered Jamison\u2019s vehicle,\n\n      saying that they needed to count the money. Instead, Rubalcada shot Jamison\n\n      in the head, and Rubalcada and Moreno ran away with the cash.\n\n\n[3]   Rubalcada was found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery, and\n\n      felony murder, and the trial court sentenced him to consecutive terms of fifteen\n\n      years and sixty years for the conspiracy count and the murder count,\n\n      respectively. Our Supreme Court affirmed his convictions on direct appeal.\n\n      Rubalcada v. State, 731 N.E.2d 1015 (Ind. 2000).\n\n\n[4]   On May 7, 2012, Rubalcada filed a petition for post-conviction relief, arguing\n\n      that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. II\n\n      p. 17-23. He claimed that his public defender should have used Nunez as a\n\n      witness and that counsel would not allow him to testify in his own defense.\n\n      After Rubalcada supplemented his petition with an affidavit and the State filed\n\n      its response, the post-conviction court denied the petition on February 24, 2016.\n\n      Rubalcada now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 82A01-1605-PC-1180| February 14, 2017   Page 2 of 5\n\f[5]   A claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel requires a showing that: (1)\n\n      counsel\u2019s performance was deficient by falling below an objective standard of\n\n      reasonableness based on prevailing professional norms; and (2) counsel\u2019s\n\n      performance prejudiced the defendant such that \u201c\u2018there is a reasonable\n\n      probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\n      proceeding would have been different.\u2019\u201d Davidson v. State, 763 N.E.2d 441, 444\n\n      (Ind. 2002) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)). \u201cA\n\n      reasonable probability arises when there is a \u2018probability sufficient to undermine\n\n      confidence in the outcome.\u2019\u201d Grinstead v. State, 845 N.E.2d 1027, 1031 (Ind.\n\n      2006) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). \u201cFailure to satisfy either of the two\n\n      prongs will cause the claim to fail.\u201d Gulzar v. State, 971 N.E.2d 1258, 1261 (Ind.\n\n      Ct. App. 2012). However, \u201c[i]f we can easily dismiss an ineffective assistance\n\n      claim based upon the prejudice prong, we may do so without addressing\n\n      whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d Baer v. State, 942 N.E.2d 80, 91\n\n      (Ind. 2011). \u201cIndeed, most ineffective assistance of counsel claims can be\n\n      resolved by a prejudice inquiry alone.\u201d French v. State, 778 N.E.2d 816, 824\n\n      (Ind. 2002).\n\n\n[6]   Even if we were to accept Rubalcada\u2019s allegations regarding his attorney as\n\n      true, Rubalcada has failed to establish that he suffered any prejudice. Although\n\n      he never clearly specifies what testimony either he or Nunez would have\n\n      provided, he argued at his sentencing hearing that, while he was involved in the\n\n      robbery, it was Moreno who pulled the trigger. He repeats in his appellate brief\n\n      that Nunez \u201cwould have testified that Rubalcada was not the shooter.\u201d\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 82A01-1605-PC-1180| February 14, 2017   Page 3 of 5\n\f      Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 4. Even if Nunez and Rubalcada had testified in exactly this\n\n      way, and the jury found them both perfectly credible, Rubalcada would have\n\n      been found guilty of committing precisely the same offenses for which he was\n\n      convicted. See Ind. Code \u00a7 35-42-1-1(2) (1999) (person is guilty of murder if he\n\n      \u201ckills another human being while committing . . . robbery\u201d); Layman v. State, 42\n\n      N.E.3d 972, 977 (Ind. 2015) (explaining that \u201cfelony murder statute may also\n\n      apply equally when, in committing any of the designated felonies, the felon,\n\n      although not the killer, reasonably should have foreseen that his felonious\n\n      conduct would result in the \u2018mediate or immediate cause\u2019 of the victim\u2019s\n\n      death\u201d) (quoting Palmer v. State, 704 N.E.2d 124, 126 (Ind. 1999)). Rubalcada\n\n      cannot show that he suffered any prejudice because his sought-after testimony\n\n      confirms his guilt.\n\n\n[7]   Rubalcada also argues, for the first time on appeal, that his trial counsel should\n\n      have objected to a statement allegedly made by the prosecutor during the\n\n      sentencing phase of the trial. It is well established that \u201c[i]ssues not raised in\n\n      the petition for post-conviction relief may not be raised for the first time on\n\n      post-conviction appeal.\u201d Allen v. State, 749 N.E.2d 1158, 1171 (Ind. 2001).\n\n      Accordingly, this final argument is waived.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          We also note that Rubalcada has not presented any evidence regarding what the prosecutor said.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 82A01-1605-PC-1180| February 14, 2017              Page 4 of 5\n\f[8]   The judgment of the post-conviction court is affirmed.\n\n\n      Mathias, J., and Pyle, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 82A01-1605-PC-1180| February 14, 2017   Page 5 of 5\n\f",
