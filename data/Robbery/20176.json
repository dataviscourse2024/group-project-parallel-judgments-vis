V. HAMMOND, JUDGE PRESIDING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant Patrick Steve Sanchez was charged with the offense of burglary of a\r\nhabitation.  See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) (West 1994).  Sanchez filed a motion to\r\nsuppress evidence of stolen items, claiming they were seized in violation of his constitutional\r\nrights.  Following a hearing at which both the arresting officer and appellant testified, the trial\r\ncourt overruled appellant's motion.  Sanchez subsequently entered into a negotiated plea agreement\r\nwith the State for a reduced theft charge and was assessed twenty-three months' confinement in\r\na state jail facility.  However, Sanchez reserved his right to appeal the trial court's denial of his\r\nmotion to suppress.  After conducting a de novo review, we conclude that the trial court erred in\r\noverruling appellant's motion to suppress.  We will reverse and remand the cause to the trial\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn a single point of error, appellant claims the trial court abused its discretion in\r\noverruling his motion to suppress.  At the suppression hearing, Lampasas County Sheriff's Deputy\r\nMitchell Martin testified that he had received information from a confidential informant that\r\nSanchez had been involved in several burglaries in the area and was currently in possession of\r\nsome of the stolen property.  Deputy Martin went to Sanchez's residence without a warrant and\r\nrequested permission to search the residence and surrounding area.  Sanchez refused to sign a\r\nsearch consent form, but gave the deputy his verbal consent to search the residence.  In Sanchez's\r\npresence, the deputy noticed some kitchen flatware with a distinctive pattern and some other items\r\nthat matched the description of property reported stolen from the home of Glen Oliver.  Deputy\r\nMartin did not take possession of any items at that time, but requested that appellant accompany\r\nhim to the Sheriff's office for further questioning.  Upon arriving at the Sheriff's office, Sanchez\r\nwas read the Miranda warnings, questioned, and subsequently arrested for burglary of the Oliver\r\nresidence.  Deputy Martin's testimony indicates that the questioning took no longer than one hour.\r\n\r\n\tAfter placing Sanchez in jail, Deputy Martin returned to Sanchez's residence and\r\ncontinued to search for stolen items.  At the suppression hearing, Deputy Martin testified that he\r\nbelieved Sanchez's initial verbal consent to search extended to the second search because Sanchez\r\nhad not revoked his consent.  However, the deputy admitted that he did not inform Sanchez of his\r\nintent to return and search further, and acknowledged that he did not obtain a search warrant even\r\nthough there was adequate time to do so and a judge available.  While at Sanchez's residence the\r\nsecond time, Deputy Martin summoned Glen Oliver, who was able to identify some of the stolen\r\nproperty as his.  The stolen property was seized by Deputy Martin and eventually used to negotiate\r\nthe plea bargain agreement with Sanchez.\r\n\r\n\tAt the suppression hearing, Sanchez testified that he gave Deputy Martin verbal\r\nconsent to search his residence the first time, but that he did not give consent for the second search\r\nthat took place while he was in jail.  Sanchez stated that he did not revoke his consent because the\r\nsubject of another search did not come up, and that he did not even learn about the second search\r\nuntil \"a couple of months later.\"  Deputy Martin admitted that he did not ask Sanchez for his\r\nconsent to conduct the second search.\r\n\r\n\tThe State's attorney acknowledged at the hearing that Sanchez's arrest may have\r\nbeen illegal, but argued that any illegality in the arrest should not taint the second search because\r\nof Sanchez's prior verbal consent.  Sanchez's attorney argued that there were two separate\r\nsearches, not a continuation of a search, and that Sanchez did not consent to the second warrantless\r\nsearch.  The trial court overruled Sanchez's motion to suppress, and the case was placed on the\r\njury docket.  Sanchez then pleaded guilty to theft in exchange for a reduced jail sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe United States and Texas constitutions protect citizens from unreasonable\r\nsearches and seizures.  U.S. Const. Amend. IV; Tex. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9; see Kolb v. State, 532\r\nS.W.2d 87, 89 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976).  A warrantless search or seizure is per se unreasonable,\r\nsubject to a few well-defined and limited exceptions.  See United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705,\r\n717 (1984).  One of the specifically established exceptions to the warrant requirement is a search\r\nconducted with consent.  See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973); Kolb, 532\r\nS.W.2d at 89.  The protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment and the Texas Constitution\r\nmay be waived by an individual voluntarily consenting to a search.  See Paprskar v. State, 484\r\nS.W.2d 731, 737 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).  The burden is on the State to show by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that consent was freely given, and that the consent was positive and\r\nunequivocal.  See Roth v. State, 917 S.W.2d 292, 300 (Tex. App.--Austin 1995, no pet.).\r\n\r\n\tFollowing the lead of the United States Supreme Court, the Texas Court of\r\nCriminal Appeals has held that the amount of deference a reviewing court affords to a trial court's\r\nruling on a mixed question of law and fact is determined by which judicial actor is in a better\r\nposition to decide the issue.  See Guzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85, 87 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996)\r\n(citing Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 114 (1985)).  If the issue involves the credibility of a\r\nwitness, thereby making the evaluation of that witness's demeanor important, compelling reasons\r\nexist for allowing the trial court to apply the law to the facts.  See id. (citing Miller, 474 U.S. at\r\n114).  However, if the issue is whether an officer had probable cause to seize a suspect under the\r\ntotality of the circumstances, the trial judge is not in an appreciably better position than the\r\nreviewing court to make that determination.  See id.  Guzman echoed the United States Supreme\r\nCourt's pronouncement that although great weight should be given to the inferences drawn by trial\r\njudges and law enforcement officers, determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause\r\nshould be reviewed de novo on appeal.  See id. (citing Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,\r\n699 (1996)).  \"[T]he legal rules for probable cause and reasonable suspicion acquire content only\r\nthrough application.  Independent review is therefore necessary if appellate courts are to maintain\r\ncontrol of, and to clarify, the legal principles.\"  Guzman, 955 S.W.2d at 87 (quoting Ornelas, 517\r\nU.S. at 697).  In an unpublished majority opinion, the Court of Criminal Appeals vacated and\r\nremanded our opinion in Combest v. State, 953 S.W.2d 453 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997), for\r\nreconsideration under Guzman, thereby expanding the de novo standard of appellate review to\r\nconsent issues in the search and seizure context.  See Combest v. State, No. 1527-97 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. July 15, 1998) (not designated for publication).  Following the Court of Criminal Appeals'\r\nholding in Combest, we now apply de novo review to the consent issue in this case, namely\r\nwhether the trial court erred in determining that Sanchez's initial consent to search in his presence\r\nextended to the second search that took place after he was jailed. (1)\r\n\r\n\tThe State argues that the consent given by Sanchez for Deputy Martin's first search\r\nof his home was sufficient for the second search that took place approximately one hour later while\r\nSanchez was in jail.  We disagree.  It is undisputed that Sanchez consented to the first search. \r\nHowever, the record shows that Sanchez was not told there would be a subsequent search, and he\r\nwas not given the opportunity to revoke his previous consent because he had been placed in jail\r\nby Deputy Martin.  The record also reflects that Sanchez refused to sign the consent form and only\r\nallowed Deputy Martin to search his residence while in his presence.\r\n\r\n\tThe instant case is distinguishable from other cases where courts have found that\r\nan initial voluntary consent to search extended or carried over to a subsequent search.  In Morrison\r\nv. State, 508 S.W.2d 827 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974), the court held that the original consent to\r\nsearch, given by a third party who exercised control over a suspect's residence, could carry over\r\nto a second search of the residence four hours later.  See id. at 829.  However, the court\r\nspecifically reasoned that the consent carried over because the third party returned with the officer\r\nduring the second search.  See id.  Thus, the presence at a second search of a party who gave\r\nconsent for the initial search may imply consent to the second search.  In the instant case, appellant\r\ndid not accompany Deputy Martin on the second search because he had been jailed and did not\r\nknow the search was occurring.  Under such circumstances, it can hardly be said that Sanchez\r\nimpliedly consented to the second search.\r\n\r\n\tHawkins v. State, 968 S.W.2d 382 (Tex. App.--Tyler 1997, pet. denied) is also\r\ndistinguishable.  At a suppression hearing in that case, police officers testified that they arrived\r\nat Hawkins's apartment in response to a telephone call from Hawkins's live-in girlfriend Minchew\r\ncomplaining that he had threatened her and her baby with a shotgun and would not let her retrieve\r\nthe child from the apartment.  The officers testified that when Minchew called, she was extremely\r\nupset and begged them to go with her to get her child.  When the officers arrived, Minchew\r\nentered the apartment and they heard her arguing with Hawkins.  At that point, the officers entered\r\nand observed Hawkins pointing an illegal sawed-off shotgun at them, which caused them to exit\r\nquickly.  Another officer arrived and convinced Hawkins to release Minchew and the baby.  Two\r\nhours later, the officers returned with reinforcements and negotiated with Hawkins to surrender. \r\nDuring the negotiations, some of the officers were able to see through an open window and\r\nobserve Hawkins holding the illegal shotgun.  After Hawkins surrendered, the officers entered the\r\napartment and retrieved the shotgun.  See Hawkins, 968 S.W.2d at 383-84.\r\n\r\n\tThe trial court denied Hawkins's motion to suppress evidence of the illegal shotgun. \r\nOn appeal, the State argued that the consent given by Minchew for the first entry into the\r\napartment carried over to the second entry after Hawkins surrendered.  See id. at 384.  The court\r\nof appeals noted that although Minchew did not accompany the officers on their return to the\r\napartment to arrest Hawkins, there was testimony that she called for his arrest, informed the police\r\nthat there was a warrant out for his arrest, and pressed charges against him.  See id. at 385. \r\nAccording to the testimony of the police officers, she did nothing to revoke her consent to enter\r\nthe apartment.  Therefore, the court held that Minchew's consent carried over to the second entry\r\ninto the apartment and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to\r\nsuppress.  See id.\r\n\r\n\tHawkins is distinguishable from the present case.  It was Hawkins's live-in\r\ngirlfriend who gave consent for the original entry after Hawkins had threatened her with a\r\nshotgun.  She and her baby were later released by Hawkins into police custody and taken to the\r\npolice station.  Absent a revocation of that consent, it was reasonable for the police officers to\r\npresume that her consent carried over to allow them to retrieve the illegal shotgun after they had\r\nnegotiated Hawkins's surrender.  In the present case, the original consent was given by appellant\r\nhimself; Deputy Martin admitted that he did not ask appellant's girlfriend for her consent when\r\nhe returned alone to conduct a second search of appellant's residence.  There can be no implied\r\ncontinuation of consent, as in Hawkins, because here there was no comparable situation where one\r\nof two cohabitants requests the police to enter their residence to intervene in a violent domestic\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\n\tThis is also not a case in which the \"exigent circumstances\" exception to the\r\nwarrant requirement could apply.  In Brown v. State, 475 S.W.2d 938 (Tex. Crim. App. 1971),\r\nthe court extended the defendant's original consent to search to a second search twelve hours later\r\nwhen the officers returned with the defendant's uncle to obtain evidence that the defendant had\r\nmurdered his parents in the home.  After discussing the \"exigent circumstances\" exception, the\r\ncourt ruled it was not an illegal search and seizure because it occurred during an investigation into\r\na pair of unsolved homicides that took place in a rural home approximately fifteen miles from the\r\nsheriff's office.  See id. at 949-950.  In the case at bar, Deputy Martin was not investigating a\r\nhomicide.  He admitted that he had time to procure a warrant.  Appellant was in jail and unable\r\nto flee, and there was no evidence that the stolen property was about to be removed from his\r\nresidence or destroyed.  No exigent circumstances were present to justify the warrantless search.\r\n\r\n\tDeputy Martin testified that he did not obtain consent for the second search of\r\nSanchez's residence from either Sanchez or his girlfriend; instead, he placed Sanchez in jail and\r\nconducted the second search without a warrant and without consent.  Based on these facts, the\r\nState did not meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that appellant's initial\r\nverbal consent carried over to the second search during which the items at issue were seized. \r\nTherefore, the trial court erred in admitting evidence from the warrantless search.  Sanchez's sole\r\npoint of error is sustained.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t                                                                        \r\n\r\n\tBea Ann Smith, Justice\r\n\r\nBefore Justices Powers, Kidd and B. A. Smith\r\n\r\nReversed and Remanded\r\n\r\nFiled:   December 17, 1998\r\n\r\nPublish\r\n1.        Although appellant's version of the facts differs from Deputy Martin's in that appellant\r\nclaims he was taken to the sheriff's office twice, both before and after the consensual search, this\r\ndiscrepancy is unrelated to the consent issue in this case and both witnesses agree on the relevant\r\nfacts pertaining to the second search.  Because our analysis does not turn on the credibility of\r\neither witness, the discrepancy does not affect our decision to apply the de novo standard of review\r\nto this case in light of Combest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n court\r\nof appeals noted that although Minchew did not accompany the officers on their return to the\r\napartment to arrest Hawkins, there was testimony that she called for his arrest, informed the police\r\nthat there was a warrant out for his arrest, and pressed charges against him.  See id. at 385. \r\nAccording to the testimony of the police officers, she did nothing to revoke her consent to enter\r\nthe apartment.  Therefore, the court held that Minchew's consent carried over to the second entry\r\ninto the apartment and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to\r\nsuppress.  See id.\r\n\r\n\tHawkins is distinguishable from the present case.  It was Hawkins's live-in\r\ngirlfriend who gave consent for the original entry after Hawkins had threatened her with a\r\nshotgun.  She and her baby were later released by Hawkins into police custody and taken to the\r\npolice station.  Absent a revocation of that consent, it was reasonable for the police officers to\r\npresume that her consent carried over to allow them to retrieve the illegal shotgun after they had\r\nnegotiated Hawkins's surrender.
