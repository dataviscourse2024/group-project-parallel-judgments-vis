RILEY,\nJUDGE\n                                 OPINION\n\f       Petitioner, Edmund George Zagorski, appeals from the dismissal of his post-\n\nconviction relief petition. He was previously convicted of two (2) counts of first degree\n\nmurder and sentenced to death by electrocution. Zagorski contends the trial court\n\nerred in dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief and presents to this Court the\n\nfollowing issues for review:\n\n       (1) whether the jury charge on the \u201cheinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d\n       aggravating circumstance was unconstitutional;\n\n       (2) whether he received effective assistance of counsel regarding the\n       motion to suppress his statements;\n\n       (3) whether he received effective assistance of counsel due to the failure\n       of counsel to present mitigating evidence at his sentencing hearing;\n\n       (4) whether the trial court\u2019s denial of certain expert services and the\n       failure of trial counsel to request other expert services violated his\n       constitutional rights; and\n\n       (5) whether the state withheld exculpatory evidence from trial counsel.\n\nFinding that the petition for post-conviction relief was properly dismissed, we AFFIRM\n\nthe judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n\n       In 1984, petitioner was convicted by a jury in Robertson County of two (2)\n\ncounts of premeditated first degree murder. He was sentenced in both cases to death\n\nby electrocution. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal by the\n\nTennessee Supreme Court. State v. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d 808 (Tenn. 1985). His\n\npetition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied on June\n\n30, 1986.\n\n       Petitioner\u2019s original petition for post-conviction relief was filed in 1987. An\n\namended petition was filed in 1989. The actual hearing on the petition for post-\n\nconviction relief was in November 1995 and January 1996.1                 The petition was\n\ndismissed by order entered April 19, 1996. Notice of appeal was timely filed, and the\n\n\n\n       1\n        The reason for the long delay between the filing of the petition and the actual\nhearing is not apparent from the record.\n\n                                              2\n\fcase was orally argued in this Court on March 19, 1997.\n\n\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n\n\n      It is appropriate to recite the facts as set forth by the Tennessee Supreme Court\n\non direct appeal:\n\n             The evidence shows that on April 5, 1983, the defendant first\n      appeared at the Lakeland Trout farm in Bucksnort in Hickman County,\n      Tennessee. The Trout Farm was managed by defendant's friend, Jimmy\n      Blackwell. The defendant, calling himself \"Jesse Lee Hardin,\" claimed\n      to have been working as a mercenary in Honduras and El Salvador. He\n      was wearing camouflage clothing and was carrying a survival knife, an\n      HK 91 .308 semi-automatic rifle and other weapons and survival gear.\n      Although he claimed to have made as much as $100.00 a day as a\n      mercenary, defendant did not seem to have any money.\n\n              During his stay at the trout farm, defendant met John Dale Dotson\n      and his wife Marsha. Dotson and defendant arranged a marijuana\n      purchase involving them and a third man, Jimmy Porter, who lived in\n      nearby Dickson, Tennessee. According to Marsha Dotson, Porter was\n      to pay $23,000.00 for one hundred pounds of marijuana defendant\n      would arrange to have dropped from an airplane into the woods. Dotson\n      was to receive $10,000.00 from Porter for his part of the deal. (Zagorski\n      in a statement to investigating officers stated that the sale was to be of\n      200 pounds of marijuana at $150.00 per pound). The date of the\n      transaction was to be April 23, 1983.\n\n             At about midnight, on April 21, 1983, an airplane flew very low\n      over the Trout Farm. Zagorski, who was with Blackwell, commented \"It's\n      here,\" and left. Zagorski later told Dotson the marijuana had arrived and\n      was in the woods with a man called Dave; that Dotson and no more\n      than two other men were to meet Zagorski, who would be on foot, at\n      6:00 p.m. at Spot, Tennessee, which was within walking distance of the\n      Trout Farm. Zagorski also told Dotson to come armed.\n\n             On the afternoon of April 23, 1983, Porter and Dotson were\n      together at the Eastside Tavern in Dickson, Tennessee. There Porter\n      showed the tavern operator a bank bag containing cash and a .357\n      Magnum pistol. Dotson and Porter left the tavern in Porter's red Datsun\n      pick-up at about 4:30 p.m. They were never seen alive again.\n\n               Also on April 23, 1983, Zagorski left the trout farm, taking his\n      gear. He had been heard to tell Dotson that he would meet him at 6:00\n      p.m. on the road \"up behind Spot.\" At around 5:30 p.m., Blackwell and\n      his girlfriend heard gunshots from the general area where the defendant\n      had walked into the woods. According to Blackwell, it was not unusual\n      to hear gunshots on a daily basis in that part of Hickman County\n      because of the frequency of deer hunting in the area.\n\n\n            On May 6, 1983, the badly decomposed bodies of Porter and\n      Dotson were discovered in a secluded, wooded area near I-65 in\n      Robertson County. The men had been shot in the chest and abdomen\n      and their throats had been cut.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f       A search of the area turned up a military snake-bite kit, a knife\nscabbard (later identified as Zagorski's), a case for \"Red Specs\" glasses\n(the type worn by Zagorski), six flares, three size \"C\" Duracel flashlight\nbatteries and an ink pen. Officers also found a .308 cartridge on the\nground between the bodies of the victims. Ballistic tests showed that the\ncartridge had been fired from Zagorski's HK 91 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n        An autopsy was performed on the bodies of the victims, but due\nto the advanced stage of decomposition, the time of death of the victims\ncould not be fixed with any degree of certitude. The pathologist stated\nthat the time of death could be any time from a week to a month prior to\nthe time the autopsies were performed. The pathologist also testified\nthat he could not determine whether the victims were shot or cut first, but\nthat the actual cause of death of each of the victims was the gunshot\nwounds. According to the pathologist, neither Porter nor Dotson would\nhave died immediately upon being shot, but they would have lived five\nto seven minutes. The record further shows that at the time of death,\nPorter had a blood alcohol level of .10 and Dotson had a blood alcohol\nlevel of .25.\n\n       Johnny Baggett, who found the bodies, testified that a week to\nten days before at around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m., he had heard gunshots in\nthe area. When questioned closer about the gunshots, he fixed the time\nat around April 25 or 26, 1983.\n\n       At about that time, Zagorski showed up at the home of Rodney\nBruce in Ironton, Ohio, driving Porter's Datson [sic] truck. He also had\nwith him the deceased men's coveralls and Porter's .357 Magnum pistol.\nWhile in Ironton, Zagorski spent large sums of cash on survival gear,\nweapons, horses, a four-wheel drive pick-up, and a motorcycle. At one\npoint he showed Bruce what he said was $25,000.00 in cash. He first\nclaimed he had earned the money working off-shore and later said he\nhad earned it working as a mercenary in South America. He also said\nhe had made a \"quick\" $10,000.00 in Nashville. Zagorski also told Bruce\nand an army surplus dealer that he had lost his knife scabbard.\n\n       On May 26, 1983, Zagorski, armed and wearing a bullet-proof\nvest, was apprehended by Ohio law enforcement officers after a\nshoot-out in which Zagorski rammed a police car and shot a special\ndeputy five times. Over $9,000.00 in cash was found in Zagorski's\nfatigue jacket and suit.\n\n       Zagorski gave different versions of his role in the killings of\nDotson and Porter. When he spoke with police on June 1, 1983, he told\nthem that he and another mercenary in their own vehicle had met\nDotson and Porter near Spot. Two other mercenaries in a third vehicle\nhad joined them as they drove up I-40. When they stopped on I-65 in\nRobertson County, the other mercenaries took Zagorski's rifle, silencer\nand gear and went into the woods with Dotson and Porter. Zagorski was\ninstructed to drive Porter's pick-up to a Welcome Center at the Kentucky\nborder and watch for law enforcement officers. Thirty to forty-five\nminutes later the other mercenaries met him, gave him $5,000.00 and\nPorter's .357 Magnum and returned his rifle and gear. Zagorski then left\nin Porter's pick-up since, he said, it was not unusual to trade cars in a\ndrug deal.\n\n       In statements made on July 27 and August 1, 1983, Zagorski\nclaimed he was hired to kill Porter but that Dotson's death was a\nmistake. He also said that two other men had been hired to kill Porter,\nthat the deaths occurred in Humphreys County and that the bodies were\n\n\n                                    4\n\f       put in plastic bags and carried to Robertson County. Zagorski never\n       admitted killing the men and refused to tell the identities of the other men\n       he claimed were involved. Zagorski told some visitors at the jail that he\n       had only been at the killings to \"blow away\" FBI agents.\n\n               The defense proof was directed toward showing that the killings\n       did not occur in Robertson County. One witness, Ruby Winters, testified\n       that at about 4:00 p.m. on April 23, 1983, she had heard loud music and\n       four shots coming in a wooded area near Spot. Another witness testified\n       as to how the HK 91 rifle fired and how far cartridges were expelled from\n       the gun. This was in contradiction to testimony of state witnesses on\n       the issue.\n\n               The jury found from the evidence that the defendant was guilty of\n       murder in the first degree in killing John Dotson and Jimmy Porter.\n       Implicit in the verdicts was a finding by the jury that the killings occurred\n       in Robertson County, Tennessee. In a separate proceeding, and based\n       upon the testimony introduced during the guilt phase of the trial, the jury\n       imposed the sentence of death on the defendant for each killing on its\n       finding (1) that the murders were committed by the defendant while he\n       was engaged in committing robbery of the victims, (2) that the murders\n       were especially heinous, atrocious or cruel in that they involved torture\n       or depravity of mind, and (3) that there was no mitigating circumstance\n       sufficiently substantial to outweigh the statutory aggravating\n       circumstances found by the jury.\n\nState v. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d at 810-812.\n\n\n\n                  TESTIMONY AT POST-CONVICTION HEARING\n\n\n\n       At the post-conviction relief hearing, testimony was presented by Jeff Blum, an\n\ninvestigator; James E. Walton, one of Zagorski\u2019s trial attorneys; Larry D. Wilks, the\n\nother trial attorney; Ted Emery, Sheriff of Robertson County; and Ronnie Perry, a\n\ndetective with the Robertson County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n       Blum was an investigator in this post-conviction case. He conducted an\n\ninvestigation of petitioner\u2019s background. This included petitioner\u2019s early years and his\n\nrelationship with his family. In substance, Blum found that petitioner had an unhappy\n\nchildhood.\n\n\n\n       Blum also discovered that the petitioner had a prior conviction for receiving and\n\nconcealing stolen property and prior drug convictions. In 1981, the petitioner had\n\nfederal drug charges involving the transportation of drugs across state lines. The\n\npetitioner jumped bond on these charges. The petitioner had not been convicted of\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fany violent crimes.\n\n       James E. Walton, who was trial counsel for the petitioner, testified that he was\n\nappointed to this case. Up until 1982 or early 1983, he was active in criminal work, but\n\nhad never handled a capital case before this one. At the time, Walton had been\n\ninvolved in 15 or 16 first degree murder trials and about 20-25% of his legal practice\n\nwas related to criminal law.\n\n       Larry D. Wilks, co-counsel at trial, had very little criminal law experience.\n\nBecause of his lack of experience, Wilks played a support role in the petitioner\u2019s case.\n\nWilks had worked on one prior murder case.\n\n       Counsel requested that the trial court grant funds for a ballistics expert, but the\n\nmotion was denied. Walton testified that a ballistics expert was sought because\n\ncounsel did not think the location of the spent shells on the ground was consistent with\n\nthe theory that the murders occurred where the bodies were found. The request was\n\ndenied by the trial court. Counsel did secure the services of an Army officer who\n\nsubsequently testified regarding the trajectory of the spent cartridges.\n\n       Counsel also asked for funds to hire an investigator because the events\n\ncovered several states. This motion was also denied. This required counsel to\n\ninvestigate on their own. Counsels\u2019 investigation involved tracking down witnesses the\n\nstate had given them. Counsel traveled to Centerville and the trout farm to interview\n\nwitnesses. They also went to Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia, where the borders\n\nof the three states meet, to ascertain information about the petitioner\u2019s capture.\n\n       Trial counsel were granted funds for a psychiatrist. Trial counsel used these\n\nfunds to hire Dr. Ben Bursten, a forensic psychiatrist. Dr. Bursten examined petitioner\n\napproximately one week before trial. After a phone conversation with Dr. Bursten,\n\ncounsel decided not to call him as a witness. Dr. Bursten advised that there was\n\nnothing he could say on the stand that would help petitioner. Dr. Bursten indicated that\n\nhe would have to testify that the petitioner could be a \u201cmean person.\u201d The forensic\n\nevaluation of the petitioner by Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute also found the\n\npetitioner competent to stand trial.\n\n       Counsels\u2019 primary trial objective was to undercut the state\u2019s theory and create\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fa reasonable doubt. Venue was one of the important issues. At trial, counsel for the\n\npetitioner called three witnesses relating to venue.\n\n         The petitioner was adamant that his attorneys not talk to nor involve his family.\n\nThe petitioner insisted he was not the triggerman and did not want to be convicted of\n\nfirst degree murder. If he were convicted of first degree murder, however, the\n\npetitioner wanted the death penalty and not a life sentence. For this reason counsels\u2019\n\nfocus was aimed primarily at trying to prevent a first degree murder conviction.\n\nPetitioner emphatically instructed counsel not to involve his family, investigate his past,\n\nnor present any mitigating proof in the event of a sentencing hearing.\n\n         Because of their ethical concerns, counsel sought advice from the Board of\n\nProfessional Responsibility. An advisory opinion was received by counsel which\n\nsuggested that the client be fully advised that his desires are in conflict with counsel\u2019s\n\nethical responsibilities. It was further suggested that counsel seek a ruling as to the\n\nclient\u2019s competency to represent himself during that portion of the trial in which the\n\nconflict was imminent, and counsel should seek to withdraw during that portion of the\n\ntrial.\n\n         In the end counsel determined that petitioner\u2019s wishes were paramount, and\n\nthey should abide by his instructions. Accordingly, they did not develop extensive\n\nproof to present at a sentencing hearing in the event of a first degree murder\n\nconviction.\n\n         After the petitioner was convicted, counsel talked with the petitioner. Although\n\nthe petitioner had told counsel not to argue or put on any mitigating proof, trial counsel\n\nconvinced the petitioner to let them at least make an argument.\n\n\n\n         Before the sentencing hearing, there was a bench conference concerning\n\nrequests for jury instructions. Counsel believed the trial court placed limitations on the\n\nmitigating factors that counsel was allowed to discuss during closing argument\n\nbecause the trial court denied their requests for jury instructions on specific mitigating\n\nfactors. Consequently, counsel begged for mercy during closing arguments at the\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       Both attorneys testified that they had good relationships with the petitioner and\n\nmet on a regular basis. Neither had any communication problems with the petitioner.\n\nThe attorneys believed petitioner was competent and fully understood the ramifications\n\nof his decision in desiring the death penalty if convicted of first degree murder.\n\n       Sheriff Emery testified that as part of his investigation, he went to Louisiana,\n\nMichigan, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia. Defense counsel had access to the\n\nresults of Sheriff Emery\u2019s investigation.\n\n       Sheriff Emery obtained a statement from the petitioner when petitioner was in\n\na West Virginia hospital. Sheriff Emery found that the petitioner was alert and seemed\n\nto have no problem communicating with him. When the petitioner rode back to\n\nTennessee with Sheriff Emery, petitioner did not complain about his health. When\n\nSheriff Emery took a second statement on June 1, 1983, the petitioner was alert, he\n\nappeared normal, and his speech was not slurred. Sheriff Emery testified that,\n\naccording to his investigation, no one else was involved in the murders.\n\n       Detective Perry testified that when the petitioner made a statement to him in the\n\njail on July 27, 1983, the petitioner was coherent, spoke well, and could understand\n\nhim. The petitioner did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the\n\ntime. Nor did the petitioner make any complaints about his health at that time.\n\n       Detective Perry also testified that the petitioner was alert, able to speak and\n\nable to understand when he gave the statement on August 1, 1983. The petitioner did\n\nnot appear to be under the influence of an intoxicant and never complained about his\n\nhealth or medical condition on that occasion. The petitioner only complained about\n\nbeing in jail.\n\n\n\n        TRIAL COURT\u2019S FINDINGS DENYING POST-CONVICTION RELIEF\n\n\n\n       The trial court filed a comprehensive Memorandum Opinion denying post-\n\nconviction relief. The trial court\u2019s rulings may be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n                                            A.\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       The court found that the jury charge on \u201cheinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d had been\n\nlitigated on direct appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The trial court found that\n\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court re-weighed the evidence and found no constitutional\n\ninfirmity. State v. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d 808, 814 (Tenn. 1985).\n\n\n\n                                            B.\n\n\n\n       The court found that trial counsel was not ineffective in the handling of the\n\nmotion to suppress petitioner\u2019s statements. The court further noted that the issue was\n\nraised on direct appeal and decided adversely to petitioner. State v. Zagorski, 701\n\nS.W.2d at 812.\n\n\n\n                                            C.\n\n\n\n       The court further concluded that trial counsel was not ineffective in their\n\nrepresentation at the sentencing phase of trial. The court found that petitioner was\n\ncompetent to aid in his own defense and have input into trial determinations. The\n\ncourt found that counsel followed the dictates of their client\u2019s wishes. The court further\n\nfound trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to argue the criminal activity of the\n\nvictims, the petitioner\u2019s youth, or the petitioner\u2019s lack of a violent criminal history.\n\n\n\n\n                                            D.\n\n\n\n       The court ruled that the failure of the trial court to appoint various experts did\n\nnot prejudice the petitioner. The court concluded that although a private investigator\n\nwas not appointed to assist counsel, counsel conducted an extensive and appropriate\n\ninvestigation on their own.      The court found no deficiency with regard to the\n\ninvestigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f                                             E.\n\n\n\n       The court found that certain information relating to the homicides was\n\ndeveloped in other judicial districts and not turned over to the prosecuting District\n\nAttorney General.    Although the court noted the need for the sharing of such\n\ninformation in multiple-jurisdiction cases, the court found that this information would\n\nnot have altered the outcome of the trial.\n\n\n\n                                SCOPE OF REVIEW\n\n\n\n       In post-conviction proceedings, the petitioner must prove the allegations\n\ncontained in his petition by a preponderance of the evidence. Davis v. State, 912\n\nS.W.2d 689, 697 (Tenn. 1995); State v. Kerley, 820 S.W.2d 753, 755 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1991); Oliphant v. State, 806 S.W.2d 215, 218 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). Findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law made by the trial court are given the weight of a jury\n\nverdict; this Court is bound by those findings unless the evidence contained in the\n\nrecord preponderates otherwise. Butler v. State, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899 (Tenn. 1990);\n\nTeague v. State, 772 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1988). This Court may not\n\nreweigh or re-evaluate the evidence or substitute its inferences for those drawn by the\n\ntrial court. Adkins v. State, 911 S.W.2d 334, 341 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). Questions\n\nconcerning the credibility of witnesses and weight and value to be given their testimony\n\nare for resolution by the trial court. Black v. State, 794 S.W.2d 752, 755 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1990).\n\n\n\n                        HEINOUS, ATROCIOUS OR CRUEL\n\n\n\n                           A. Contentions of the Parties\n\n\n\n       The petitioner argues that the jury instruction on the \u201cheinous, atrocious, or\n\ncruel\u201d aggravating factor was unconstitutionally vague because the trial court failed to\n\n\n                                             10\n\finclude the definitions of the terms heinous, atrocious, cruel, torture, and depravity of\n\nmind. The petitioner claims that the jury instruction failed to narrow the class of death-\n\neligible defendants as required by Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 100 S. Ct. 1759,\n\n64 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1980).\n\n       In response, the state contends that because our Supreme Court on direct\n\nappeal construed and interpreted this aggravating circumstance in accordance with the\n\ndefinitions set forth in State v. Williams, 690 S.W.2d 517, 529-30 (Tenn. 1985), the\n\n\u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d aggravating factor was not unconstitutionally vague as\n\napplied to the petitioner\u2019s case. The state further asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nconstruction cured any constitutional defect that may have arisen from the fact that the\n\njury was instructed only in the plain words of the statute.\n\n\n\n                            B. Compliance with Williams\n\n\n\n       In State v. Williams, our Supreme Court noted \u201cthat the court did not instruct the\n\njury concerning the legal significance of the words \u2018heinous,\u2019 \u2018atrocious,\u2019 \u2018cruel,\u2019\n\n\u2018torture,\u2019 or \u2018depravity of mind\u2019 as those terms are used in the aggravating circumstance\n\ndefined in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-2-203(I)(5)(1982). Williams, 690 S.W.2d at 532.\n\nAfter discussion of the legal meanings of these terms, the Court found insufficient\n\nevidence of \u201ctorture\u201d (the victim had been killed first, mutilated second), but possible\n\nevidence of \u201cdepravity of mind\u201d and left the final determination to the jury on remand.\n\nId. at 525-532. The Court found the statute to be constitutional \u201cso long as the\n\nabstract terms employed therein are construed and interpreted as we have done in this\n\nopinion and other opinions of this Court.\u201d Id. at 533.\n\n       In charging the jury in the present case, the trial court did not define any of the\n\nterms in the \u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d aggravating circumstance. Instead, the trial\n\ncourt gave the following instruction:\n\n             No death penalty shall be imposed unless you find unanimously\n       that one or more of the following specified statutory aggravating\n       circumstances has been proven on the trial and/or in the sentencing\n       hearing beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n              The aggravating circumstances relied upon in this case are: the\n\n                                           11\n\f       murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved\n       torture or depravity of mind; the murders were committed while the\n       defendant was engaged in committing robbery of the victims.\n\n\n       State v. Williams was released on May 20, 1985. Although the petitioner\u2019s trial\n\nwas held before Williams was decided, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in his direct\n\nappeal was released six months after Williams. In finding that this aggravating factor\n\nwas properly applied, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n                On considering the evidence properly before the jury in this case,\n       we are convinced that it is sufficient for a rational trial [sic] of fact to find\n       beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant killed John Dotson and\n       Jimmy Porter in Robertson County during the course of a robbery. We\n       are also of the opinion that the finding by the jury that the murders were\n       \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d is in accord with the evidence.\n       See State v.Williams, 690 S.W.2d 517, 529-30 (Tenn. 1985). Although\n       the victims died from gunshot wounds, the defendant also slit their\n       throats, leaving them to bleed to death in the woods. This evidences\n       depravity of mind and is a form of torture. Defendant\u2019s actions were an\n       infliction of gratuitous violence, and needless mutilation of victims who\n       were already helpless from fatal wounds which indicate a depraved state\n       of mind at the time of the killings. We are also of the opinion that the\n       evidence justifies the jury\u2019s finding that there was no mitigating\n       circumstance which would outweigh the statutory aggravating\n       circumstances found by the jury.\n\nState v. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d at 814.\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court decided many cases after Williams in which the\n\ndefinitions of these terms were not included in the instructions to the jury. In these\n\ncases, the Court upheld the use of this aggravator. Significantly, several of these\n\ncases, including the present case, were tried before Williams, but decided after. See\n\ne.g., State v. Barber, 753 S.W.2d 659, 668-69 (Tenn.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 900, 109\n\nS. Ct. 248, 102 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1988); State v. Duncan, 698 S.W.2d 63, 70-71 (Tenn.\n\n1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1031, 106 S. Ct. 1240, 89 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1986). It is also\n\nsignificant that the Supreme Court held in Williams that this aggravator was not\n\nunconstitutionally vague or overbroad. State v. Williams, 690 S.W.2d at 533; see also\n\nState v. Teel, 793 S.W.2d 236, 251 (Tenn.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1007, 111 S. Ct.\n\n571, 112 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1990); State v. Thompson, 768 S.W.2d 239, 252 (Tenn. 1989)\n\n(holding that the language \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d requires, in addition,\n\na finding of \u201ctorture or depravity of mind.\u201d), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1031, 110 S. Ct.\n\n3288, 111 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1990).\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       In Strouth v. State, 755 S.W.2d 819 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1986), this Court cited\n\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal for the proposition that\n\nWilliams was not to be applied retroactively:\n\n              In State v. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d 808 (Tenn.1985), decided six\n       months after Williams, the defendant appealed the imposition of the\n       death penalty based on the same two aggravating circumstances as in\n       the instant case. Citing Williams, 690 S.W.2d at 529-530, but with no\n       comment on the jury instructions, the Court agreed with the jury finding\n       that the murders had been \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\u201d The\n       defendant had slit the victims\u2019 throats after shooting them, and left them\n       \u201cto bleed to death in the woods. This evidence[d] depravity of mind and\n       [was] a form of torture[,]...an infliction of gratuitous violence, and\n       needless mutilation of victims who were already helpless.\u201d 701 S.W.2d\n       at 814. The Court also rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that Tenn.\n       Code Ann. \u00a7 39-2-203(i)(5) was unconstitutionally vague. Id. 701\n       S.W.2d at 816.\n\nId. at 831. The Court found that if the Supreme Court \u201cfound it unnecessary to give\n\nretroactive application of the Williams definitional jury instruction requirement in\n\nZagorski, supra, we conclude that it is likewise unnecessary to do so in this case.\u201d Id.\n\n       Furthermore, the defective jury instruction was cured by the Tennessee\n\nSupreme Court in the direct appeal.         If confronted by an improperly defined\n\naggravating circumstance, the state appellate court may itself determine whether the\n\nevidence supports the existence of the aggravating circumstance as properly defined.\n\nWalton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 110 S. Ct. 3047, 111 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1990). The\n\nTennessee Supreme Court has utilized this method of review. State v. Duncan, 698\n\nS.W.2d at 71. The Tennessee Supreme Court has also found harmless error when\n\nthe trial court erroneously omitted \u201cdepravity of mind\u201d as a part of this aggravating\n\ncircumstance. State v. Bush, ___ S.W.2d ___ (Tenn. 1997). The court concluded that\n\nhad the jury been properly instructed, it would have found \u201cdepravity of mind.\u201d Id.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s contention that his \u201cliberty interest in jury sentencing\u201d precludes a\n\nTennessee appellate court reweighing an aggravating circumstance is without merit.\n\n       Because the Tennessee Supreme Court reviewed the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal\n\nafter the release of its opinion in Williams, and because the Court cited Williams in\n\napproving the jury\u2019s finding that the murders were heinous, atrocious, or cruel, this\n\nCourt is bound by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision on this issue. See Caruthers v. State,\n\n814 S.W.2d 64, 70 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991); Harvey v. State, 749 S.W.2d 478, 479\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f(Tenn. Crim. App. 1987); see also Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-112(a)(1982)(\u201c[a] ground\n\nfor relief is considered \u2018previously determined\u2019 if a court of competent jurisdiction has\n\nruled on the merits after a full and fair hearing.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                             C. Houston Distinguishable\n\n\n\n       In Houston v. Dutton, 50 F.3d 381, 387 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 272\n\n(1995), the federal appellate court held that the same jury instruction as given in this\n\ncase was constitutionally infirm. The case is distinguishable. Our Supreme Court\n\ndecided Houston v. State, 593 S.W.2d 267 (Tenn.) , cert. denied, 449 U.S. 891, 101\n\nS. Ct. 251, 66 L. Ed. 2d 117 (1980), prior to its decision in Williams. Therefore, the\n\nSupreme Court did not apply the subsequent limiting construction of the \u201cheinous,\n\natrocious, or cruel\u201d aggravating circumstance as it did in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal.\n\n       In summary, while the jury instruction on this aggravating circumstance was\n\ndeficient without the limiting definitions of the relevant terms, this Court must presume\n\nthat our Supreme Court cured any constitutional defect by applying a narrowing\n\nconstruction pursuant to Williams, which was cited in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion.\n\nSee State v. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d at 814. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n       INEFFECTIVE COUNSEL - MOTION TO SUPPRESS STATEMENTS\n\n\n\n                            A. Contentions of the Parties\n\n\n\n       The petitioner contends that trial counsel failed to adequately investigate facts\n\nrelating to the statements he made to the police and failed to present important\n\nevidence regarding the circumstances of the petitioner\u2019s statements. Specifically, the\n\npetitioner argues that trial counsel failed to present proof regarding his state of mind,\n\nhis medical condition, the medications he was taking, the effect of his medical\n\nconditions and taking of medications, and the circumstances of his incarceration. If\n\ntrial counsel had presented this proof at the suppression hearing, the petitioner asserts\n\n\n                                            14\n\fthat the trial court would have found that the petitioner\u2019s statements were involuntary\n\nand subject to suppression.\n\n       In response, the state argues the post-conviction court properly held that trial\n\ncounsel litigated the jail conditions, the petitioner\u2019s mental and physical state, and the\n\nvoluntariness of the petitioner\u2019s statements.       The state further argues that the\n\npetitioner has failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the introduction of these\n\nstatements because the Supreme Court held on direct appeal that if the statements\n\nwere admitted in error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of\n\nthe overwhelming evidence of the petitioner\u2019s guilt.\n\n\n\n                                 B. Standards of Review\n\n\n\n       When a petitioner seeks post-conviction relief on the basis of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, he must first establish that the services rendered or the advice\n\ngiven were below \"the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\"\n\nBaxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930, 936 (Tenn. 1975). Second, he must show that the\n\ndeficiencies \"actually had an adverse effect on the defense.\"              Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). There\n\nmust be a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different. Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068; Best v. State,\n\n708 S.W.2d 421, 422 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1985). Should the petitioner fail to establish\n\neither factor, he is not entitled to relief.\n\n       When determining whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, \u201cevery effort\n\n[must] be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the\n\ncircumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from\n\ncounsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 689, 104\n\nS. Ct. 2065. \u201cThus, the fact that a particular strategy or tactic failed or even hurt the\n\ndefense does not, alone, support a claim of ineffective assistance.\u201d Cooper v. State,\n\n847 S.W.2d 521, 528 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992). We must defer to trial strategy and\n\ntactical choices when they are informed ones based upon adequate preparation. Id.\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f         Moreover, on appeal, the findings of fact made by the post-conviction court are\n\nconclusive and will not be disturbed unless the evidence contained in the record\n\npreponderates against them. Rhoden v. State, 816 S.W.2d 56, 60 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1991); Brooks v. State, 756 S.W.2d 288, 289 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1988). The burden\n\nis on the petitioner to show that the evidence preponderates against those findings.\n\nClenny v. State, 576 S.W.2d 12, 14 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S.\n\n947, 99 S. Ct. 2170, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1050 (1979).\n\n\n\n                                C. Our Determinations\n\n\n\n         A pre-trial hearing was held on the motion to suppress the petitioner\u2019s\n\nstatements given on May 28, June 1, July 27, and August 1, 1983. At the hearing, the\n\nstate indicated that it would not attempt to introduce the first statement in its case-in-\n\nchief.\n\n         The last three statements were taken after the petitioner had been moved to the\n\nRobertson County Jail. Although trial counsel argued and cross-examined the state\u2019s\n\nwitnesses concerning the petitioner\u2019s medical condition, his mental condition, and the\n\nconditions of his jail cell, trial counsel did not present any medical records or other\n\nproof. At the end of the hearing, the trial court denied the motion to suppress the\n\npetitioner\u2019s statements.\n\n         As argued by the petitioner, the mental condition of a defendant is a significant\n\nfactor in determining whether a statement was given voluntarily. See State v. Brimmer,\n\n876 S.W.2d 75, 79 (Tenn. 1994).           Whether trial counsel was deficient in not\n\nintroducing medical records need not be decided since petitioner is unable to show\n\nprejudice. Our Supreme Court determined on direct appeal that any error in admitting\n\nthe statements was harmless error in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.\n\nState v. Zagorski, 701 S.W.2d at 812. In order for the petitioner to succeed on an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, there must be a reasonable probability that, but\n\nfor counsel\u2019s error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Strickland\n\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068; Best v. State, 708 S.W.2d at 422.\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fThis question has been answered by our Supreme Court. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n               INEFFECTIVE COUNSEL - SENTENCING HEARING\n\n\n\n                           A. Contentions of the Parties\n\n\n\n       The petitioner asserts that trial counsel was ineffective by (1) failing to\n\ninvestigate and present mitigating proof at the sentencing phase of trial, (2) failing to\n\nfully inform the petitioner of possible mitigating factors and the consequences of his\n\ndecision not to introduce mitigating evidence at sentencing, (3) failing to seek a\n\ncompetency hearing because of the petitioner\u2019s clouded judgment, (4) failing to follow\n\nthe guidelines specified in the Advisory Ethics Opinion which counsel solicited, and (5)\n\nfailing to make an argument of available mitigating factors.\n\n       In response, the state argues that the post-conviction court properly found that\n\ncounsel was not ineffective for abiding by the petitioner\u2019s request that counsel not\n\ninvestigate or present mitigating proof at the sentencing hearing. Moreover, the state\n\nsubmits that counsel was not bound to follow the recommendations in the Advisory\n\nEthics Opinion. Finally, the state argues that even if counsel was ineffective by failing\n\nto investigate and present mitigating proof, the petitioner has failed to show prejudice.\n\n\n\n                           B. General Duties of Counsel\n\n\n\n       In death penalty cases, the sentencer may not be precluded from considering\n\nany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record as a basis for a sentence less than\n\ndeath. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604-05, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 2964-65, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973\n\n(1978) (plurality opinion); see also Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 361, 113 S. Ct.\n\n2658, 2666, 125 L. Ed. 2d 290, reh\u2019g denied, 509 U.S. 941, 114 S. Ct. 15, 125 L. Ed. 2d\n\n767 (1993). The United States Supreme Court has held that mitigating evidence is\n\nrelevant to sentencing hearings and should be heard. See California v. Brown, 479\n\nU.S. 538, 541, 107 S. Ct. 837, 839, 93 L. Ed. 2d 934 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455\n\n\n                                           17\n\fU.S. 104, 113-15, 102 S. Ct. 869, 876-77, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982). However, there is no\n\nlegal requirement and no established practice that the accused must offer evidence\n\nat the penalty phase of a capital trial. State v. Melson, 772 S.W.2d 417, 421 (Tenn.),\n\ncert. denied, 493 U.S. 874, 110 S. Ct. 211, 107 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1989); see also Darden\n\nv. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 184-85, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 2473, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986).\n\nIn fact, counsel has properly seen fit not to offer any evidence at the penalty phase in\n\nmany death penalty cases. State v. Melson, 772 S.W.2d at 421 (citing sixteen cases\n\nheard by the Tennessee Supreme Court including petitioner\u2019s case).\n\n       The extent of investigation required depends critically upon information supplied\n\nby the defendant. Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 795, 107 S. Ct. 3114, 3126, 97\n\nL. Ed. 2d 638 (1987); see also Whitmore v. Lockhart, 8 F.3d 614, 621 (8th Cir.1993).\n\nWhen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain\n\ninvestigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel's failure to pursue those\n\ninvestigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable. Burger, 483 U.S. at 795,\n\n107 S.Ct. at 3126.\n\n       Our Supreme Court recently addressed the duty of counsel to investigate and\n\npresent mitigating evidence in Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363 (Tenn. 1996). In Goad,\n\nthe Court found trial counsel ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence\n\nrelative to Goad\u2019s symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The Court further\n\nfound that Goad was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to present such proof. In\n\ndetermining whether Goad was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient representation, the\n\nCourt set forth several factors to consider:\n\n\n               Where the alleged prejudice under Strickland involves counsel\u2019s\n       failure to present mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a capital\n       trial, several factors are significant. First, courts have analyzed the\n       nature and extent of the mitigating evidence that was available but not\n       presented. Deutscher v. Whitley, 946 F.2d 1443 (9th Cir. 1991);\n       Stephens v. Kemp, 846 F.2d 642 (11th Cir. 1988); Cooper v. State, 847\n       S.W.2d at 532; Atkins v. State, 911 S.W.2d 334 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n       1995). Second, courts have considered whether substantially similar\n       mitigating evidence was presented to the jury in either the guilt or penalty\n       phase of the proceedings. Atkins v. Singletary, 965 F.2d 952 (11th Cir.\n       1992); Clozza v. Murray, 913 F.2d 1092 (4th Cir. 1990); State v. Melson,\n       772 S.W.2d 417, 421 (Tenn. 1989). Finally, the courts have considered\n       whether there was such strong evidence of aggravating factors that the\n       mitigating evidence would not have affected the jury\u2019s determination.\n       Fitzgerald v. Thompson, 943 F.2d 463, 470 (4th Cir. 1991); Elledge v.\n\n\n                                           18\n\f       Dugger, 823 F.2d 1439 (11th Cir. 1987).\n\n\nId. at 371.\n\n\n\n                         C. Attorney - Client Relationship\n\n\n\n       A crucial issue relating to counsel\u2019s performance is the effect, if any, of\n\ndefendant\u2019s emphatic instructions not to prepare for or present mitigating proof in the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial. This appears to be an issue of first impression in\n\nTennessee.\n\n       At the heart of the issue is whether counsel should totally disregard the client\u2019s\n\ndesires as to how the defense should be conducted. Obviously, there are times when\n\ncounsel should not follow the demands of the client. For example, a lawyer should not\n\nfabricate evidence at the request of the client. This is clearly illegal and unethical\n\nconduct. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-16-503; Sup. Ct. Rules, Rule 8, Code of Prof.\n\nResp., DR 7-102(6). However, a client\u2019s request not to present certain kinds of proof\n\nwould not necessarily result in counsel\u2019s committing a crime or unethical conduct.\n\n       A criminal prosecution is directed against the defendant, not counsel. It is in\n\nfact the defendant\u2019s case, not counsel\u2019s. The purpose of a defense lawyer is to assist\n\na defendant in making a defense and to represent the defendant before the court.\n\nState v. Franklin, 714 S.W.2d 252, 262 (Tenn. 1986). Although a client may conduct\n\nhis or her own defense ultimately to his or her detriment, that choice must be honored\n\nout of \u201cthat respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u201d Faretta v.\n\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 806, 834, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2541, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975).\n\nFurthermore, the authority to make decisions generally belongs to the client and, if\n\nmade within the framework of the law, such decisions are binding on counsel. Sup.\n\nCt. Rules, Rule 8, Code of Prof. Resp., EC 7-7.\n\n       Other jurisdictions have confronted the issue of a defendant\u2019s right to direct how\n\na defense should be conducted. In State v. Ali, 329 N.C. 394, 407 S.E.2d 183 (1991),\n\nthe court found no constitutional violation when counsel complied with the wishes of\n\nthe defendant in accepting a juror when counsel suggested otherwise. The court\n\n                                           19\n\ffound that the attorney-client relationship is one based upon principles of agency as\n\nopposed to guardian and ward. Ali, 407 S.E.2d at 189; see also People v. Wilkerson,\n\n123 Ill.App.3d 527, 463 N.E.2d 139 (1984).\n\n        We likewise find that the attorney-client relationship is primarily one of agency.\n\nWhen a competent defendant knowingly and voluntarily chooses a lawful course of\n\nconduct, counsel is ordinarily bound by that decision. If the defense is prejudiced\n\nbecause of a defendant\u2019s choice, a defendant should not later be heard to complain\n\nas to the course the defendant chose. Dukes v. State, 578 S.W.2d 659 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1978); State ex rel. Lea v. Brown, 166 Tenn. 669, 64 S.W.2d 841 (1933).\n\n        Having concluded that counsel is ordinarily bound by the lawful choices of the\n\nclient, we now turn to the specific allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\n\n                        D. Failure to Investigate Mitigating Proof\n\n\n\n        Counsel was hampered in their efforts to do a pre-trial investigation in\n\npreparation of presenting mitigating evidence during a potential sentencing phase of\n\nthe trial. This was primarily because of petitioner\u2019s adamant instructions not to involve\n\nhis family nor present mitigating evidence in the event of a first degree murder\n\nconviction.\n\n\n\n        Petitioner contends that trial counsel would have discovered the following\n\ninformation if they had conducted an adequate investigation for the sentencing phase\n\nof trial:\n\n        Zagorski was born and raised in Tecumseh, Michigan, a small town\n        outside Detroit. Zagorski\u2019s mother and father were both of Polish\n        descent. Zagorski\u2019s mother had only a seventh grade education and\n        had suffered a brain injury when she was one and a half years old. She\n        apparently suffered brain damage and was very difficult to deal with in\n        a lot of different ways.\n\n            Zagorski\u2019s father worked in a low level job at Tecumseh Engines. The\n            family never owned a car, and they had a small house in Tecumseh.\n            They were a lower income family. Zagorski had few if any friends\n            growing up. Zagorski\u2019s mother was very immature and mistreated\n            Zagorski. Zagorski\u2019s father spent little time with him. Growing up,\n            Zagorski developed a stutter and was embarrassed to speak outside the\n            home.\n\n                                             20\n\f       Zagorski is illiterate, having never learned to read or write. Zagorski had\n       a learning disability. Zagorski never received any type of tutors or\n       corrective classes growing up. Zagorski was a very poor student, never\n       graduated from high school and was continuously absent. Zagorski\n       became involved with alcohol and drugs at a very early age.\n\n\n       The failure to fully investigate a defendant\u2019s background in preparation for a\n\npossible death penalty sentencing hearing is ordinarily below the range of competence\n\ndemanded of counsel. See California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 107 S. Ct. 837, 93 L. Ed.\n\n2d 934 (1987); Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363 (Tenn. 1996). However, in this case\n\nthe petitioner had explicitly instructed counsel not to confer with his family and not to\n\noppose the death penalty. Nevertheless, counsel did confer with petitioner\u2019s mother.\n\nFurthermore, counsel had secured the services of Dr. Bursten, a forensic psychiatrist.\n\nAs a result of Dr. Bursten\u2019s examination of petitioner approximately one week before\n\ntrial, Dr. Bursten told counsel he could not help by testifying and would have to testify\n\nthat petitioner could be a \u201cmean person.\u201d The decision not to use such testimony is\n\ncertainly understandable and a strategic choice. Cooper v. State, 847 S.W.2d at 528.\n\n       Most importantly, we need not reach the issue of whether trial counsel was\n\ndeficient in failing to fully investigate defendant\u2019s background if the petitioner does not\n\nmake a sufficient showing of prejudice. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 697,\n\n104 S.Ct. at 2069; Felde v. Butler, 817 F.2d 281 (5th Cir. 1987). There were two\n\nmurders. The jury found two aggravating circumstances in support of the death\n\npenalty; namely, (1) the murders were committed during the perpetration of robbery,\n\nand (2) the murders were especially heinous, atrocious or cruel in that they involved\n\ntorture or depravity of mind. Petitioner has failed to establish prejudice for two\n\nreasons.    Firstly, there is no showing that petitioner would have allowed the\n\nintroduction of such evidence even if it were available. Petitioner was always insistent\n\nnot to involve his family. There is nothing in the record to indicate anything to the\n\ncontrary. Secondly, petitioner has not shown a reasonable probability of a different\n\nresult had the evidence been introduced.           While many people have unhappy\n\nchildhoods, few commit brutal murders.           Strouth v. State, 755 S.W.2d at 827.\n\nConsidering the nature of the background information as compared to the strong\n\naggravating factors, petitioner has failed to show prejudice. Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n\n\n                                            21\n\f697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 371.\n\n\n\n                       E. Failure to Present Mitigating Proof\n\n\n\n       Closely related to the alleged failure to investigate mitigating evidence is\n\npetitioner\u2019s allegation that counsel was ineffective due to their failure to present any\n\nmitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial. As a general rule the\n\nfailure to present relevant mitigating evidence would constitute a deficient performance\n\nby counsel. See Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d at 371. However, the failure to introduce\n\nmitigating evidence does not necessarily indicate ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nBurger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 107 S. Ct. 3114, 97 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1987); State v.\n\nMelson, 772 S.W.2d 417 (Tenn.1989).\n\n       In this instance trial counsel was faced with adamant instructions from a\n\ncompetent client not to present mitigating evidence. In view of counsel\u2019s explanations\n\nto petitioner of the ramifications of his decision, the competence of the petitioner and\n\nhis knowing and voluntary request that no mitigating proof be presented, counsel was\n\nnot deficient in following petitioner\u2019s request. It is not outside the range of competent\n\n\n\n\nattorney actions to fail to present mitigating evidence when the defendant adamantly\n\nendorses that position. Linda E. Carter, Maintaining Systemic Integrity In Capital\n\nCases: The Use of Court- Appointed Counsel to Present Mitigating Evidence When the\n\nDefendant Advocates Death, 55 TENN . L. REV . 95, 140 (1987).            To satisfy the\n\nConstitution, counsel must function as an advocate for the defendant, as opposed to\n\na mere friend of the court. United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 80\n\nL. Ed. 2d 657 (1984).\n\n       The United States Supreme Court has recognized the right of a mentally\n\ncompetent defendant to forego appellate review. Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U.S. 731,\n\n110 S. Ct. 2223, 109 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1990); Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 110\n\nS. Ct. 1717, 109 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1990); Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012, 97 S. Ct. 436, 50\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\fL. Ed. 2d 632 (1976). If a competent defendant is able to waive the right of appellate\n\nreview of a death sentence, we see no reason why a competent defendant may not\n\nalso waive the right to present mitigating evidence. Singleton v. Lockhart, 962 F.2d\n\n1315, 1322 (8th Cir. 1992). Counsel is not ineffective at the sentencing phase of a\n\ncapital murder trial when counsel follows the defendant\u2019s request not to fight the death\n\npenalty. Autry v. McKaskle, 727 F.2d 358 (5th Cir. 1984); Clark v. State, 613 So. 2d\n\n412 (Fla. 1992), cert. denied 114 S. Ct. 114 (1993).\n\n       The post-conviction court found that the petitioner was competent when he\n\nmade the request to counsel not to present mitigating proof. The evidence does not\n\npreponderate against this finding. In light of petitioner\u2019s knowing and voluntary request\n\nthat counsel not present any mitigating proof, we find counsel was not ineffective by\n\nfailing to present mitigating proof. Singleton v. Lockhart, 962 F.2d at 1322.\n\n       Furthermore, as previously stated, petitioner has not shown prejudice.\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069; Goad v. State, 938\n\nS.W.2d at 371. There has not been a showing of a reasonable probability that the\n\nsuggested mitigating circumstances would have altered the outcome of the\n\nproceeding. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 699-700.\n\n\n\n\n                F. Informing Client of Consequences of Actions\n\n\n\n       Petitioner next contends he was not adequately informed as to mitigation proof.\n\nCertainly, a meaningful discussion with the client is the \u201ccornerstone of effective\n\nassistance of counsel.\u201d Martin v. Maggio, 711 F.2d 1273, 1280 (5th Cir. 1983) (citing\n\nGaines v. Hopper, 575 F.2d 1147, 1149-50 (5th Cir. 1978)). However, the record does\n\nnot support petitioner\u2019s contention. Petitioner was properly advised by counsel at all\n\nstages of the proceedings. Petitioner understood the ramifications of his actions. This\n\nissue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                    G. Failure to Request Competency Hearing\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\f       Petitioner contends counsel was deficient in failing to request a competency\n\nhearing regarding his decision to forego mitigating proof. Petitioner had been found\n\ncompetent by Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute. He was also found to be\n\ncompetent by Dr. Bursten, the psychiatrist retained by petitioner\u2019s counsel. Dr.\n\nBursten\u2019s findings were based upon an examination approximately one week before\n\ntrial. Counsel had no problem communicating with petitioner. In short, there is no\n\nshowing that a competency hearing would have led to a contrary finding. Counsel was\n\nnot deficient in failing to seek a further competency hearing, nor has any prejudice\n\nbeen demonstrated. Felde v. Butler, 817 F.2d at 283.\n\n\n\n                   H. Failure to Follow Advisory Ethics Opinion\n\n\n\n       Petitioner argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to follow the\n\nsuggestions of an Advisory Ethics Opinion.\n\n       Being concerned about the petitioner\u2019s request that they not present any\n\nmitigating proof or argue for a life sentence at the sentencing hearing, trial counsel\n\nsecured an advisory opinion. Advisory Ethics Opinion 84-A-255 stated that although\n\ncounsel\u2019s beliefs and duties must yield to the beliefs and rights of the client, counsel\n\nwas not required to advocate the legal choices on behalf of the client. Yet, the opinion\n\nstated \u201c[c]ounsel is ethically obligated to follow the law and to do nothing in opposition\n\nto the client\u2019s moral and legal choices.\u201d The opinion concluded:\n\n       Counsel should fully inform the accused of his legal rights to conduct a\n       defense of his choice as guaranteed by the Constitution. The accused\n       should be fully advised by counsel that his rights and interests are in\n       conflict with counsel\u2019s moral beliefs and ethical responsibilities. In [the]\n       event the accused maintains his instance [sic] on no actions or\n       arguments on his behalf against the death penalty being imposed, then\n       counsel should advise the accused that a motion to withdraw from those\n       portions of the trial will be filed with the court. The consequences of this\n       action should be fully explained to the accused. The court should be\n       fully informed of the conflicts between counsel and the accused.\n       Counsel should seek an adjudication that the accused is competent to\n       represent himself during the voir dire examination of prospective jurors\n       and the penalty stages of the trial or any other portion of the trial where\n       the conflict is imminent. Counsel should move the court to withdraw\n       form [sic] representation during the portion of the trial where the conflict\n       is manifested.\n\n       Trial counsel believed that petitioner was aware of the seriousness of the\n\n                                           24\n\fproceedings and appreciated the ramifications of his decision. The evidence supports\n\nthe trial court\u2019s findings that petitioner was competent to stand trial, aid in his defense\n\nand to have input into the decision making process. There is nothing in the record to\n\nsuggest otherwise.\n\n         Counsel chose not to move the court for permission to withdraw during the\n\npenalty phase. They felt obligated to represent petitioner rather than abandoning him.\n\nAlthough petitioner did not want counsel to do anything, they were able to convince\n\nhim to allow them to make an argument on his behalf. Neither the state nor the\n\npetitioner put on any proof at the sentencing hearing.\n\n         We do not find that the failure of counsel to move to withdraw from\n\nrepresentation was ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner had agreed to allow\n\ncounsel to make a closing argument. Counsel followed the lawful directives of a\n\ncompetent client.     A request to withdraw would have been to the detriment of\n\npetitioner. Counsel acted within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in\n\ncriminal practice. Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930 (Tenn. 1975). This issue is without\n\nmerit.\n\n\n\n\n                                    I. Final Argument\n\n\n\n         Petitioner argues that trial counsel should have argued to the jury the victims\u2019\n\ncriminal activity of selling drugs, the petitioner\u2019s youth, and petitioner\u2019s lack of a violent\n\ncriminal history. The post-conviction court found that counsel was not ineffective for\n\nfailing to argue these mitigating circumstances. Specifically, the post-conviction court\n\nfound that the jury already knew that the case revolved around a drug deal and that\n\nthe petitioner\u2019s age (27 or 28 years old) would have been unlikely to have any effect\n\nupon the jury. The court further found that if counsel had opened the door with the\n\npetitioner\u2019s nonviolent criminal history, the state would have countered with a\n\ndamaging videotape of the petitioner during an interview with the media in Ohio. In\n\nthat videotape the petitioner apparently indicated he did not care about the family of\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fthe special deputy he shot at the time of his capture. Since the evidence does not\n\npreponderate against the findings of the trial court, petitioner has not shown that the\n\nresults of the proceedings would have been any different if counsel had argued these\n\nfactors. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.\n\n       The trial court denied trial counsel\u2019s request that it instruct the jury that they\n\ncould consider as mitigating circumstances the victims\u2019 participation in a drug\n\ntransaction, the petitioner\u2019s lack of a prior record of violent criminal activity, and the\n\npetitioner\u2019s youth. At the same time, the trial court ruled:\n\n\n       I\u2019m going to give the defense great leeway as to whether or not they\n       would go far afield. You would feel free to object. It would not be\n       discourteous, and I\u2019d rule on it at that time, but I do not want to limit them\n       in their argument in a case like this.\n\n\n       Trial counsel believed that because the trial court was not going to charge the\n\njury on the mitigating factors, trial counsel could not argue them to the jury. Therefore,\n\ntrial counsel\u2019s final argument was basically a plea for mercy. Under the circumstances\n\nthe plea for mercy did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. See Darden v.\n\nWainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986).\n\n\n\n\n                         DENIAL OF FUNDS FOR EXPERTS\n\n\n\n                            A. Contentions of the Parties\n\n\n\n       The petitioner contends that the trial court denied him effective assistance of\n\ncounsel by denying his motion requesting funds for a private investigator and a\n\nballistics expert. The petitioner further contends that counsel was ineffective by failing\n\nto request a pathologist, criminologist, medical experts and/or a forensic expert. It is\n\nthe petitioner\u2019s contention that experts and investigators would have insured that an\n\nadequate record was developed on the issues presented to, and decided by, the jury.\n\n       The state responds that complaints about the trial court\u2019s denial of expert funds\n\nshould have been raised in an interlocutory appeal or on direct appeal, and thus, the\n\n                                            26\n\fissue is waived. Regardless, the state argues that the petitioner has failed to show\n\nhow he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s rulings. As to counsel\u2019s failure to request\n\nadditional experts, the state submits that counsel requested the appropriate expert\n\nservices and would not have prevailed in further requests. Moreover, the state submits\n\nthat the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that this failure resulted in any prejudice.\n\n\n\n                            B. Need for Expert Services\n\n\n\n       The decision of whether to authorize investigative or expert services lies within\n\nthe sound discretion of the trial court. See State v. Cazes, 875 S.W.2d 253, 261\n\n(Tenn.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1086, 115 S. Ct. 743, 130 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1995);\n\nState v. O\u2019Guinn, 709 S.W.2d 561, 568 (Tenn.) cert. denied, 479 U.S. 871, 107 S. Ct.\n\n244, 93 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1986). The right to these services exists only upon a showing\n\nof a particularized need. State v. Shepherd, 902 S.W.2d 895, 904 (Tenn.1995); State\n\nv. Black, 815 S.W.2d 166, 179-80 (Tenn.1991). \"The defendant must show that a\n\nsubstantial need exists requiring the assistance of state paid supporting services and\n\nthat his defense cannot be fully developed without such professional assistance.\" State\n\n\n\nv. Evans, 838 S.W.2d 185, 192 (Tenn.1992), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1064, 114 S. Ct.\n\n740, 126 L. Ed. 2d 702 (1994).\n\n\n\n                                       C. Facts\n\n\n\n       In the present case, trial counsel requested funds to hire a psychiatrist, a\n\nballistics expert, and a private investigator.    The trial court granted funds for a\n\npsychiatrist but denied the other requests. The ballistics expert was requested\n\nbecause the defense wanted to show that the location of the spent cartridges was\n\ninconsistent with the victims being killed in Robertson County. After the request for a\n\nballistics expert was denied, trial counsel went to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and asked\n\nColonel John Oliver to run tests as to the trajectory of the spent shells. Col. Oliver did\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\fso and testified at trial that the weapon would not have ejected the shells in the pattern\n\ndemonstrated by the state\u2019s proof.\n\n       When the trial court denied their motion for an investigator, trial counsel did their\n\nown investigation based on the discovery provided by the state. This included\n\ninformation provided by Sheriff Emery, who traveled to several states gathering\n\ninformation. Moreover, at the post-conviction hearing, counsel testified that while it\n\nwas a hardship, they did travel to the tri-state area where the petitioner had been\n\ncaptured. They also traveled to Hickman County and interviewed witnesses in\n\nfurtherance of their investigation.\n\n\n\n                                D. Waiver and Prejudice\n\n\n\n       We first note that the issue relating to the private investigator and ballistics\n\nexpert was not raised on direct appeal. Accordingly, this issue is waived pursuant to\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-112(b)(1); see also House v. State, 911 S.W.2d 705 (Tenn.\n\n1995), cert. denied,     U.S.     , 116 S. Ct. 1685, 134 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1996).\n\n       Furthermore, petitioner has demonstrated no prejudice as a result of the denial\n\nof funds for the various expert witnesses. No experts testified at the post-conviction\n\nhearing. Without such evidence we are left to speculate as to whether such expert\n\nproof would have been beneficial to petitioner. Davis v. State, 912 S.W.2d 689, 698\n\n(Tenn. 1995). Specifically, there is no showing as to what the testimony of a ballistics\n\nexpert, pathologist, criminologist, medical expert and/or forensic expert would be.\n\nThere is also no showing as to what significant information a private investigator would\n\nhave discovered that was not known by defense counsel as a result of their own\n\ninvestigation.\n\n       This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                    WITHHOLDING EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE\n\n\n\n                            A. Contentions of the Parties\n\n\n                                            28\n\f       The petitioner contends that the state failed to provide potentially exculpatory\n\nevidence to the defense in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194,\n\n10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). The petitioner contends that trial counsel was hampered by\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s failure to hand over certain reports with the names of other persons\n\nwho might have knowledge of the murders.\n\n       The state argues that the post-conviction court properly held that the petitioner\n\nfailed to demonstrate that this evidence would have created a reasonable probability\n\nof a different result at his trial. The state further submits that since one of the\n\ndocuments was not given to the prosecuting office until eight years after the trial, the\n\npost-conviction court properly held that the document was not known to the\n\nprosecution at the time of trial.\n\n\n\n                                    B. Brady v. Maryland\n\n\n\n       In Brady v. Maryland, the United States Supreme Court held that any\n\n\"suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request\n\nviolates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\n\nirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct.\n\nat 1196-97. The duty to disclose extends to all \"favorable information\" regardless of\n\nwhether the evidence is admissible at trial. State v. Marshall, 845 S.W.2d 228, 232-33\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1992); Branch v. State, 4 Tenn. Crim. App. 164, 168, 469 S.W.2d\n\n533, 536 (1969). In United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 3380,\n\n87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985), the Supreme Court held that both exculpatory and\n\nimpeachment evidence fall under the Brady rule.\n\n       Before an accused is entitled to relief under this theory, he must establish\n\nseveral prerequisites: (a) the prosecution must have suppressed the evidence; (b) the\n\nevidence suppressed must have been favorable to the accused; and (c) the evidence\n\nmust have been material. See United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 674-75, 105 S. Ct.\n\nat 3379-80; Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S. Ct. at 1196-97; State v. Edgin,\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f902 S.W.2d 387, 390 (Tenn. 1995). Evidence is considered material only if there is\n\na reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\n\nresults of the proceeding would have been different. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419,\n\n115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995); State v. Edgin, 902 S.W.2d at 390.\n\n\n\n                               C. The Exculpatory Documents\n\n\n\n       At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner presented two documents that\n\nwere not provided to defense counsel before trial.          The first document is an\n\ninvestigative report prepared by Jeff Long, an investigator for the District Attorney\u2019s\n\noffice in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit. The report contains names of various\n\nindividuals with possible knowledge of the murders in this case, and those names were\n\nnot provided to the petitioner\u2019s counsel. According to the cover letter dated September\n\n1, 1983, this investigative report was sent to District Attorney General Lawrence Ray\n\nWhitley of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, the prosecutor in this case.\n\n       The second document is a letter dated September 29, 1983, to Investigator Jeff\n\nLong in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit from an assistant district attorney in the\n\nTwenty-first Judicial Circuit. The letter stated that the father of a local resident had\n\nbeen contacted by individuals in Texas and was \u201coffered the job of killing someone, for\n\na substantial sum of money.\u201d The local resident indicated that her father turned the\n\njob down; however, she felt certain that it was \u201cthe Jimmy Porter - Dale Dotson\n\ncircumstance.\u201d This letter was retained in the files in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit\n\nand not given to the prosecuting District Attorney\u2019s office in the Ninth Judicial Circuit\n\nuntil years after the trial.\n\n       In denying relief, the post-conviction court found that these materials would not\n\nhave altered the outcome of the case.\n\n\n\n                                        D. Ruling\n\n\n\n       Certainly, it is regrettable that defense counsel was unaware of these\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fdocuments. As stated in petitioner\u2019s brief, these documents \u201ccontained names as well\n\nas other information which would have been useful to Zagorski\u2019s trial counsel in\n\ninvestigating the murders.\u201d However, the crucial issue is whether these documents are\n\n\u201cfavorable\u201d and \u201cmaterial.\u201d United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 674-75, 105 S.Ct. at\n\n3379-80. There was no testimony at the post-conviction hearing that these documents\n\nled or would have led to \u201cfavorable\u201d information. See Foster v. State,        S.W.2d\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1996). Furthermore, in order for petitioner to get relief there must\n\nbe a reasonable probability that, had this evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different. State v. Edgin, 902 S.W.2d at 390.\n\nThe evidence does not preponderate against the trial court\u2019s finding that this material\n\nwould not have affected the outcome of the trial. In short, there is no showing that the\n\nfailure to disclose this information \u201cundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d\n\nKyles, 514 U.S. at     , 115 S.Ct. at 1566; Edgin, 902 S.W.2d at 390.\n\n       The burden is on the petitioner to prove a constitutional violation by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Edgin, 902 S.W.2d at 389; State v. Spurlock, 874\n\nS.W.2d 602, 610 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993). This he has failed to do.\n\n       This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n       We find no reversible error; therefore, the judgment of the trial court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                                  JOE G.
