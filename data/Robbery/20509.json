California, 386 U.S. 738, 87\r\nS. Ct. 1396 (1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of the record and\r\ndemonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to be advanced.\u00a0 See High v.\r\nState, 573 S.W.2d 807, 811-12 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978).\r\n\r\nA copy\r\nof counsel=s brief was delivered to appellant.\u00a0 Appellant was advised of the right\r\nto examine the appellate record and file a pro se response.\u00a0 See Stafford v.\r\nState, 813 S.W.2d 503, 510 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\u00a0\u00a0 On June 4, 2009,\r\nappellant filed a pro se response to counsel=s brief.\r\n\r\nWe have\r\ncarefully reviewed the record, counsel=s brief, and appellant=s response, and agree the appeal is\r\nwholly frivolous and without merit.\u00a0 Further, we find no reversible error in\r\nthe record.\u00a0 A discussion of the brief would add nothing to the jurisprudence\r\nof the state.\u00a0 We are not to address the merits of each claim raised in an Anders\r\nbrief or a pro se response when we have determined there are no arguable\r\ngrounds for review.\u00a0 See Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 827-28 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 2005).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAccordingly,\r\nthe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPanel consists of Justices Seymore, Brown, and\r\nSullivan.\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish C Tex.
