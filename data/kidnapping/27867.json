Max O. Cogburn, Jr., District Judge. (1:19-cr-00063-MOC-WCM-1)\n\n\nSubmitted: May 13, 2021                                            Decided: June 4, 2021\n\n\nBefore NIEMEYER, KEENAN, and HARRIS, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nAffirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\n\n\nAndrew B. Banzhoff, DEVEREUX BANZHOFF, PLLC, Asheville, North Carolina, for\nAppellant. R. Andrew Murray, United States Attorney, Anthony J. Enright, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Charlotte,\nNorth Carolina, for Appellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n       A jury convicted Joseph Cecil Vandevere of transmitting a threatening\n\ncommunication in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c). On appeal,\n\nVandevere maintains that the communication contained constitutionally protected speech\n\nand not an unprotected \u201ctrue threat,\u201d and that the district court thus erred in denying his\n\nmotions to dismiss the indictment and for a judgment of acquittal. Finding no reversible\n\nerror, we affirm.\n\n       We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 motion for a\n\njudgment of acquittal, United States v. Tillmon, 954 F.3d 628, 637 (4th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n140 S. Ct. 91 (2019), and whether a written communication is constitutionally protected\n\nspeech or \u201can unprotected \u2018true threat,\u2019\u201d United States v. Bly, 510 F.3d 453, 457 (4th Cir.\n\n2007). The transmission of threats in interstate commerce is prohibited by 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 875(c). To convict a defendant of violating \u00a7 875(c), the government must establish\n\n\u201c(1) that the defendant knowingly transmitted a communication in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce; (2) that the defendant subjectively intended the communication as a threat; and\n\n(3) that the content of the communication contained a \u2018true threat\u2019 to kidnap or injure.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. White, 810 F.3d 212, 220-21 (4th Cir. 2016). \u201cTo prove the second\n\nelement, the [g]overnment . . . must establish that the defendant transmitted the\n\ncommunication for the purpose of issuing a threat, or with knowledge that the\n\ncommunication will be viewed as a threat, or, perhaps, with reckless disregard for the\n\nlikelihood that the communication will be viewed as a threat.\u201d Id. at 221 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n                                             2\n\f       \u201c[A] true threat in the constitutional sense is one that a reasonable recipient who is\n\nfamiliar with the circumstances would interpret as a serious expression of an intent to do\n\nharm.\u201d Id. at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe speaker need not actually intend\n\nto carry out the threat,\u201d because \u201ca prohibition on true threats protects individuals from the\n\nfear of violence and from the disruption that fear engenders, in addition to protecting people\n\nfrom the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.\u201d Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S.\n\n343, 359-60 (2003) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In analyzing the parameters of the First Amendment\u2019s protection of threatening\n\nlanguage in Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705 (1969), the Supreme Court identified four\n\nfactors in determining that the statement at issue in that case was not a true threat. The\n\nCourt noted that Watts\u2019 communication was: (1) made in jest; (2) to a public audience;\n\n(3) in political opposition to the President; and (4) conditioned upon an event the speaker\n\nhimself vowed would never occur. Id. at 707-08; see also United States v. Lockhart, 382\n\nF.3d 447, 451-52 (4th Cir. 2004) (applying these four factors and finding that statement\n\ncontained a true threat).\n\n       In applying these four factors to Vandevere\u2019s case, we conclude that his statement,\n\ndirected to a private party on Twitter, contained a true threat. We note first that a\n\nreasonable recipient familiar with the context would have felt threatened by the message\n\nand would not have construed it as a joke. Second, unlike the statement made to the public\n\nin Watts, the tweet here was specifically directed at one person, albeit in a public forum.\n\nThird, the tweet was not communicated in a manner to engage anyone in public discourse\n\nregarding his political beliefs. Finally, viewing the tweet in the context in which it was\n\n                                              3\n\freceived, Vandevere\u2019s statement would indicate to a reasonable recipient that Vandevere\n\nhad a serious intent to do harm.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral\n\nargument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials\n\nbefore this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                             AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f",
