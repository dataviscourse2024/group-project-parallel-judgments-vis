In addition, because the defendant committed acts constituting kidnapping in the second degree during. the course of the same criminal transaction, a count charging him with that crime was properly included in the indictment (see, CPL 200.20 [6]), notwithstanding that, because of his age, the defendant was not criminally responsible for that conduct (see, Penal Law \u00a7 30.00 [1]). Although the County Court was empowered to accept a plea of guilty to those counts of the indictment for which the defendant was criminally responsible (see, CPL 220.10 [4], [5] [g]), it was not authorized to accept a plea of guilty to kidnapping in the second degree (see, CPL 220.10 [4], [5] [g]; cf., People v Bartley, 47 NY2d 965; People v Hicks, 79 AD2d 887). The challenged portion of the defendant\u2019s plea, which the People do not claim is an integral part of a nonseverable plea bargain (cf., People v Bartley, supra), must accordingly be set aside and deemed a nullity (cf, CPL 310.85 [2]). However, there is no basis for disturbing the sentences imposed for assault in the first degree, for which the defendant was criminally responsible (see, People v Kazepis, 101 AD2d 816; People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80). Bracken, J. P., Kooper, Harwood and Balletta, JJ., concur.\n",
