            "opinion_text": "\n*1199OPINION\nBy the Court,\nShearing, J. :\nThis is an appeal from a district court order terminating the parental rights of appellant Michael Greeson (\u201cGreeson\u201d). Greeson and respondent Toni Lynn Barnes (\u201cBarnes\u201d) were divorced on March 19, 1987. At the time of their divorce, their son, Kevin, was just over one year old. The divorce decree granted Barnes primary physical custody of Kevin and granted Greeson visitation one week per month. The decree also ordered Greeson to pay $200 per month in child support.\n*1200For the six months following the divorce, Greeson paid $200 per month in child support and exercised his visitation rights five of the six weeks. In September 1987, a review hearing was held and Greeson failed to attend.1 The district court reduced Greeson\u2019s visitation rights to alternating weekends within the Reno city limits based on Kevin\u2019s young age and Barnes\u2019s uncon-troverted testimony that the trips to California, where Greeson resided, were too difficult for the child.\nThe parties disputed the frequency with which Greeson exercised his visitation rights for the six or seven months following the September 1987 review hearing. Both parties agreed, however, that between 1988 and the October 1992 trial date, Greeson visited Kevin on only one occasion. According to Barnes, Greeson\u2019s contact with Kevin was minimal during that time, with the last contact via telephone in April 1991. For approximately three years prior to the 1992 trial, Greeson called Barnes once or twice each year and, during those phone calls, never requested to speak with Kevin. Moreover, between the 1987 hearing and the 1992 trial, Greeson sent only $60 in child support and only made those payments after he discovered that Barnes had petitioned for termination of his parental rights.\nBecause of the sanctity of parental rights, a standard of proof of at least clear and convincing evidence is required before a court can terminate parental rights. NRS 128.090(2); Champagne v. Welfare Division, 100 Nev. 640, 648, 691 P.2d 849, 854 (1984).\nNRS 128.105 sets forth the grounds for termination of parental rights.2 In Champagne, this court designated the considerations *1201relating to the conduct of the parent as the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d ground, and the considerations relating to the child\u2019s best interest as the \u201cdispositional\u201d ground. In 1989, in reaction to our decision in Champagne which seemed to accord primary emphasis to the rights of the parent over the rights of the child, the legislature added the following language to NRS 128.105: \u201cwith the initial and primary consideration being whether the best interests of the child would be served by the termination . . . .\u201d Hearings on S.B. 99 Before the Senate Committee on Judiciary, February 18, 1987, pp. 224-25, 235-36; February 19, 1987, p. 267; February 24, 1987, pp. 319-22; April 16, 1987, p. 1616. This amendment did not alter the requirement set out in NRS 128.105 and Champagne that at least one of the grounds alleging parental fault must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution mandates this requirement. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 769-70 (1982).\nUnder NRS 128.105, a lower court may terminate a parent\u2019s rights if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has abandoned the child and that terminating the parent\u2019s rights is in the best interest of the child. On appeal, this court will uphold an order terminating parental rights if substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that both of these grounds have been established by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Kobinski v. State, 103 Nev. 293, 296, 738 P.2d 895, 897 (1987).\nThe district court determined that Greeson had abandoned his son Kevin pursuant to NRS 128.105(1). \u201cAbandonment\u201d is defined in NRS 128.012(1) as \u201cany conduct . . . which evinces a settled purpose ... to forego all parental custody and relinquish all claims to the child.\u201d Under NRS 128.012(2), a parent is presumed to have intended to abandon the child if that parent leaves the child in the care and custody of another without provision for the child\u2019s support and without communication for a period of six months.\nIn the instant case, Greeson failed to provide for Kevin\u2019s *1202support for approximately five years,3 visited Kevin only once during that period and had only minimal additional contact with the child during this time. This conduct established the presumption that Greeson intended to abandon Kevin, and the trial court found that Greeson failed to rebut this presumption.\nGreeson\u2019s failure to pay child support and failure to exercise visitation rights was undisputed. Greeson merely claimed (1) that he could not locate his son, and (2) that Barnes frustrated his attempts at visits. However, the district court found that Greeson\u2019s claim that he could not locate his son was belied by the fact that Greeson\u2019s own parents maintained visitation with their grandson throughout the five-year period.\nWhile the district court found that Barnes frustrated Greeson\u2019s efforts to visit with Kevin from September 1987 to January 1989, it further found that her failure to encourage contact at that time was not unreasonable where Greeson continually threatened her life and the lives of members of her family, and threatened to abduct Kevin during this period. Greeson argued that his efforts toward visitation were also frustrated after 1989, but the trial court made no such finding. The weight and credibility of a witness\u2019s testimony is within the sole province of the trier of fact. Washington v. State, 96 Nev. 305, 308, 608 P.2d 1101, 1103 (1980). The trial court also found that Greeson made no effort to enforce his visitation rights. Greeson testified during the trial that he could not afford an attorney; however, he later admitted that his father offered him financial assistance to hire an attorney and that he refused. It is no wonder that the trial court did not choose to believe Greeson\u2019s testimony that he did not abandon his son!\nAlthough Champagne v. Welfare Division, 100 Nev. 640, 691 P.2d 849 (1984), established a new standard as to certain aspects of parental rights, it did not change the factors to be considered on the issue of abandonment. Since the Champagne decision, this court has continued to rely upon the reasoning and conclusions of termination cases decided prior to Champagne when considering *1203abandonment. After the Champagne decision, in Drury v. Lang, 105 Nev. 430, 433, 776 P.2d 843, 845 (1989), this court cited with approval four pre-Champagne cases on the issue of abandonment: Pyborn v. Quathamer, 96 Nev. 145, 605 P.2d 1147 (1980); Sernaker v. Ehrlich, 86 Nev. 277, 468 P.2d 5 (1970); Casper v. Huber, 85 Nev. 474, 456 P.2d 436 (1969); and Carson v. Lowe, 76 Nev. 446, 357 P.2d 591 (1960).4\nThe case at bar presents a picture of abandonment at least as compelling as those presented in Pyborn, Sernaker, Casper, and Carson. Greeson had only negligible contact with Kevin for a period of five years and paid only $60 in child support during that time. In the cases cited above, the fathers\u2019 conduct was comparatively less egregious and this court decided that parental rights were properly terminated. In Pyborn, there were ten months of negligible communication and support. In both Sernaker and *1204Carson, the fathers lived much farther away from the child than in the case at bar. In Sernaker, the father resided in Pennsylvania while the child resided in Nevada. In Carson, the father resided in Florida and the child in Nevada. Greeson, however, lives in northern California, comparatively close to Kevin.\nIn Sernaker, the father\u2019s contact with the child was more substantial than in the instant case; he made payments and exercised visitation rights for approximately three years. Greeson paid child support and exercised visitation for only six months. Where the father in Carson sent Christmas and birthday gifts, in the case at bar, the only evidence regarding gifts was the Christmas gift Greeson gave Kevin during the sole visit between 1988 and 1992. This court and other courts have recognized that a noncustodial parent demonstrates an intent not to abandon a child by providing financial support and/or by maintaining contact with the child. Greeson did neither.\nIn any contested termination of parental rights proceeding involving abandonment, the mere fact that the parent contests the termination may indicate that the parent does not have a \u201csettled purpose ... to forego all parental custody and relinquish all claims to the child.\u201d NRS 128.012(1). However, the trial court is not obligated to accord greater weight to the parent\u2019s belated protestations than to the parent\u2019s failure to provide support and communicate with the child over several years. On the contrary, there is no better illustration of the adage \u201cactions speak louder than words.\u201d When a parent fails to pay child support for five years and makes virtually no gesture demonstrative of real care and concern for the child, subsequent pleas of a lack of intent to abandon the child ring hollow. We hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that abandonment was established by clear and convincing evidence is supported by substantial evidence.\nThe test for determining the best interest of the child is, \u201c[i]f under no reasonable circumstances the child\u2019s best interest can be served by sustaining the parental tie, dispositional grounds for termination exist.\u201d Champagne v. Welfare Division, 100 Nev. 640, 652, 691 P.2d 849, 858 (1984). In determining whether termination was in Kevin\u2019s best interest, the district court emphasized that Barnes and her present husband, Mr. Barnes, furnished Kevin with a stable environment and consistently provided him with love, attention, discipline, and emotional support. The district court also noted Greeson\u2019s express and implied threats of death and serious bodily injury to Barnes, her father, and her husband, and his threats to abduct Kevin, and was unfavorably *1205impressed with Greeson\u2019s willingness to make Kevin \u201ca secondary victim of such hostility.\u201d Moreover, Kevin did not wish to speak with Greeson when visitation was attempted under the supervision of the court-appointed child advocate, and Kevin was, in fact, afraid of Greeson. To suggest, as Greeson does, that a seven-year-old\u2019s negative attitude toward a father who has failed to visit with him in five years must necessarily have been induced by the mother is unrealistic and demeans the child.\nKevin is currently eight years old and during the past approximately six years, has only visited with Greeson once. Barnes and her husband have been married for three years and Kevin has resided with them for almost half of his life. As the district court noted, Kevin looks to Mr. Barnes as his father figure. We hold that clear and convincing evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that termination of Greeson\u2019s parental rights is in Kevin\u2019s best interest.\nThe district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are in accord with the statutes and case law of this state, including the Champagne decision. This court has no basis for contesting the findings of the district court which had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and judge their credibility. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.\nSteffen, C. J., and Young and Rose, JJ., concur.\n\nDuring the trial, Greeson alleged that he called the district court three days before the scheduled review hearing in order to reschedule the hearing. He testified that he attempted to reschedule because his current wife, who was then four months pregnant, told him that she was experiencing problems with her pregnancy. Greeson farther testified that he did not know whether the review hearing was rescheduled and that if it had been rescheduled, he did not receive notice of the new hearing date. In fiis brief on appeal Greeson states that he \u201cassumed that the review hearing had been continued where in actuality it had not.\u201d\nThere is nothing in the record indicating that Greeson ever contacted the district court and we do not know whether the district court found Greeson\u2019s explanation for his failure to appear at the review hearing credible.\nGreeson further alleges on appeal that he did not receive a copy of the district court orders changing visitation at the review hearing. However, he admits that Barnes informed him of the new visitation schedule.\n\n\nNRS 128.105 states in pertinent part:\nAn order of the court for termination of parental rights must be made *1201in light of the considerations set forth in this section and NRS 128.106, 128.107 and 128.108, with the initial and primary consideration being whether the best interests of the child would be served by the termination, but requiring a finding that the conduct of the parent or parents demonstrated at least one of the following:\n1. Abandonment of the child;\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\nGreeson offered two theories for his failure to pay child support. On the one hand, he claimed that he could no longer afford the court-ordered $200 per month child support payment as he was disabled from a job-related injury and on welfare. However, Greeson also testified during the trial that he did not make payments because Barnes did not allow him to see Kevin. He testified, \u201c[([here was nothing to pay, because she wasn\u2019t letting me see him.\u201d\nHad Greeson only asserted the former theory, he still would have been unable to rebut the presumption of abandonment since he testified that a paralegal in California told him that he could go to court to modify the divorce decree to reduce the child support payments to an amount within his means. Greeson offered no explanation, for his failure to do so.\n\n\nIn Pyborn v. Quathamer, 96 Nev. 145, 605 P.2d 1147 (1980), this court held that a father who made no real attempts to communicate with his child for a period of approximately ten months and failed or made only token efforts to pay support for the child had abandoned the child. The father in Pyborn claimed that the mother frustrated his attempts to communicate with his child. Pyborn, 96 Nev. at 147, 605 P.2d at 1148. This court deferred to the district court\u2019s finding to the contrary. Id. Moreover, this court emphasized the fact that the father made no attempts to initiate any legal proceedings to impose his visitation rights. Id.\nIn Sernaker v. Ehrlich, 86 Nev. 277, 468 P.2d 5 (1970), this court upheld the termination of a father\u2019s parental rights on the ground of abandonment. Following a divorce in 1962, the father in Sernaker made child support payments inconsistently and observed visitation every weekend until approximately 1965, when payments and communication with the child became nominal. Id. at 278-79, 468 P.2d at 6. At the time of the termination hearing, the father owed approximately $11,000 in arrearages for wife and child support. Id. at 279, 468 P.2d at 6. This court stated that while nonsupport is not synonymous with abandonment, it is a factor in determining whether a parent has abandoned his child. Id. at 280, 468 P.2d at 7. We held that \u201c[l]ack of support plus other conduct such as a failure to communicate by letter or telephone, or absence of sending of gifts is sufficient to uphold the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the child had been abandoned.\u201d Id. As in Pyborn, both the district court and this court were unpersuaded by the father\u2019s argument that the mother withheld visitation, particularly where the father did not initiate any legal proceedings to enforce his visitation rights.\nIn Carson v. Lowe, 76 Nev. 446, 357 P.2d 591 (1960), this court upheld the district court\u2019s finding that the father had abandoned his child. We noted that from 1956 to 1959 the father failed to support the child and that communication or attempts at communication with the child during that time were meager. Id. at 449, 357 P.2d at 593. The father\u2019s gifts to the child were limited to the child\u2019s birthday and Christmas. Id. Though the father sought to prove that the mother frustrated his attempts to communicate with his infant son, this court was unpersuaded as he \u201cmade no real attempt to insist upon or to enforce his rights of visitation under the divorce decree.\u201d Id. at 449, 357 P.2d at 593.\n\n",

If the \u201ccapital punishment of welfare law\u201d must be invoked, it should be done only under the strictest of conditions as set forth in this opinion.\n\nChampagne v. Welfare Division\n\n100 Nev. 640, 664, 691 P. 2d 849, 865 (1984)\n\nI dissent from the judgment terminating this father\u2019s parental rights because it is unfair to the father and contrary to the best interests of Kevin that this father and son should have to suffer the \u201ccapital punishment of welfare law\u201d merely because the father-son relationship was temporarily disrupted by an ongoing dispute involving Kevin\u2019s father and mother and Kevin\u2019s present stepfather.\nThere are neither jurisdictional nor dispositional grounds for termination of parental rights in this case. Greeson most certainly did not \u201cabandon\u201d his son; and it cannot possibly be said under any version of the facts of this case that \u201cunder no reasonable circumstances [can] the child\u2019s best interest ... be served by sustaining the parental tie.\u201d Champagne, 100 Nev. at 652, 691 P.2d at 858.\n\n*1206\nJURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS\n\nFor the trial court to have concluded that Greeson abandoned his son it must have found that this father\u2019s conduct \u201cevince[d] a settled purpose ... to forego all parental custody and relinquish all claims to the child.\u201d NRS 128.012(1). There is not the slightest bit of evidence in this case that the father intended to give up his custody rights, much less to \u201crelinquish all claims to the child.\u201d If this father had any \u201csettled purpose\u201d at all in these proceedings, it was to try to maintain his father-child relationship under the most trying of circumstances.1\n*1207This is not an abandonment case.2 This is a case in which an absent father failed for a period of time to pay child support for a child that was being turned away from him by the child\u2019s mother and stepfather and the mother\u2019s family. For some period of time, at least, Greeson was not permitted to see his son. Ms. Barnes\u2019 father testified that when Greeson attempted to visit Kevin, he \u201ca time or two, run him oif. . . because I didn\u2019t like his attitude.\u201d In a situation like this one, where the father was \u201crun off\u201d from his visitation attempts, it is very difficult indeed for me to understand how the trial court could possibly have decreed that this father is to be lost forever from this son. There is no evidence of abandonment in this case, and I believe the error of the trial court in this matter to be violative of the constitutional limits on parental severance set forth in Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982).\nWhen I say that parental rights should not be terminated for failure to make timely child support payments, I am in no way condoning the unfortunately common practice of noncustodial parents\u2019 refusing to pay child support payments because of real or perceived grievances relating to violation of their visitation rights or to claimed alienation of the child by the custodial parent. Violation of support decrees regularly calls for severe penalties, even jail sentences; still, if every time this kind of problem arises, we are going to permit the termination of the non-paying natural parent\u2019s legal rights as a mother or father, we \u00e1re going to be wreaking a terrible disruption of the already disrupted family life in this country.3\n*1208It can be argued that Michael Greeson might have handled these problems with his former wife in a better way, but his becoming involved in these kinds of rather typical conflicts does not mean that he deserves to have his child taken away from him forever. He is the natural father; he has had a terrible fight with the child\u2019s mother and her new husband; but this does not mean that he has to be deprived of his status as the father of his child, such drastic action is neither in the child\u2019s interest nor the father\u2019s. Termination is in no one\u2019s best interest. The child does not deserve to have his natural father taken away from him. The child loses his rights of inheritance and his rights to the company of his father, all because of a petty and spiteful disagreement between his mother and father and because this eight-year-old child has been taught that his father is \u201cstupid.\u201d4\nAs I have said, this is not an abandonment case, whatever else it might be. This father did not abandon his son and does not deserve the \u201ccapital punishment\u201d that was imposed upon him in this case. There are no jurisdictional grounds to support this termination of parental rights decree.\n\nDISPOSITIONAL GROUNDS\n\nEven if there were some evidence of abandonment in this case, even if this father had been clearly and convincingly proven to have had a settled purpose to get rid of Kevin, to \u201cforego all parental custody\u201d and voluntarily \u201crelinquish all claims to the child,\u201d certainly, under Champagne, there are any number of \u201creasonable circumstances\u201d under which Kevin\u2019s interests would \u201cbe served by sustaining the parental tie.\u201d5 There are insufficient dispositional grounds to justify this severance of parental rights.\n*1209The kinds of parental rights termination cases that we ordinarily see are cases in which it is quite apparent that the child\u2019s interests cannot be served by sustaining the parental tie with parents who, for example, are in prison, are hopeless drug addicts or who have actually demonstrated a \u201csettled purpose\u201d to give up their parental rights. This is not such a case. There is nothing wrong with this father; he is not morally unsuited to be a father; he is not a bad pers'on; he is not an unfit parent. Granted, he may have done wrong in the turmoil after his divorce when he lost contact with his son and failed to make court-ordered child support payments on time. This does not provide cause for permanently taking his son away from him and never letting him see Kevin again. (Even if, for now, Kevin thinks his father is \u201cstupid.\u201d) Every noncustodial parent who is delinquent in child-support payments will now, it seems to me, be subject to retaliatory attempts to terminate their parental rights. Termination of parental rights is designed for cases in which there is no way in which the child\u2019s interests can be reasonably served except by taking the offending parent out of the child\u2019s life. Termination of parental rights is not designed as a way to punish parents who get behind in their child-support payments.\nThe trial judge in this case could not possibly have fairly concluded that there were no \u201creasonable circumstances\u201d under which the father\u2019s parental rights could be sustained because the judge made no inquiry into such circumstances. The issue was not even litigated. There are no dispositional grounds for termination of parental rights in this case.\nIn 1982,6 the Supreme Court held in Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, that the interest of a natural parent was a \u201cfundamental liberty interest,\u201d guarded by the United States Constitution and that this \u201cinterest does not evaporate simply because [the natural parent] ha[s] not been [a] model parent[].\u201d Id. at 753. \u201c[T]he degree and duration of parental fault or incapacity necessary to establish grounds for termination is greater than that required for other forms of judicial intervention.\u201d Champagne, 100 Nev. at 648, 691 P.2d at 854-55. For this court to say blandly that it is clearly convinced that this father voluntarily had a \u201csettled purpose\u201d to \u201crelinquish\u201d his rights of fatherhood, and for this court *1210to say further that there are no reasonable alternatives to termination of parental rights is, in my opinion, a perversion of law and a perversion of nature. There are neither jurisdictional nor disposi-tional grounds here; so I would reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n\nThere are some minor conflicts in the evidence in this case, as discussed in the majority opinion, but there is certainly nothing that would even suggest that this father no longer wanted to be a father or that he wished to relinquish forever \u201call claims to the child.\u201d So that the reader of this dissent will have some appreciation of the tragedy that is inherent in the present judgment of this court I will review the facts in this case. When Kevin\u2019s mother and father got divorced in March of 1987, the father was ordered to pay $200.00 per month and was given the right to one week\u2019s visitation each month. The decree provided for a review of the matter at the end of six months. All went well initially; Greeson paid his child support and had the child with him for one week of each month with the exception of one visitation period. The problems in this case can clearly be traced to one event: the six-month court review of custody. Greeson tried to get the review hearing postponed because his new wife was about to deliver a baby. As so often happens in these kinds of situations, communications broke down between the court and the then lawyerless father. The postponement was given by the court, and the review hearing was rescheduled; but Greeson claims he did not get notice of the rescheduled hearing. The hearing went ahead in Greeson\u2019s absence. Greeson was later advised by the petitioner that at the hearing his visitation rights had been reduced from one week a month to every other weekend. Greeson never received a copy of the new custody order. Greeson exercised the new, diminished visitation rights on a regular basis until struck in the form of a huge verbal battle between Kevin\u2019s mother and Greeson\u2019s wife. The gist of the aftermath of this contretemps was that the mother would not let the father see his child for so long as he insisted on keeping his wife around. Greeson tried to avoid this restriction imposed on his visitation rights by arranging his now bi-monthly visitations with his son at the home of his parents, the child\u2019s grandparents; but the child\u2019s mother eventually told the paternal grandparents that she would not allow the child to visit with the grandparents if Greeson was going to be there.\nAfter the mentioned review hearing in which the new visitation orders were made, Greeson got behind in his child support payments. Greeson testified that this was due to a job-related injury which finally forced him to go onto welfare. He testified that, at the time, he was receiving under three hundred dollars a month. Greeson testified that he could not afford an attorney and did not know how to go about getting his support payments reduced and that he became very frustrated by the difficulties in visitation occasioned by his former wife and her husband and father. Ultimately, the mother refused to let Greeson see his son until he caught up with all of his child support payments.\nEven if we take the dimmest view of this father\u2019s conduct and the charged neglect (not \u201cabandonment\u201d) of his son during the post-divorce disruption of *1207his life, there is no evidence at all, much less \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that he abandoned his son, that he had formed a \u201csettled purpose\u201d or intention to forego all custody rights and voluntarily and purposefully \u201crelinquish all [parental] claims to his son.\u201d\n\n\nThere is some evidence in this case of Greeson\u2019s neglect of his son during this tumultuous period mentioned in footnote 1. There is not, however, such neglect as to justify termination of Greeson\u2019s parental rights. The pleading in this case avers that Kevin was \u201cneglected within the purview of NRS 128.012\u201d and charges that Greeson had \u201cfailed, neglected and refused to provide proper and necessary subsistence\u201d for the child. I stress, however, that this case proceeded on a theory of abandonment \u2014 intentional and purposeful \u201crelinquishment\u201d of parental rights by a parent.\nIt appears to me that the majority realizes that there was no evidence of abandonment and that to sustain the judgment of the trial court, it had to rely on the presumption contained in NRS 128.012, which relates to proof in welfare cases in which the abandoning parent makes no \u201cprovision for the child\u2019s support\u201d and where there is no \u201ccommunication for a period of six months.\u201d The statute has no application in a case such as this where provision for the child\u2019s support was made in the divorce decree and where the parents and child were certainly not incommunicado.\n\n\nNevada provides any number of remedies that an aggrieved parent and child can use to enforce child support obligations, including garnishment *1208proceedings, withholding of industrial insurance benefits or unemployment compensation, assignment of income, and even civil contempt proceedings. See, e.g., NRS Chapter 31A; NRS 31.295; NRS 616.550; NRS 612.457. These alternatives should have been explored before \u201ccapital punishment\u201d was imposed.\n\n\nTo me the most revealing evidence of the pattern of conduct of the mother and the stepfather comes to light in the testimony of the child advocate. The child told the child advocate that he did not want to see his father, \u201cbecause he was stupid.\u201d This tells me a lot about what was done to this child in the absence of his father. Young children would not ordinarily be expected to tell strangers that their fathers were \u201cstupid,\u201d absent some coaching or improper influence of some other adult. When asked whether he felt that the hostility of the mother and stepfather towards Mr. Greeson may have interfered with the contacts which Kevin had with his father, the child advocate answered, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d The child advocate also testified that. \u201c[b]oth Toni and Jack Barnes have been very hostile toward Mike [Greeson], My assumption is that Kevin would pick up on that.\u201d\n\n\nThe idea of permanent severance of the natural \u201cparental tie\u201d in this case is totally out of line with the \u201cdispositional\u201d requirement of Champagne. *1209Before termination was adjudicated in this case, certainly some consideration should have been given to \u201creasonable circumstances\u201d under which the \u201cchild\u2019s best interest\u201d can be served and to ways in which some visitation rights could be exercised by the father; and even if this were not the case, there is no need to terminate his legal rights of fatherhood.\n\n\nI would note that all of the cases cited in the majority to support the termination order in this case were decided before 1982, which is to say before Santosky and before Champagne. These cases have no bearing on the case now before us.\n\n",
