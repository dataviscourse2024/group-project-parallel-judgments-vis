On order of the Court, the case having been decided on\n  January 17, 2020, ___ Mich ___ (2020), the application is again considered and, pursuant\n  to MCR 7.305(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we REVERSE the judgment of\n  the Court of Appeals and we REMAND this case to the Kent Circuit Court for further\n  proceedings not inconsistent with this order. At the resentencing for first-degree murder\n  held pursuant to MCL 769.25a and Miller v Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012), the trial court\n  had jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding his sentences for\n  kidnapping and assault with intent to murder. Turner, supra. On remand, the trial court\n  shall consider the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the validity of these sentences and\n  exercise its discretion whether to resentence him for those convictions, in particular \u201cif it\n  finds that the sentence was based on a legal misconception that the defendant was\n  required to serve a mandatory sentence of life without parole on the greater offense.\u201d Id.\n\n         We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                           I, Larry S. Royster, Clerk of the Michigan Supreme Court, certify that the\n                     foregoing is a true and complete copy of the order entered at the direction of the Court.\n                           March 27, 2020\n           t0323\n                                                                               Clerk\n\f",
