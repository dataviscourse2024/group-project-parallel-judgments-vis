PENAL CODE ANN. ' 12.42(c)(2) (Vernon Supp. 2003) based upon\r\nthe jury=s determination that appellant had previously\r\nbeen convicted of similar offenses.\u00a0 In\r\nhis sole appellate issue, appellant alleges ineffective assistance of trial\r\ncounsel during the guilt/innocence phase.\u00a0\r\nWe affirm.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nE.T., a\r\nsix-year-old boy, testified that a man forced him to get inside a car on\r\nFebruary 11, 2001, at a location near the boy=s home.\u00a0 The only witnesses to\r\nthe kidnapping were other children who were E.T.=s siblings and neighborhood friends.\u00a0\r\nThe man sped away from the scene with E.T. The other children remained\r\nin the area where the kidnapping occurred for an undetermined\u00a0 period of time to see if the man would\r\nreturn E.T. to the area.\u00a0 They then\r\nreported the kidnapping to their babysitter.\u00a0\r\nThe babysitter, who was one of the children=s grandmother, initially did not believe\r\ntheir report of the kidnapping.\u00a0 Police\r\nofficers were subsequently dispatched to the scene at 3:12 p.m.\u00a0 Authorities were unable to locate E.T. until\r\nthe next day.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe\r\nkidnapper transported E.T. to a house whereupon he tied E.T. to a bed.\u00a0 E.T. stated that the kidnapper Awet his face@ at some point.\u00a0 The kidnapper\r\nsubsequently returned E.T. to E.T.=s neighborhood the next day.\u00a0\r\nSwabs taken of E.T.=s face revealed the presence of semen.\u00a0\r\nHis face was bruised as a result of the ordeal.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\nbecame a suspect as a result of the police receiving a Crime Stoppers= tip on February 23, 2001.\u00a0 Appellant was on maximum supervision parole\r\nat the time for previous rape convictions.\u00a0\r\nAppellant wore an electric monitoring device on the date of the\r\nkidnapping which kept track of the times he remained at home.\u00a0 This device did not record appellant=s whereabouts while he was away from\r\nhome.\u00a0 The monitoring device indicated\r\nthat appellant arrived at his home at 3:07 p.m. on the day of the kidnapping.\r\n\r\nWhile E.T.\r\ndid not identify appellant as his kdinapper at trial, police officers testified\r\nthat E.T. identified appellant during a video lineup.\u00a0 E.T. and the other children also identified appellant=s car as the one driven by the\r\nkidnapper.\u00a0 E.T.=s description of the kidnapper=s house and its contents was consistent with\r\nappellant=s house.\u00a0\r\nE.T. told the police that the man put Aorange grease@ on\r\nhis body.\u00a0 The police found a bottle of\r\norange coconut butter location in appellant=s bedroom.\u00a0 The State=s DNA expert testified that appellant=s DNA was consistent with the DNA extracted\r\nfrom the semen found on E.T.=s face.\u00a0 The expert further\r\ntestified that the odds of another individual being the contributor of the\r\nsemen to be 1 in 1.3 trillion.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant\r\ntestified in his own behalf at trial.\u00a0\r\nHe vehemently denied that he kidnapped and sexually assaulted E.T.\u00a0 Appellant testified that he traveled to his\r\ncousin=s grandmother=s house on the day of the kidnapping in order for his cousin to work on\r\nappellant=s car=s stereo system.\u00a0 His cousin=s grandmother=s house was located near the area where the kidnapping occurred.\u00a0 He stated that he arrived at his cousin=s grandmother=s house sometime around 10:30 a.m., that he left at approximately 2:30\r\np.m., and that he returned directly to his home by 3:07 p.m.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\npresented his ineffective assistance claim to the trial court in a motion for\r\nnew trial.\u00a0 The trial court overruled\r\nappellant=s complaint by denying the motion for new\r\ntrial.\u00a0 The only evidence offered at the\r\nhearing on the motion for new trial were affidavits received into evidence by\r\nthe trial court.\u00a0 See TEX.R.APP.P.\r\n21.7.\u00a0 Appellant=s evidence consisted of affidavits prepared\r\nby a DNA expert, of the testimony of one of appellant=s parole officers, and of appellant=s unsworn declaration submitted under the\r\nprovisions of TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. ' 132.001 et seq.\u00a0 (Vernon 1997 &amp; Supp. 2003).\u00a0\r\nThe DNA expert=s\r\naffidavit criticized the manner in which trial counsel handled the State=s presentation of the DNA evidence at\r\ntrial.\u00a0 The parole officer=s affidavit asserted that trial counsel\r\nfailed to elicit testimony from him which might have established an alibi for\r\nappellant. \u00a0Appellant=s declaration expressed his general\r\ndissatisfaction with trial counsel.[1]\u00a0 The State offered an affidavit from\r\nappellant=s trial counsel which responded to appellant=s charges.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prevail\r\non a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must establish\r\nthat his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\r\nreasonableness and that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d the result of the\r\nproceeding would have been different but for counsel\u2019s deficient\r\nperformance.\u00a0 Strickland v.

State, 65 S.W.3d 59, 62-63\r\n(Tex.Cr.App.2001).\u00a0 A reasonable\r\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\r\noutcome.\u00a0 Hernandez v. State, 726 S.W.2d\r\n53, 55 (Tex.Cr.App.1986).\u00a0 The purpose\r\nof this two-prong test is to judge whether counsel's conduct so compromised the\r\nproper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be said to\r\nhave produced a reliable result.\u00a0 Thompson\r\nv.

State, 928 S.W.2d 482, 500 (Tex.Cr.App.1996), cert.\r\nden=d, 519 U.S. 1119 (1997).\u00a0 We do\r\nnot review the Strickland standards in a de novo fashion; we review them\r\nthrough the prism of an abuse of discretion standard to determine whether the\r\ntrial court=s decision to deny the motion for new trial\r\nwas so outside the zone of reasonable disagreement that it is subject to\r\nreversal.\u00a0 State v. Gill, 967 S.W.2d\r\n540, 542 (Tex.App. B\r\nAustin 1998, pet=n ref=d).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appellant attacks various instances of trial counsel=s performance in his brief.\u00a0 The first matter involves an allegation that\r\ntrial counsel failed to elicit testimony from appellant=s parole officers regarding the fact that the\r\nelectric monitoring system indicated that he had returned home at 3:07 p.m. on\r\nthe day of the kidnapping.\u00a0 Trial\r\ncounsel=s affidavit stated as follows regarding his\r\nviews pertaining to the time appellant returned home:\r\n\r\nI did not\r\nspend a significant amount of time surrounding [appellant=s] arrival at his home on the date of the\r\noffense.\u00a0 This was done because it would\r\nnot eliminate [appellant] as being capable of committing the offenses\r\nalleged.\u00a0 The record was clear that\r\n[appellant] was in an area not too far from the kidnapping.\u00a0 The record was also clear that there were\r\nseveral intervening circumstances that took place prior to the kids eventually\r\ntelling [the babysitter], who then called the police.\u00a0 This would have allowed [appellant] to have more than enough time\r\nto travel from the kidnapping scene to his residence. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe record\r\ndoes not demonstrate within a reasonable degree of probability that the result\r\nwould have been different had this testimony been offered through the parole\r\nofficers.\u00a0 This evidence came before the\r\njury through other witnesses, primarily through appellant=s testimony.\u00a0\r\nThe State did not dispute appellant=s testimony as evidenced by the following dialogue between the\r\nprosecutor and appellant during cross-examination:\r\n\r\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you remember getting\r\nhome at 3:07, according to your monitor?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But in between 10:03 and\r\n3:07 you know you can=t be\r\ntracked; is that correct?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Say that again.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know that in between\r\n10:03 and 3:07 your whereabouts cannot be tracked; correct?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I know at 3:10\r\nthe child was picked up and I was home at 3:07, so I couldn=t have been there to pick up that child.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary\r\nto appellant=s above-quoted response, the record does not\r\nestablish that the kidnapping occurred at 3:10 p.m.\u00a0 The record establishes that the police received a report of the\r\nkidnapping at 3:12 p.m.\u00a0 The testimony\r\nof the other children indicated that the kidnapping had occurred sometime prior\r\nto the report to the police.\u00a0 The\r\nchildren first waited around the area where the kidnapping occurred to see if\r\nthe kidnapper would bring E.T. back before reporting the incident.\u00a0 The report to the police was further delayed\r\nby the babysitter=s\r\ninitial reluctance to believe their report.\u00a0\r\nAs a result of the delay between the kidnapping and the report to the\r\npolice, the evidence of appellant=s arrival at his house at 3:07 p.m. does not necessarily exclude him\r\nfrom being the kidnapper.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant\r\nadditionally complains that trial counsel elicited damaging testimony from his\r\nparole officers concerning his prior convictions and details of his previous\r\nlevel of surveillance while on parole.\u00a0\r\nThe record establishes that trial counsel called the parole officers to\r\ntestify at appellant=s\r\ninsistence.\u00a0 Trial counsel stated on the\r\nrecord during a discussion which occurred outside of the presence of the jury\r\nthat he had advised appellant against calling the parole officers as witnesses\r\nin order to avoid the introduction of evidence that appellant was on parole for\r\nmore than one previous sexual assault offense.[2]\u00a0 The trial court made the following statement\r\nto appellant regarding the consequences of the parole officers testifying:\u00a0 AI want to make sure you understand, Mr. Napper, if those folks get up\r\non the stand to testify clearly the jury is going to know you=re on parole.\u00a0 And I can B they are entitled to know what you=re on parole for.@ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial\r\ncounsel questioned the parole officers about appellant=s prior convictions during his direct\r\nexamination of them.\u00a0 Trial counsel also\r\nquestioned the parole officers about the details of the surveillance which they\r\nhad maintained on appellant.\u00a0 The parole\r\nofficers testified that, prior to the kidnapping, appellant had been monitored\r\nby an electronic tracking device which recorded his whereabouts at all times.\u00a0 Prosecutors developed testimony during\r\ncross-examination of the parole officers that very few parolees are monitored\r\nby these tracking devices.\u00a0 Appellant\r\ncontends that trial counsel should not have questioned the parole officers\r\nabout his prior convictions.\u00a0 He further\r\ncontends that trial counsel should have sought to exclude this testimony from\r\nbeing offered through the parole officers by asserting an objection under\r\nTEX.R.EVID. 403 based upon unfair prejudice.[3]\u00a0 Appellant also complains that trial counsel=s questions regarding the tracking device\r\npermitted prosecutors to develop testimony showing that appellant was\r\nconsidered to be a dangerous parolee.\u00a0\r\nAppellant additionally asserts that trial counsel should have asked the\r\ntrial court to give limiting instructions whenever the evidence of his prior\r\nconvictions and previous level of surveillance was admitted.\u00a0 Trial counsel stated in his affidavit that\r\nhe did not request limiting instructions in order to minimize the jury=s attention to these matters.\r\n\r\nOur review\r\nof the record does not indicate that trial counsel=s questioning of the parole officers\r\nregarding appellant=s\r\nprior convictions and the details of his parole fell below an objective level\r\nof reasonable performance.\u00a0 As noted\r\nabove, the trial court had previously informed appellant and trial counsel that\r\nit would permit the admission of evidence of appellant=s prior convictions if the parole officers\r\ntestified.\u00a0 Trial counsel=s decision to address the unfavorable facts\r\nconcerning appellant=s\r\nparole during the direct examination of the parole officers was not\r\nunreasonable because these facts most likely would have been addressed by the\r\nprosecutors during cross-examination.\u00a0\r\nFurthermore, trial counsel did not want to call the parole officers as\r\nwitnesses as a part of his trial strategy.\u00a0\r\nHe only called them as witnesses at appellant=s insistence after appellant had been warned\r\nof the adverse consequences of which appellant now complains on appeal.\u00a0 When a defendant preempts his attorney=s strategy by insisting that a different defense\r\nbe followed, no claim of ineffectiveness can be made.\u00a0 See Duncan v. State, 717 S.W.2d 345, 348 (Tex.Cr.App.1986).\u00a0 The record further does not conclusively\r\nestablish that the trial court would have sustained a Rule 403 objection to\r\nthese matters as the trial court exercises broad discretion in applying the\r\nrule.\u00a0 See Moreno v. State, 22 S.W.3d\r\n482, 487 (Tex.Cr.App.1999); Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 389\r\n(Tex.Cr.App.1991).\u00a0 With respect to\r\ntrial counsel=s decision to not request limiting instructions,\r\ncourts have recognized that counsel=s desire to not remind the jury of adverse matters is a reasonable\r\ntrial tactic.\u00a0 See Ali v. State, 26\r\nS.W.3d 82, 87 (Tex.App. B Waco 2000, no pet=n).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nremainder of appellant=s\r\nineffective assistance claim attacks trial counsel=s handling\u00a0\r\nof the State=s DNA\r\nevidence. The State presented its DNA evidence through the testimony of Mary\r\nChilds-Henry and Joseph Chu.\u00a0\r\nChilds-Henry, a forensic biologist/serologist with the Houston Police\r\nDepartment Crime Laboratory, identified the swabs from E.T.=s face as containing semen. Childs-Henry was\r\nable to extract a sufficient amount of DNA from the facial swabs for comparison\r\npurposes.\u00a0 Chu, a DNA analyst with the\r\nHouston Police Department Crime Laboratory, determined that the DNA extracted\r\nfrom the facial swabs was consistent with appellant=s DNA sample. \r\n\r\nTrial\r\ncounsel obtained authorization from the trial court to retain a DNA expert at\r\nthe State=s expense.\u00a0\r\nHowever, trial counsel ultimately did not retain a DNA expert.\u00a0 Trial counsel stated in his affidavit that\r\none of the prosecutors advised him that no DNA sample remained from the swab of\r\nE.T.=s cheek to be tested by the defense.\u00a0 Trial counsel decided not to retain a DNA\r\nexpert because of the lack of a sample for independent testing.\u00a0 Trial counsel stated as follows in this\r\nregard: \r\n\r\nI felt that it was not in [appellant=s] best interest to utilize an expert to\r\nconduct an independent analysis of the procedures used by the State.\u00a0 I reached this conclusion because I was of\r\nthe opinion that, as trial strategy, I could effectively argue the unfairness\r\nof no sample being available for the defense to analyze.\u00a0 I also believed that if there were some\r\nissues with regard to methodologies and procedures, I could get more mileage\r\nout of this on cross examination.\u00a0 The\r\ndistinct possibility that our expert would confirm the propriety of the State=s methodologies and procedures during the\r\nlaboratory testing, thereby reinforcing the validity of the d.n.a. results, was\r\nalso a concern that I had.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAppellant=s contention with regard to the DNA evidence\r\nis based on the affidavit of Dr. Elizabeth A. Johnson, a DNA expert from\r\nCalifornia.[4]\u00a0 Dr. Johnson=s affidavit asserts numerous deficiencies with respect to trial counsel=s handling of the DNA evidence.\u00a0 She contends that the testimony of\r\nChilds-Henry and Chu was weak and poorly cross-examined.\u00a0 Dr. Johnson asserted that she has reviewed\r\nnumerous other cases involving analyses performed by Childs-Henry and Chu and\r\nthat she has detected serious errors in their work in most of these other\r\ncases.\u00a0 She concluded her affidavit by\r\nstating as follows: \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the testing and analysis of\r\nthe [Houston Police Department] lab in this case is potentially seriously\r\nflawed, and may contain errors that could have resulted incorrect conclusions\r\n(sic) that were reported and testified to in trial.\u00a0 The lack of adequate cross-examination of the scientific\r\nwitnesses by defense counsel does not allow the jury to have an understanding\r\nof these potential flaws or bias on the part of the [Houston Police Department]\r\nlab staff. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Dr.\r\nJohnson=s affidavit criticizes trial counsel=s performance, it does not allege any actual\r\nerrors in Childs-Henry=s and\r\nChu=s work which trial counsel failed to discover\r\nor develop.\u00a0 She instead only cites\r\npotential errors in their analyses which may have occurred.\u00a0 The record, therefore, does not show within\r\na reasonable degree of probability that the results of the proceeding would\r\nhave been different but for trial counsel=s allegedly deficient performance.\u00a0\r\nMoreover, the record does not affirmatively establish that trial counsel=s performance fell below an objective\r\nstandard of reasonableness with respect to the DNA evidence.\u00a0 Trial counsel strenuously cross-examined the\r\npolice officers who obtained the facial swabs from E.T. in an effort to suggest\r\nthat the manner in which the swabs were handled did not prevent them from being\r\ncontaminated.\u00a0 He also emphasized the\r\nlack of a remaining sample for appellant to test independently.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn\r\nsummary, the record does not establish that trial counsel=s performance fell below an objective\r\nstandard of reasonableness.\u00a0\r\nFurthermore, the evidence of appellant=s guilt was ample.\u00a0 The\u00a0 record does not demonstrate within a\r\nreasonable degree of probability that the result of the proceedings would have\r\nbeen different irrespective of the matters asserted by appellant.\u00a0 Appellant=s sole appellate issue is overruled.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\njudgments of the trial court are affirmed.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPER\r\nCURIAM\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDecember 19, 2002\r\n\r\nDo not publish.\u00a0 See TEX.R.APP.P. 47.3(b).\r\n\r\nPanel consists of:\u00a0 Arnot, C.J., and\r\n\r\nWright, J., and McCall, J.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [1]The reporter=s\r\nrecord indicated that appellant made repeated\u00a0\r\noutbursts during the proceedings which expressed his disagreement with\r\ntrial counsel and the proceedings in general.\u00a0\r\nAppellant had to be removed from the courtroom on at least one occasion\r\nas a result of these outbursts.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [2]This discussion outside of the jury=s presence also addressed trial counsel=s recommendation to appellant not to testify in order\r\nto prevent the jury from learning about his prior convictions.\u00a0 Appellant stated in the declaration attached\r\nto his motion for new trial that the only reason he testified at trial was due\r\nto trial counsel=s failure to obtain the arrival time testimony from the\r\nparole officers.\u00a0 However, the record\r\nreflects that appellant intended to testify before the parole officers ever\r\ntook the stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [3]Rule 403 provides:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlthough\r\nrelevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\r\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\r\nmisleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless\r\npresentation of cumulative evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [4]Dr. Johnson stated in her affidavit that she\r\nestablished the DNA analysis laboratory within the Harris County Medical\r\nExaminer=s Office.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
