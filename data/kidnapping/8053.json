REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n      Martha J. Lucey, State Appellate Defender, and Josh Irwin, Assistant\n\nAppellate Defender, for appellant.\n\n      Brenna Bird, Attorney General, and Timothy M.

With that\n\nevidence, a jury convicted Rawlins of simple assault and domestic abuse assault\n\ncausing bodily injury. Rawlins appeals both convictions,1 raising several claims,\n\nincluding that the district court erred in admitting the body-cam footage because it\n\ncontained testimonial statements that violated his right to confrontation.      We\n\nreverse and remand for a new trial.\n\nI.     Background Facts and Proceedings\n\n       On November 23, 2021, at 2:17 a.m., an unidentified female called 911 and\n\nprovided the address of an apartment as it was being told to her by someone else.\n\nAfter receiving the address, the dispatcher questioned: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d\n\nThe caller responded in a hushed and hurried voice: \u201cI\u2014it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s bad, uhm.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher told the caller that she could barely hear her, and the caller\n\nresponded: \u201cI know, I\u2014I need you guys to be here real soon.\u201d The dispatcher\n\nasked what was happening, and the caller answered that \u201csomeone is assaulting\n\nsomeone else.\u201d Faint yelling could be heard in the background. When asked\n\nwhether any weapons were involved, the caller said that she didn\u2019t know for sure.\n\n       In response to further questions, the caller explained it was \u201cmale versus\n\nfemale,\u201d the suspect\u2019s name was \u201cMatt,\u201d and he was assaulting his wife, who had\n\nasked her to call 911. The dispatcher then asked for a description of \u201cMatt\u201d in case\n\n\n\n1 Rawlins was granted discretionary review as to his conviction for simple assault.\n\f                                         3\n\n\nhe took off. The caller said he was white and 6\u20192\u201d. After the dispatcher asked what\n\nhe was wearing, the yelling in the background got louder. There was a long pause,\n\nand then the caller said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d The yelling escalated, continuing until the\n\ncall ended.\n\n       The dispatcher classified the call \u201cas a priority one, domestic fight,\u201d which\n\nmeant it would be \u201cdispatched immediately\u201d because the caller \u201csaid there was an\n\nassault currently taking place.\u201d Officer Tyler Kelley got to the apartment around\n\n2:20 a.m., about three minutes after the call came in. Footage from the officer\u2019s\n\nbody cam shows that he was met at the front door of the apartment by a black\n\nmale. Officer Kelley immediately asked: \u201cAnybody yelling in here or anything?\u201d\n\nThe male calmly responded, \u201cUh, yeah, there was a little bit of shouting going on,\u201d\n\nas he led the officer into the apartment. Officer Kelley followed the male into the\n\nliving room, where one female was sitting on a couch and another was sitting on a\n\nchair in the corner with a towel over her mouth. Officer Kelley asked, \u201cIs the\n\nproblem still here?\u201d The male and one of the females simultaneously responded.\n\nThe female stated: \u201cI think he went out the door, I think he went out the downstairs\n\ndoor,\u201d while the male said: \u201cUh, no, he went out the back door. Like right when he\n\nsaw a car pull up, man he just wigged out.\u201d\n\n       Officer Kelley then questioned: \u201cSo what happened I guess, or what\u2019s, just\n\nyelling or what\u2019s going on?\u201d The female in the corner with the towel over her mouth\n\nresponded: \u201cNo, he physically\u2014he knocked my tooth out, he busted me in the\n\nface.\u201d The other female stated: \u201cHer nose is all bruised.\u201d Officer Kelley responded,\n\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d and pulled out his pen and notepad while another officer asked:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he wearing?\u201d The group collectively responded jeans and a green hoodie.\n\f                                         4\n\n\nOfficer Kelley asked the injured female her relationship with the suspect, and she\n\nsaid they were husband and wife. He then asked for her name, date of birth, and\n\nphone number, as well as \u201chis name,\u201d date of birth, and residence. She gave the\n\nofficer that information, identifying Rawlins by name. Officer Kelley wrote the\n\ninformation down as it was given to him and asked again, \u201cAlright so what\n\nhappened tonight?\u201d Rawlins\u2019s wife described the assault in more detail, with some\n\ninput from the other two witnesses.\n\n       A warrant was issued for Rawlins\u2019s arrest, and he was caught about one\n\nweek later. In late December, Rawlins\u2019s wife moved to terminate the no-contact\n\norder issued after his arrest. She stated, \u201cI have thought long and hard and have\n\ndecided to recant any previous statements I have made. I will not testify against\n\nmy husband in any further proceedings.\u201d           The State proceeded with its\n\nprosecution, filing a trial information in January 2022 that charged Rawlins with\n\nassault without intent causing serious injury, first-degree harassment, and\n\ndomestic abuse assault causing bodily injury. The trial information was later\n\namended to remove the harassment charge.\n\n       After the three witnesses at the apartment failed to appear for defense\n\ndepositions, the State moved for a preliminary determination of the admissibility of\n\nthe 911 call and body-cam footage under Iowa Rule of Evidence 5.104. The State\n\nargued the statements made in those recordings would not violate the\n\nConfrontation Clause if the witnesses were unavailable for trial because they were\n\n\u201cmade during an ongoing emergency investigation\u201d and were therefore\n\nnontestimonial. As for the hearsay obstacle to admissibility, the State argued the\n\nstatements qualified as present sense impressions, excited utterances, and\n\f                                          5\n\n\nresidual hearsay. Rawlins resisted, asserting the statements were testimonial\n\nhearsay not subject to an exception.\n\n       An evidentiary hearing was held in May, at which the 911 call, the full thirty-\n\nminute version of the body-cam footage, and Officer Kelley\u2019s deposition were\n\nadmitted. The court also admitted the State\u2019s redacted body-cam video, clocking\n\nin at about twelve minutes, that omitted the parts where the officer was \u201csitting in\n\nhis car or walking back and forth.\u201d After considering this evidence, the court ruled\n\nthat the statements made during the 911 call and the first 2:25 minutes of the\n\nState\u2019s redacted body-cam video\u2014up until Officer Kelley asked a second time,\n\n\u201cAlright so what happened tonight?\u201d\u2014were nontestimonial. The court deferred\n\nruling on whether those statements met a hearsay exception, but definitively\n\nexcluded any statements after the 2:25 mark \u201cabsent production by the State of\n\nthe declarants at trial so that they are available for cross-examination.\u201d\n\n       On the morning of trial a few weeks later, Rawlins filed a motion in limine\n\nrequesting exclusion of (1) the body-cam video \u201cafter the :46 second mark\u201d\u2014when\n\nthe officer learned Rawlins had fled\u2014on confrontation and hearsay grounds, and\n\n(2) all of the 911 call as hearsay. The court stood by the prior ruling as to Rawlins\u2019s\n\nconfrontation argument with the body-cam video and reserved ruling on the\n\nhearsay issues. After jury selection, but before opening statements, the State\n\npresented testimony from dispatcher Kelli Larkins, who received the 911 call, and\n\nOfficer Kelley in an offer of proof. With this additional information, the court denied\n\nRawlins\u2019s motion in limine, concluding the statements in the 911 call and body cam\n\nwere excepted from the hearsay rule as present sense impressions.\n\f                                         6\n\n\n       Knowing that evidence was coming in, the defense focused its opening\n\nstatement on the witnesses the State was not calling at trial:\n\n              When [O]fficer Kelley arrived, there was not one, not two, but\n       three people in that apartment. You shouldn\u2019t expect to hear from\n       any of them. You won\u2019t be able to judge whether or not they\u2019re telling\n       you the truth, whether or not they\u2019re lying, whether or not this was a\n       story\u2014nothing\u2014because they won\u2019t be here. You won\u2019t be able to\n       hear explanations as to why they said some things. Why won\u2019t you\n       hear from any of them? We don\u2019t know.\n\n       Consistent with the defense\u2019s expectation, the State\u2019s evidence did not\n\ninclude the three witnesses at the apartment. Instead, the State admitted the 911\n\ncall through dispatcher Larkins\u2019s testimony, and the first 2:25 minutes of the body-\n\ncam video through Officer Kelley\u2019s testimony. Larkins also testified that in her\n\nopinion, the female caller was \u201cscared, very hesitant to talk,\u201d and \u201c[t]here was\n\nyelling in the background\u201d from someone who \u201csounded like a male.\u201d And she\n\nagreed that it appeared \u201cthe caller was reporting what was happening in the\n\nmoment\u201d\u2014a \u201cmale assaulting his wife.\u201d For his part, Officer Kelley testified that\n\nwhen he got to the apartment, Rawlins\u2019s wife \u201cwas sitting in a chair. She had a\n\ntowel over her mouth because her mouth was still bleeding from getting a tooth\n\nknocked out by the defendant, and she was kind of like cowering in the corner with\n\nthe towel over her mouth.\u201d Based on her body language, Officer Kelley thought\n\nthat she was \u201cfearful that Mr. Rawlins, the defendant, would return and possibly\n\nassault her further.\u201d And the officer was concerned for her safety \u201cbecause at that\n\npoint [he] was unable to locate the defendant.\u201d Before going to look for Rawlins,\n\nhowever, Officer Kelley took pictures of the wife\u2019s injuries, which were also\n\nadmitted into evidence.\n\f                                         7\n\n\n         The jury found Rawlins guilty of the lesser-included offense of simple\n\nassault under count one and domestic abuse assault causing bodily injury under\n\ncount two. Rawlins appealed following the imposition of sentence.\n\nII.      Analysis\n\n         Although Rawlins raises other issues on appeal, which we will touch on as\n\nthey may arise on remand for new trial, his confrontation claim under the federal\n\nand state constitutions is dispositive.2 We review that constitutional claim de novo.\n\nSee State v. Montgomery, 966 N.W.2d 641, 649 (Iowa 2021).\n\n         \u201cThe Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, which is binding on the\n\nStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: \u2018In all criminal prosecutions,\n\nthe accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against\n\nhim.\u2019\u201d    Ohio v. Clark, 576 U.S. 237, 243 (2015) (alteration in original).     The\n\namendment \u201cprohibits the introduction of testimonial statements by a nontestifying\n\nwitness, unless the witness is \u2018unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a\n\nprior opportunity for cross-examination.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Crawford v. Washington, 541\n\nU.S. 36, 54 (2004)). Since that formulation of the amendment was adopted in\n\nCrawford, \u201c[m]uch of modern confrontation clause jurisprudence turns on the\n\nquestion of whether the evidence is \u2018testimonial\u2019 in nature.\u201d State v. Veverka, 938\n\nN.W.2d 197, 202 (Iowa 2020); accord Clark, 576 U.S. at 244 (\u201cOur more recent\n\n\n\n\n2 Because Rawlins has not argued article 1, section 10 of the Iowa Constitution\n\nshould be interpreted differently than the Confrontation Clause in the Sixth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cwe construe the provisions\nidentically.\u201d State v. Shipley, 757 N.W.2d 228, 234 (Iowa 2008).\n\f                                           8\n\n\ncases have labored to flesh out what it means for a statement to be \u2018testimonial.\u2019\u201d).\n\nAnd so it is here.3\n\n       In answering that question, we are guided by the United States Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s combined decisions in Davis v. Washington and Hammon v. Indiana, 547\n\nU.S. 813 (2006), a pair of domestic-violence cases. In Davis, the Court considered\n\nwhether statements made by a victim during a 911 call were testimonial, 547 U.S.\n\nat 817\u201318, while in Hammon, the Court examined statements made by a victim at\n\nthe scene of the domestic disturbance with her husband in a different room. Id.\n\nat 819\u201320. \u201cTo address the facts of both cases,\u201d the court \u201cexpanded on the\n\nmeaning of \u2018testimonial\u2019\u201d and \u201cdiscussed the concept of an ongoing emergency,\u201d\n\nexplaining:\n\n       Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police\n       interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the\n       primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to\n       meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the\n       circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing\n       emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to\n       establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal\n       prosecution.\n\nMichigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. 344, 356 (2011) (quoting Davis, 547 U.S. at 822).\n\nCourts are to \u201cobjectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter\n\noccurs and the statements and actions of the parties\u201d in determining the primary\n\npurpose of an interrogation. Id. at 359.\n\n\n3 On appeal, Rawlins also contends the \u201cState failed to establish the declarants\n\nwere unavailable.\u201d We agree with the State that this claim was not raised or\ndecided in district court, so we will not address it on appeal. See State v. Bynum,\n937 N.W.2d 319, 324 (Iowa 2020) (noting that even with constitutional issues, \u201c[i]t\nis a fundamental doctrine of appellate review that issues must ordinarily be both\nraised and decided by the district court before we decide them on appeal\u201d (citation\nomitted)).\n\f                                           9\n\n\n       The existence of an ongoing emergency at the time of the police encounter,\n\nwhile not determinative, \u201cis among the most important circumstances informing the\n\n\u2018primary purpose\u2019 of an interrogation.\u201d Id. at 361; accord Clark, 576 U.S. at 245\n\n(noting an ongoing emergency \u201cis simply one factor\u201d that informs the inquiry\n\n(quoting Bryant, 562 U.S. at 366)). This is because \u201can emergency focuses the\n\nparticipants on something other than proving past events potentially relevant to\n\nlater criminal prosecution,\u201d that being \u201cending a threatening situation.\u201d Bryant, 562\n\nU.S. at 361 (cleaned up). \u201c[W]hether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a\n\nhighly context-dependent inquiry.\u201d Id. at 363. Domestic-violence cases\u2014like this\n\none\u2014\u201chave a narrower zone of potential victims than cases involving threats to\n\npublic safety,\u201d according to the Supreme Court. Id. As a result, the Court has\n\n\u201cfocused only on the threat to the victims and assessed the ongoing emergency\n\nfrom the perspective of whether there was a continuing threat to them.\u201d Id. The\n\nuse of a weapon also affects whether there is an ongoing emergency, as does the\n\nmedical condition of the declarant. Id. at 364. And, notably for this case, nothing\n\n\u201csuggests that an emergency is ongoing in every place or even just surrounding\n\nthe victim for the entire time that the perpetrator of a violent crime is on the loose.\u201d\n\nId. at 365. In the end, \u201cthe existence and duration of an emergency depend on the\n\ntype and scope of danger posed to the victim, the police, and the public.\u201d Id.\n\nat 370\u201371.\n\n       Under those principles, the Court in Davis found that statements made by\n\na victim in a 911 call during and shortly after her boyfriend\u2019s attack were not\n\ntestimonial. 547 U.S. at 829. Significant to the Court\u2019s reasoning was that the\n\ncaller \u201cwas speaking about events as they were actually happening, rather than\n\f                                          10\n\n\ndescribing past events.\u201d Id. at 827 (cleaned up). And her \u201ccall was plainly a call\n\nfor help against bona fide physical threat,\u201d with the questions asked and the\n\nanswers given \u201cnecessary to be able to resolve the present emergency, rather than\n\nsimply to learn . . . what had happened in the past.\u201d Id. In contrast, the statements\n\nmade by the victim in Hammon at the scene of the domestic disturbance with her\n\nassailant in a different room were testimonial. Id. at 830. Unlike Davis,\n\n       There was no emergency in progress; the interrogating officer\n       testified that he had heard no arguments or crashing and saw no one\n       throw or break anything. When the officers first arrived, [the victim]\n       told them that things were fine, and there was no immediate threat\n       to her person. When the officer questioned [her] for the second time,\n       and elicited the challenged statements, he was not seeking to\n       determine (as in Davis) \u201cwhat is happening,\u201d but rather \u201cwhat\n       happened.\u201d Objectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole,\n       purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime . . . .\n\nId. at 829\u201330. Also key to the Court\u2019s decision was that the assailant in Hammon\n\n\u201cwas armed only with his fists when he attacked his wife,\u201d so removing her \u201cto a\n\nseparate room was sufficient to end the emergency.\u201d Bryant, 562 U.S. at 364.\n\n       So let\u2019s look at what happened here. Immediately after Officer Kelley\n\nentered the apartment and asked the witnesses, \u201cIs the problem still here?\u201d he was\n\ntold that Rawlins had left. Rawlins argues \u201c[f]rom that point on, Kelley\u2019s questions\n\nand the corresponding responses were not addressing any ongoing emergency;\n\ntheir primary purpose was to establish or prove past events in a criminal\n\nprosecution.\u201d In response, the State asserts there was an ongoing emergency,\n\npointing to Rawlins\u2019s recent flight, his unknown whereabouts, and the concern that\n\nhe would return to the apartment and carry out his threat of murder-suicide\u2014a\n\nthreat the officer only learned about toward the end of the interaction, in the portion\n\nof the body-cam video the district court excluded from evidence.\n\f                                          11\n\n\n       But in making this argument, the State acknowledges the emergency was\n\n\u201cat a pause\u201d when the challenged statements were made. After Officer Kelley\n\nlearned that Rawlins had fled, his focus turned investigative when he asked, \u201cSo\n\nwhat happened I guess, or what\u2019s just yelling or what\u2019s going on?\u201d See id. at 365\n\n(noting a conversation that begins as an inquiry to determine the need for\n\nemergency assistance can evolve into testimonial statements). He was not trying\n\nto find out where Rawlins could have gone so that officers could end any threat;\n\ninstead, he was trying to establish the circumstances of the assault\u2014\u201cwhat\n\nhappened,\u201d not \u201cwhat was happening.\u201d             Davis, 547 U.S. at 830; accord\n\nCommonwealth v. Wilson, 113 N.E.3d 902, 915 (Mass. Ct. App. 2018) (noting\n\nofficer\u2019s concern \u201cabout the defendant\u2019s whereabouts was satisfied when the\n\ndefendant\u2019s wife told him that the defendant had left the scene,\u201d with the rest of the\n\nconversation focused on historical facts about the crime).\n\n       At that point, there was no indication of an immediate ongoing threat to the\n\nvictim, the police, or the public.     See State v. Bassett, No. 21-0923, 2022\n\nWL 16630788, at *7 (Iowa Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2022) (finding no emergency where\n\nvictim advised officers that her boyfriend left, thus \u201creducing the risk both to herself\n\nand the deputies\u201d). Rawlins had fled the scene in his vehicle, a weapon was not\n\ninvolved, and the victim did not need medical attention. See Andrade v. United\n\nStates, 106 A.3d 386, 389 (D.C. Ct. App. 2015) (relying on the same\n\ncircumstances as support for the conclusion that there was no ongoing\n\nemergency); cf. State v. Richards, No. 18-0522, 2019 WL 1057886, at *5 (Iowa Ct.\n\nApp. Mar. 6, 2019) (determining statements captured on body-cam video were\n\nnontestimonial where declarant, who was distraught, crying, shaking, bleeding,\n\f                                         12\n\n\nand transported to the hospital, told officers the assailant had a gun and wanted\n\nher to die). It was not until later in the interview that Rawlins\u2019s wife mentioned her\n\nfear that he would come back. Her answers before then were simply describing\n\nthe circumstances of the past event. See Andrade, 106 A.3d at 391 (finding\n\nvictim\u2019s answers to an officer\u2019s questions did not \u201csuggest a focus on dealing with\n\nan emergency\u201d where she \u201cdid not request medical assistance\u201d or \u201cask the police\n\nto take any other emergency steps,\u201d but \u201csimply described the circumstances of\n\nthe earlier incident\u201d); cf. State v. London, No. 13-1461, 2014 WL 5475727, at *7\n\n(Iowa Ct. App. Oct. 29, 2014) (finding primary purpose of officer\u2019s questions \u201cwas\n\nto \u2018enable him to assess the situation and to meet the needs of the victim,\u2019\u201d where\n\nthe officer found the victim on the floor \u201ccrying, upset, and worked up\u201d in a pool of\n\nblood and the victim kept repeating that she had been hit with a bat by the\n\ndefendant, who had fled (citation omitted)); State v. Moore, No. 10-1283, 2012\n\nWL 3194116, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2012) (concluding victim\u2019s statements\n\nto emergency personnel and an officer at the scene were nontestimonial where\n\nmade \u201cin the context of seeking help for injuries and protection from Moore, not as\n\npart of a police investigation\u201d).\n\n       We have also considered the formality of the interview. While it took place\n\nin the victim\u2019s living room, her statements \u201cdeliberately recounted, in response to\n\npolice questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed,\u201d\n\nsome time after the events described were over. Davis, 547 U.S. at 830. And\n\nafter he asked what happened, Officer Kelley pulled out his note pad and pen and\n\ntook notes about those past events. All of this is more like the \u201cformal station-\n\nhouse interrogation in Crawford\u201d than the more spontaneous statements made\n\f                                       13\n\n\nduring the 911 call in Davis or the statements made in Bryant by a man \u201clying in a\n\ngas station parking lot bleeding from a mortal gunshot wound to his abdomen.\u201d\n\nBryant, 562 U.S. at 366, 375.\n\n       Considering all these circumstances, we find this case is closer to the\n\ntestimonial statements in Hammon than the nontestimonial statements in Davis.\n\nOther courts have reached the same conclusion in circumstances comparable to\n\nthis one. See, e.g., Andrade, 106 A.3d at 391\u201392 (collecting cases); see also\n\nWilson, 113 N.E.3d at 917 (finding no ongoing emergency after officer learned the\n\ndefendant had left and then gathered information about what happened from the\n\nvictim).    Because the portion of the video allowed into evidence contained\n\ntestimonial statements by declarants that were unavailable and not subject to\n\ncross-examination, we agree with Rawlins that his right to confrontation was\n\nviolated.\n\n       This does not end our inquiry, however, because reversal is not mandated\n\nif the State proves the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State\n\nv. Newell, 710 N.W.2d 6, 25 (Iowa 2006). We find the State has not met that\n\nburden, considering that the body-cam video was the lynchpin of the State\u2019s case,\n\nwhich was not strong. Id. (considering the importance of the evidence, whether it\n\nwas cumulative, the presence or absence of corroborating or contradictory\n\nevidence, the extent of cross-examination, and the overall strength of the\n\nprosecution\u2019s case). While the video may have been cumulative to some of the\n\nother properly admitted evidence in the record\u2014like photographs of the victim\u2019s\n\ninjuries\u2014the officer\u2019s testimony was based on the same statements in the video\n\nthat we found should have been excluded.           See State v. Kennedy, 846\n\f                                         14\n\n\nN.W.2d 517, 528 (Iowa 2014) (considering whether the inadmissible evidence was\n\ncumulative to the admissible evidence). We accordingly find the State failed to\n\nprove the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As a result, we reverse\n\nand remand for a new trial.         See State v. Martinez, No. 21-0145, 2022\n\nWL 1487594, at *5\u20136 (Iowa Ct. App. May 11, 2022).\n\nIII.   Other Issues\n\n       Although Rawlins\u2019s convictions must be reversed, we will address his claim\n\nregarding the 911 call recording because that issue is likely to come up on\n\nremand,4 see State v. Dudley, 766 N.W.2d 606, 615 (Iowa 2009), as well as a\n\nmerger question that implicates double jeopardy.\n\n       A.     Hearsay\u2014911 Call\n\n       Rawlins claims the district court erred in admitting the recording of the 911\n\ncall because it contains hearsay not subject to any exception.         See State v.\n\nMaldonado, 993 N.W.2d 379, 384 (Iowa Ct. App. 2023) (reviewing district court\u2019s\n\nevidentiary ruling on hearsay for errors at law). The court found the statements\n\nmade in the 911 call met the exception for present sense impressions, which\n\napplies to \u201c[a] statement describing or explaining an event or condition, made while\n\nor immediately after the declarant perceived it.\u201d Iowa R. Evid. 5.803(1). Rawlins\n\n\n\n4 We do not address Rawlins\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in\n\nadmitting testimony from a detective about why, in general, a domestic-assault\nvictim may be reluctant to testify at trial. Unlike the record for the 911 call\nrecording, the record on the detective\u2019s testimony may be different on retrial, so\nthere is not much benefit in addressing the issue now. See Sauer v. Scott, 176\nN.W.2d 140, 145 (Iowa 1970) (\u201cThe record may well be different on retrial and the\nquestion of whether the proper foundation was laid [for expert testimony] will arise,\nif at all, in a different context.\u201d); accord State v. Hart, 966 N.W.2d 304, 309 n.6\n(Iowa Ct. App. 2021).\n\f                                        15\n\n\nchallenges this finding because \u201cno evidence established where the caller was in\n\nrelation to the events, whether the caller was personally observing the things\n\ndescribed, or when they were observed.\u201d We disagree.\n\n      The 911 recording itself discloses that the caller was near the altercation.\n\nThe male suspect can be heard yelling in the background throughout the recording,\n\nmore muffled at first, but then louder and more clearly later on. The recording\n\nestablishes the caller was in the apartment, perceiving the events as they\n\noccurred, and explaining them to dispatch while, or immediately after, they\n\noccurred. See State v. Dessinger, 958 N.W.2d 590, 600 (Iowa 2021) (stating the\n\nrationale underlying the exception for present sense impressions \u201cis that the\n\ndeclarant has no opportunity to fabricate a statement if the statement is made\n\nduring or \u2018immediately\u2019 after the event\u201d (quoting Fratzke v. Meyer, 398 N.W.2d 200,\n\n205 (Iowa Ct. App. 1986)). As for Rawlins\u2019s complaint about the caller\u2019s unknown\n\nidentity, since the declarant need not be available for admission as a present sense\n\nimpression, \u201clack of knowledge of the identity of declarant should not be a bar to\n\nadmission of the unknown declarant\u2019s statement under the hearsay rules where\n\nthe statement and surrounding circumstances indicate firsthand observation by the\n\ndeclarant.\u201d    Laurie Kratky Dor\u00e9, Iowa Practice Series: Evidence \u00a7 5.803:1\n\n(Nov. 2022 update). We accordingly find no error in admitting the recording of the\n\n911 call as a present sense impression.\n\n      B.      Merger\n\n      Finally, Rawlins claims that his conviction for simple assault should have\n\nmerged into his conviction for domestic abuse assault causing bodily injury under\n\nIowa Code section 701.9 and Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.6(2).\n\f                                          16\n\n\nSection 701.9\u2014a codification of \u201cthe double jeopardy protection against\n\ncumulative punishment,\u201d State v. Anderson, 565 N.W.2d 340, 344 (Iowa 1997)\u2014\n\nprovides:\n\n              No person shall be convicted of a public offense which is\n       necessarily included in another public offense of which the person is\n       convicted. If the jury returns a verdict of guilty of more than one\n       offense and such verdict conflicts with this section, the court shall\n       enter judgment of guilty of the greater of the offenses only.\n\nRule 2.6(2) similarly states, \u201cUpon prosecution for a public offense, the defendant\n\nmay be convicted of either the public offense charged or an included offense, but\n\nnot both.\u201d\n\n       Rawlins argues that \u201c[b]ecause the elements of assault are included within\n\nthe elements of domestic abuse assault causing bodily injury, assault is a lesser\n\nincluded offense.\u201d See State v. Folck, 325 N.W.2d 368, 375 (Iowa 1982) (\u201cOne\n\ncrime is included within another when the lesser is composed solely of some, but\n\nnot all, of the elements of the greater and when the greater offense cannot be\n\ncommitted without committing the lesser.\u201d). The State does not contest that point,\n\narguing instead that \u201cthere is no double jeopardy problem\u201d because the \u201ctrial record\n\nsupported . . . the jury\u2019s verdict [that] he assaulted [the victim] multiple times.\u201d See\n\nState v. Zmuda, No. 11-0563, 2012 WL 470201, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App.\n\nFeb. 15, 2012) (\u201cDouble jeopardy principles . . . do not apply when a defendant is\n\nconvicted of multiple offenses for different assaults.\u201d); accord State v. McKettrick,\n\n480 N.W.2d 52, 56 n.2 (Iowa 1992); State v. Delap, 466 N.W.2d 264, 266 (Iowa\n\nCt. App. 1990).\n\n       The State is correct that where \u201cthe alleged acts occur separately and\n\nconstitute distinct offenses, there can be no complaint one is a lesser-included\n\f                                         17\n\n\noffense of the other.\u201d State v. Flanders, 546 N.W.2d 221, 224 (Iowa Ct. App. 1996)\n\n(noting the \u201clesser-included offense analysis addresses situations where multiple\n\ncharges apply to a single occurrence\u201d). The problem is the case was not presented\n\nto the jury in that way. See id. at 225 (\u201cThe State can convict a defendant of both\n\nkidnapping in the first degree and sexual abuse if there are separate and distinct\n\noccurrences of sexual abuse and the case is presented in a manner that requires\n\nthe fact finder to make separate factual findings the separate and distinct\n\noccurrences happened.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n       In its opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury:\n\n              On November 23, 2021, the defendant got into an altercation\n       with his wife. . . . This altercation turned physical when the defendant\n       struck his wife in the face. This gave her a bloody nose, knocked out\n       one of her teeth, and, from that wound, blood poured out.\n\nAnd in closing, the prosecutor argued: \u201cWe\u2019ve proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nall elements of both counts. On November 23, 2023, the defendant assaulted his\n\nwife. He intended to strike her; and, when he did, he caused her to lose a tooth.\u201d\n\n       So while there may have been multiple injuries, as the State asserts on\n\nappeal,5 the State did not argue that there were multiple acts causing those\n\ninjuries. See State v. Negrete-Ramirez, No. 07-1059, 2008 WL 4531532, at *2\n\n(Iowa Ct. App. Oct. 1, 2008) (rejecting the State\u2019s argument that the \u201cdistrict court\n\nwas not obligated to merge the two convictions because defendant committed\n\nmultiple assaults when he cut [the victim\u2019s] face, thumb, and arm\u201d since the \u201ccase\n\nwas presented to the jury as one continuous course of conduct\u201d). And the jury\n\n\n\n5 The State points out that photographs of the victim\u2019s injuries \u201cdepicted a swollen\n\nnose, an abrasion on her chin, [and] a lost tooth.\u201d\n\f                                          18\n\n\n\u201cwas never asked to do the fact-finding necessary to support two separate\n\nassaults.\u201d State v. Love, 858 N.W.2d 721, 725 (Iowa 2015). Instead, the State\n\ntried the case as \u201cone continuing event and submitted [it] to the jury in that manner.\u201d\n\nFolck, 325 N.W.2d at 376. As a result, we find the simple assault conviction must\n\nbe set aside.     See id.; see also State v. Newman, 326 N.W.2d 788, 793\n\n(Iowa 1982) (finding merger required where the \u201cprosecution from start to finish\n\nwas treated by all concerned as a single episode\u201d).\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       We find the body-cam video contained testimonial statements that violated\n\nRawlins\u2019s right to confrontation. And we conclude that Rawlins\u2019s conviction for\n\nsimple assault should have merged with his conviction for domestic abuse assault\n\ncausing bodily injury. For these reasons, we reverse Rawlins\u2019s convictions, vacate\n\nthe entry of judgment and sentence on those convictions, and remand for a new\n\ntrial on the charge of domestic abuse assault causing bodily injury only.\n\n       REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\f",
