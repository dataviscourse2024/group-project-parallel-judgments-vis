No. 1906006668\n\nMICHAEL RIVERA,\n\nDefendant.\n\nDate Decided: February 4, 2021\n\nUpon Defendant Michael Rivera\u2019s Motion to Suppress\nDENIED.\n\nORDER\n\nNicholas R. Wynn, Esquire, Deputy Attorney General, Wilmington, Delaware,\nAttorney for the State.\n\nMichael Rivera, pro se.\n\nSCOTT, J.\n\fOn this 4th day of February 2021, upon consideration of Defendant Michael\nRivera\u2019s (\u201cMr. Rivera\u201d) Motion to Suppress for Franks Violations, it appears to the\nCourt that:\n\n1. On June 11, 2019, New Castle County police arrested Mr. Rivera for an\nincident between Mr. Rivera and Ms. Laray Ross (\u201cMs. Ross\u201d) spanning\nbetween June 9-11, 2019.\n\n2, According to Detective Phillips\u2019 June 11, 2019 Report (the \u201cReport\u201d), Mr.\nRivera was initially accused of Kidnapping First Degree, Assault Second\nDegree, Unlawful Imprisonment First Degree, Terroristic Threatening,\nOffensive Touching, two counts of Strangulation, and Rape First Degree\nDuring the Commission or Attempted Commission of Specified\nMisdemeanors.\n\n3. However, Mr. Rivera was subsequently indicted for only Kidnapping First\nDegree, Assault Second Degree, Terroristic Threatening, and two counts of\nStrangulation.!\n\n4. Mr. Rivera has filed a Motion to Suppress and alleges that a Franks violation\n\nhas occurred.\n5. Mr. Rivera argues that the affidavit of probable cause supporting the\n\napplications for search warrants omits any mention that Ms. Ross informed\n\n \n\n' State\u2019s Resp. at p. 1.\n\fthe police that the sexual incident, which supports the Rape First Degree\ncharge, was consensual and that she was not sexually assaulted or abused. Mr.\nRivera argues that, since these statements were made before the police\nrequested any of the search warrants relevant to his case, Ridgeway v. State?\nmakes clear that any evidence resulting from these search warrants must be\nsuppressed.\u2019\n\n6. The case at hand involved what is more accurately described as a reverse-\nFranks situation. Namely, when omitted information is the basis of a\nchallenge to a warrant, the defendant must establish by the preponderance of\nthe evidence that the police knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless\ndisregard for the truth, omitted information material to a finding of probable\ncause.t Upon such a finding, \u201cthe reviewing court will add the omitted\ninformation to the affidavit and examine the affidavit with the newly added\ninformation to determine whether the affidavit still gives rise to probable\n\ncause.\u201d\n\n \n\n2 Ridgeway v. State, 2013 WL 2297078, at *3 (Del. 2013) (citing to Rivera v. State,\n7 A3d 961, 968 (Del. 2010) (\u201cIf the police omit facts from a search warrant\naffidavit that are material to a finding of probable cause with reckless disregard for\nthe truth, then the rationale of Franks v. Delaware applies, and the evidence\nobtained as a result of that search warrant must be suppressed.\u201d)).\n\n3 Def.\u2019s Mot. to Suppress at pp. 1-2.\n\n4 Rivera v. State, 7 A.3d 961, 968 (Del. 2010).\n\n3 Sisson vy. State, 903 A.2d 288, 300 (Del. 2006).\n\n2\n\f7. Mr. Rivera contends that the affidavit of probable cause omits any mention\nthat Ms. Ross informed the police that the sexual incident at issue was\nconsensual and that she was not sexually assaulted or abused.\n\n8. The affidavits of probable cause that accompanied the applications for all of\nthe search warrants stated the following:\n\nThe victim advised she then woke up and had sex with [Mr.\nRivera] but that she only consented to having sex with him\ndue to her being fearful of being assaulted further. The victim\ndid advise that she told Michael the sex hurt, and he stopped\nhaving sex with her.\u00b0\n\nIt should be noted that FNE Olicker advised Detective Phillips\nthat she asked the victim if she had been forced or coerced to\nhave sex and she stated she had not so a full SANE exam was\nnot conducted. Detective Phillips was made aware that FNE\nOlicker spoke with the victim again after Detective Phillips\nspoke to her and FNE Olicker advised that the victim then\nprovided her with a similar story that she did to Detective\nPhillips about the sexual intercourse.\u2019\n\n9. In the Report, Detective Phillips recorded the following:\n\n(1) \u201c[Ms. Ross] then clarified about the sexual intercourse\nthat she had with [Mr. Rivera]. [Ms. Ross] stated that [Mr.\nRivera] was trying to make up with her and she was trying\nto give him what he wanted so she wouldn\u2019t get harmed.\u201d; (2)\n\u201cIMs. Ross] did advise that if she didn\u2019t feel like she was atraid\nfor her life or that he was going to harm her again, then they\nwouldn\u2019t have had sex because she did not want to.\u201d; (3) \u201cIt\n\n \n\n\u00a9 The location of the statement changes for each warrant. For example, see\nparagraph 8 for the 2006 Mazda MPV search warrant. For the cell phone warrant,\nsee paragraph 15. (emphasis added).\n\n7 For the 2006 Mazda MPV search warrant, see paragraph 12. For the cell phone\nwarrant, see paragraph 20. (emphasis added).\n\fshould be noted that [Ms. Ross] did state that she did consent\nto having sex with [Mr. Rivera] and that he did not once\nsexually assault or abuse her\u201d;\u00ae (4) \u201cSANE nurse Olicker\nstated that a full SANE exam was not being conducted due to the\nvictim stating that she was never forced or coerced into having\nsex\u201d;? and (5) \u201cIt should be noted that I again made contact with\nSANE nurse Olicker about her second conversation with [Ms.\nRoss] and she advised that she asked [Ms. Ross] if she had ever\nagreed to have sex with [Mr. Rivera] in an effort to avoid a\nconflict or confrontation and [Ms. Ross] stated \u2018Yeah that\u2019s\nwhat happened today.\u2019\u201d!\u201d\n\n10. The police did not knowingly and intentionally or with a reckless disregard\n\nfor the truth, omit information from the search warrant affidavit that was\n\nmaterial to a finding of probable cause.\n11. Although the affidavit of support does not include specifically the statement\nthat Ms. Ross initially informed the police that she gave consent and was not\n\ncoerced into having sexual intercourse with Mr. Rivera, this initial statement\n\nis not material to the establishment of probable cause.\n12. Even if the Court were to add the omitted language to the affidavit, it would\n\nnot defeat a finding of probable cause in this Court\u2019s view:\n\nThe victim advised she then woke up and had sex with [Mr.\nRivera]. It should be noted that [Ms. Ross] did state that she\ndid consent to having sex with [Mr. Rivera] and that he did\nnot once sexually assault or abuse her; [however, she later\nclarified] that she only consented to having sex with him due to\nher being fearful of being assaulted further. The victim did advise\n\n \n\n8 Detective Phillips\u2019 June 11, 2020 Report, p. 6. (emphasis added).\n\n? Id. at p. 7.\n10 Fd.\n\fthat she told Michael the sex hurt, and he stopped having sex with\nher.\n\n13. It is this Court\u2019s opinion that the missing information or language is not\nmaterial to the establishment of probable cause, nor were the omissions made\nwith reckless disregard. At most, the omission by the police were negligent.\n\n14. Mr. Rivera has not shown, by \u201ca preponderance of the evidence, that the\npolice knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth,\nomitted information from the search warrant affidavit that was material to a\nfinding of probable cause.\u201d!!\n\n15. Moreover, at the hearing on this Motion, it appeared that Mr. Rivera\u2019s\nprimary argument, that the sexual intercourse with Ms. Ross was consensual,\nwas relevant to whether he should have been indicted for Rape First Degree\nand Unlawful Imprisonment in the first instance. It may not be apparent to\nMr. Rivera, but Mr. Rivera was not indicted for Rape First Degree and\nUnlawful Imprisonment.\n\nTherefore, for the reasons stated above, Mr. Rivera\u2019s Motion to Suppress is\nDENIED.\n\nIT ISSO ORDERED.\n\nLLL\n\nThe Honorable Calvin L. Scott, Jr.\n\n \n\n'! Rivera v. State, 7 A.3d 961, 968 (Del. 2010).\n\f",
