The juvenile court found Minor was at substantial risk\nof serious physical harm from Father\u2019s history of mental and\nemotional problems and Mother\u2019s willingness to permit Father to\nreside in the home and have unlimited access to Minor. Mother\nhas not appealed from the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction finding\nand disposition order, but Father asks us to decide whether\nsubstantial evidence supports both. He also argues the juvenile\ncourt erred in considering assertedly privileged statements made\nby hospital personnel during Father\u2019s involuntary psychiatric\nhospitalization, but, as we will explain, that is an issue we need\nnot resolve.\n\n                         I. BACKGROUND\n       A.    The Referral Regarding Father\u2019s Mental Health\n       On the evening of May 8, 2020, the Los Angeles County\nDepartment of Children and Family Services (the Department)\nresponded to a referral alleging general neglect of Minor, who\nwas seven years old at the time. According to the reporting\nparty, a man (later identified as Father) had been running in and\nout of the street, throwing water bottles at cars, and\nmasturbating in public.\n       A Department social worker arrived on the scene and\nobserved a man standing in the street waving and yelling at cars.\nThe social worker requested assistance from law enforcement\nbefore approaching Mother\u2019s duplex-style apartment. A\npsychiatric social worker from the Department of Mental Health\nwas also present on the scene when the police arrived. She found\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fFather\u2019s behavior to be \u201c\u2018bizarre, agitated, and paranoid\u2019\u201d and she\nobserved Father \u201cyelling at the officers with hopes of intimidating\nthem.\u201d When she tried to engage with Father, he was \u201cvery\ndelusional and . . . not making sense in his statements.\u201d\n       When the Department social worker, accompanied by police\nofficers, knocked on the door of the apartment where Minor and\nhis parents were living, Mother and Father refused to let them\nin. When the social worker explained (through the door) that she\nwanted to speak with Minor, Father brought Minor to a window\nand permitted the social worker to speak with him only through\nthe window. Minor told the social worker he felt safe, was not\nafraid of Mother or Father, and denied any verbal, physical, or\nsexual abuse. As far as the social worker could tell from the\nconversation through the window, Minor appeared calm and in\ngood health and good spirits.\n       Father, however, became increasingly hostile during the\nsocial worker\u2019s conversation with Minor and began directing\n\u201cracial slurs\u201d toward the social worker and the accompanying\nofficers. The social worker and the police officers, on the officers\u2019\nrecommendation, left the immediate area in an effort to avoid\nany further escalation in light of Father\u2019s mounting anger (he\nhad come outside the home and was yelling at them from the\nstreet when they were no longer near the apartment door).\n       The following day, May 9, 2020, another Department social\nworker and an accompanying police officer returned to the home\nand attempted to interview Mother and Father. They again\nrefused to open the door and Father became \u201cvery vulgar\u201d toward\nthe social worker and the accompanying officer. Father also\nissued a not-so-veiled threat, telling the social worker and the\npolice officer that if they tried \u201c\u2018to come in here, I have something\n\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fwaiting for you guys.\u2019\u201d The officer advised the social worker to\nmove away from the apartment\u2019s front door, and, after the officer\nconsulted with a police department supervisor, both left the area.\n      The assigned social worker continued to investigate Minor\u2019s\nwelfare by speaking to two neighboring tenants (otherwise\nunidentified by the Department\u2019s reporting) in Mother\u2019s\napartment building. Both neighbors stated they had heard\nyelling and profanity from the home of the family, and one of the\nneighbors reported hearing Mother hitting Minor on two\noccasions. Neither neighbor, however, reported seeing any\nbruises or unusual marks on Minor. The social worker also\nreported receiving \u201ccriminal docket\u201d information for Father that\nrevealed he underwent \u201cmental competency proceedings in\ncriminal [c]ourt in 2019[ ] in relation to a conviction for\nbattery/assault.\u201d1\n\n      B.    Father\u2019s Involuntary Hospitalization and Further\n            Department Investigation\n      Four days after the last visit by the police and the social\nworker to Mother and Father\u2019s home, i.e., on May 13, 2020, the\npolice had Father involuntarily hospitalized at Huntington\nHospital pursuant to section 5150 of the Welfare and Institutions\nCode. That statute permits taking a person into custody for up to\n72 hours for \u201cassessment, evaluation, and crisis intervention\u201d\nwhen there is probable cause the \u201cperson, as a result of a mental\n\n\n\n1\n      The Department was ultimately unable to obtain\ndocuments from the criminal case detailing the competency\nproceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                4\n\fhealth disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself, or\ngravely disabled.\u201d (Welf. & Inst. Code,2 \u00a7 5150, subd. (a).)\n       While Father was being held involuntarily, a Department\nsocial worker interviewed Mother. She acknowledged Father was\nyelling and \u201cbehaving awkwardly\u201d when police and a social\nworker first visited the family home on May 8th, but Mother\nexplained she did not open the door for law enforcement because\n\u201cshe did not want to hear [F]ather\u2019s mouth.\u201d As Mother put it,\n\u201c\u2018That was his issue and I did not want to be in it.\u2019\u201d Mother also\nexpressed more general frustrations with the police department\nbecause she said she previously contacted the police when\nFather\u2019s behavior was \u201cmanic\u201d and yet the police refused to help;\naccording to Mother, her last call to the police was about three\nweeks earlier when Father was screaming at her.3 Mother\nattributed Father\u2019s recent behavior to increased stress, but when\nasked if Father had mental health problems or took psychotropic\nmedication, Mother denied that he did.4 She also denied Father\n\n\n\n\n2\n     Undesignated statutory references that follow are to the\nWelfare and Institutions Code.\n3\n       According to police department records reviewed by the\nDepartment, Mother called law enforcement on April 4, 2020, and\nreported Father was screaming at her and she wanted him to\nleave.\n4\n      When asked about her plans when Father was discharged\nfrom the hospital, however, Mother said she would not allow him\nto return to the home if he does not take \u201chis medication.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fever physically assaulted her and she claimed she was not fearful\nof Father (though she did concede he \u201cverbally assaults\u201d her).5\n       The social worker also interviewed Minor (Mother was\npresent during the interview). When Minor was asked if he knew\nwhy the social worker wanted to talk to him, he said \u201c\u2018[Father]\nwas arrested, in my opinion he was arrested for no reason.\u2019\u201d\nAsked specifically about what occurred on May 8th (the day the\nDepartment first visited the family home), Minor said Father was\nupset and yelling but Minor did not know why. Minor also told\nthe interviewing social worker that Father yells at Mother often,\nbut Minor again said he did not know why. Minor denied being\nfearful of either parent, however, and he said he never saw\ndomestic violence between the two. He also denied being\nphysically disciplined by his parents and denied \u201call forms of\nabuse and neglect.\u201d\n       A Department social worker communicated with personnel\nat the hospital where Father was being held for evaluation (these\ncommunications would be the subject of Father\u2019s later claim of\nprivilege). The day after Father\u2019s admission, an employee of the\nhospital\u2019s \u201cpsych unit\u201d said Father had been behaving erratically\nand would yell when spoken to, but there was no diagnosis yet\nbecause he had not been seen by a psychiatrist. The following\nday, the hospital social worker overseeing Father\u2019s care informed\nthe Department that Father had been assessed by a \u201cDr.\nKurkjian\u201d and given a primary diagnosis of psychosis with a\nsecondary diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features.\nThe social worker said hospital personnel had offered medication\n\n\n5\n      In the social worker\u2019s judgment, Mother was \u201cvery\nprotective\u201d of Father and \u201cminimize[d]\u201d his behavior.\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fto Father, but he refused to take it. The hospital social worker\nfurther advised that Father\u2019s 72-hour involuntary hold could be\nextended if medical personnel found it necessary based on his\nprogress or lack thereof.6\n      Father was held for longer than the 72 hours permitted by\nsection 5150: he was discharged from the hospital on May 19,\n2020, i.e., six days after being admitted. Later that same day,\nthe Department obtained a warrant to remove Minor from his\nparents\u2019 custody. When the police and Department social\nworkers arrived at the family home to execute the removal\nwarrant, the parents initially refused access to Minor, but they\neventually relented\u2014though Father cursed and yelled profanities\nat the social workers and police officers.\n      Once removed from his parents\u2019 custody, Minor spoke with\na social worker and said he had felt safe with his parents. He\nrevealed, however, that Mother and Father often argued and\nMother would \u201ctape[ ] the holes in the apartment walls\u201d because\nshe believed there were cameras and microphones in the\napartment. In some contrast to his statement during a prior\ninterview in Mother\u2019s presence, Minor revealed his parents did\n\n\n6\n      After the 72-hour period authorized by section 5150, a\nperson may be certified for up to 14 additional days of intensive\ntreatment if the professional staff of a hospital or facility has\nanalyzed the person\u2019s condition and has found the person is, as a\nresult of a mental health disorder, a danger to himself or others,\nor gravely disabled, and the person is unwilling or unable to\naccept treatment on a voluntary basis. (\u00a7 5250; see generally In\nre Qawi (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1, 16 [describing a series of\nincreasingly lengthy periods of detention following an initial 72-\nhour commitment which are \u201c\u2018implemented incrementally\u2019\u201d].)\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fphysically discipline him on occasion but he said \u201cthey don\u2019t do it\na lot.\u201d Minor also stated he would view his time in foster care as\na \u201cvacation\u201d for his parents because he frequently made them\nmad. Minor did not elaborate.\n\n       C.    The Petition and Post-Detention Investigation\n       In May 2020, the Department filed a two-count dependency\npetition alleging Minor was at substantial risk of suffering\nserious physical harm as a result of his parents\u2019 failure or\ninability to adequately supervise or protect him. Count b-1 of the\npetition alleged Father had a history of mental and emotional\nproblems, including a diagnosis of Psychosis and Bi-Polar\nDisorder with psychotic features, that placed Minor at risk of\nharm and Mother \u201cknew of [Father\u2019s] mental and emotional\nproblems and failed to protect [Minor] in that [Mother] allowed\n[Father] to reside in [Minor\u2019s] home and to have unlimited access\nto [Minor].\u201d Count b-2 of the petition alleged Minor was at risk of\nharm from Father\u2019s abuse of marijuana and Mother\u2019s tolerance of\nthat abuse in Minor\u2019s presence.\n       At an initial detention hearing, Father denied the petition\u2019s\nallegations and objected to various statements in the\nDepartment\u2019s detention report, including the statements by\nhospital personnel discussing Father\u2019s mental health. The\njuvenile court ordered Minor detained from his parents and\npreserved Father\u2019s evidentiary objections for a jurisdiction\nhearing to be held later.\n       In advance of that hearing, the Department re-interviewed\nMother and Minor. Mother described Father as being a \u201cgood\nfather to [Minor]\u201d and denied being told by any doctor that\nFather had been diagnosed with any mental condition; she said\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\fshe only learned of a diagnosis of mental illness from the\nDepartment. In connection with the public masturbation that\nwas described by the original referring party, Mother said Father\nhad a hernia and needs to \u201cadjust himself quite frankly a lot.\u201d\nMother also told the Department that Father was no longer\nliving in her home and was staying instead at nearby motels.\n       In his follow-up interview, Minor told the Department\u2019s\ninvestigator that Father sometimes talks to himself. Minor also\ndescribed an instance when Father got \u201csuper duper mad\u201d at a\ndelivery driver and threw an object at the driver (Minor did not\nsee what the object was). In addition, Minor said he \u201ccan\u2019t\nexplain too much\u201d and believed the police came to his home\nbecause he was playing cops and robbers with his stuffed\nanimals.\n       The Department attempted repeatedly to interview Father\nbut ultimately the dependency investigator was able to\ncommunicate with him only through text messages. In several of\nhis text messages, Father accused the Department of\n\u201ckidnapping\u201d Minor, having a \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d engaging in\n\u201ccivil harassment,\u201d and being an \u201cindian god.\u201d One of the\nmessages complained of the Department\u2019s \u201cdefective incomplete\npaperwork, which has no legal seals\u201d and informed the\nDepartment that the paperwork had been \u201cforwarded to federal\nagency.\u201d\n       With its jurisdiction report to the juvenile court, the\nDepartment submitted a copy of the discharge papers from\nFather\u2019s involuntary hospitalization. While portions of the\ndischarge paperwork are legible, including the results of\nlaboratory tests and the directions regarding a medication that\nFather was taking (naproxen) before admission, other portions,\n\n\n\n\n                                9\n\fincluding the \u201cdischarge home medications,\u201d are almost entirely\nillegible. The section devoted to follow-up plans with Father\u2019s\nprimary care physician and other health care providers appear\nblank. The discharge papers, to the extent they are legible, do\nnot refer to Father\u2019s diagnosis or discuss Father\u2019s\ncommunications with his psychotherapist or his psychotherapist\u2019s\nadvice.\n       Prior to the adjudication hearing, Mother and Father filed\nwritten objections to various statements in the Department\u2019s\nreports. Mother\u2019s objection was general in nature.7 Father\nprincipally argued the medical records and statements made by\nor attributed to medical professionals charged with his care\nduring his section 5150 hold were protected by the\npsychotherapist-patient privilege and should be excluded. In\nopposition, the Department argued the psychotherapist-patient\nprivilege did not apply because Father was evaluated\ninvoluntarily pursuant to section 5150, which meant he was not a\n\u201cpatient\u201d within the meaning of the privilege. The Department\nalso argued the court had the authority to permit disclosure of\nFather\u2019s medical records under section 5328 because they were\nrelevant to investigation and prevention of child abuse and\nneglect.\n\n      D.    Adjudication and Disposition\n      The juvenile court held a jurisdiction and disposition\nhearing in July 2020. With regard to the parents\u2019 evidentiary\n\n\n7\n       During the later jurisdiction hearing, Mother\u2019s attorney\nclarified that her objection was to the hearsay statements of her\nneighbors found in the Department\u2019s detention report.\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\fobjections, the court ruled it would admit the statements of the\nunnamed witnesses (the reporting party and Mother\u2019s neighbors)\nbut accord them \u201clittle to no weight\u201d due to the absence of any\ncorroborating evidence. The court also ruled that it would not\ngive \u201cany weight\u201d to statements in the Department reports about\nFather\u2019s criminal history, including the aforementioned mental\ncompetency proceedings, because the Department did not provide\nthe court with certified copies of documents from the criminal\ncase. The juvenile court ruled the statements by hospital\npersonnel and the hospital discharge paperwork would be\nadmitted in evidence because section 5328 permitted the\ndisclosure of such information, including \u201cprivileged\ncommunication[s],\u201d and Father\u2019s right to confidentiality was\noutweighed by the need to investigate the risk to Minor\u2019s welfare.\n       The court otherwise admitted the Department\u2019s reports in\nevidence and also admitted exhibits offered by Mother, including\na certificate of outstanding engagement Minor received from his\nschool and a letter from his teacher. In her letter, the teacher\ndescribed Minor as a \u201cwonderful student who is very inquisitive\nand loves participating,\u201d \u201cgets along with all of the other\nstudents,\u201d and \u201cmake[s] even the shyest of kids feel comfortable.\u201d\n       After hearing argument, the juvenile court dismissed the\npetition\u2019s b-2 substance abuse count and sustained the b-1\nmental and emotional problems count after amendments by\ninterlineation. With its amendments, the court added language\nto indicate Father was hospitalized pursuant to a section 5150\nhold; struck language stating Father fondled his genitals in\npublic, threw water bottles at cars, and made delusional\nstatements; and limited language concerning Father\u2019s inability to\ncare for Minor so it referred to the existence of that inability only\n\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\f\u201cat times.\u201d8 Explaining its decision to sustain the b-1 count as\namended, the juvenile court stated: \u201c[A]fter reviewing all the\nevidence and hearing the arguments of counsel, I do believe that\nthe mental health condition and behaviors exhibited by [Father],\nand the impact it had on [Minor], does pose a physical risk to the\nchild.\u201d As for disposition, the juvenile court concurred with the\nposition advocated by the Department and Minor\u2019s attorney and\nordered Minor removed from his parents\u2019 custody and care.\n\n                          II. DISCUSSION\n       Mother does not appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s orders,\nwhich means our resolution of this appeal will not disturb the\njuvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over Minor. (In re I.A. (2011) 201\nCal.App.4th 1484, 1492; In re Alysha S. (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th\n393, 397.) Nevertheless, in light of the interrelated factual basis\nfor the finding of jurisdiction against both Mother and Father, we\nwill discuss the reasons why we believe the jurisdiction finding is\nsound even assuming the juvenile court should have granted\n\n8\n      As amended, count b-1 reads: \u201c[Father] has a history of\nmental and emotional problems, including a diagnosis of\nPsychosis and Bi-Polar Disorder with psychotic features which\nrenders [Father] at times unable to provide regular care of the\nchild. On 05/13/2020, [Father] was hospitalized on a 5150 hold\nfor the evaluation and treatment of [Father\u2019s] psychiatric\ncondition. [Mother] knew of [Father\u2019s] mental and emotional\nproblems and was unable to protect the child in that Mother\nallowed [Father] to reside in the child\u2019s home and to have\nunlimited access to the child. Such mental and emotional\ncondition on the part of [Father] and [Mother\u2019s] failure to protect\nthe child endanger the child\u2019s physical health and safety, and\nplaces the child at risk of serious physical harm . . . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                12\n\fFather\u2019s request to exclude the statements by hospital personnel\nand his hospital discharge paperwork.\n      In short, what truly matters is how mental and emotional\nproblems manifest, not any specific psychiatric diagnosis. Here,\nthere is strong evidence Father was suffering from mental and\nemotional problems that placed Minor at substantial risk of\nsuffering serious physical harm: the involuntary section 5150\npsychiatric hold, plus the extension of that hold beyond three\ndays by hospital staff; the observations of Father\u2019s erratic,\n\u201cdelusional,\u201d and threatening behavior by law enforcement and\nthe mental health social worker; and Mother and Minor\u2019s\nstatements about Father\u2019s aggressive and, at and least in one\ninstance, violent behavior at home. The strength of this evidence\ndispels any reasonable probability the juvenile court would have\ncome to a different conclusion absent consideration of the\nassertedly privileged information and provides ample grounds for\nthe assumption of jurisdiction. This same evidence, combined\nwith Mother\u2019s inability or unwillingness to take corrective\nmeasures, also establishes the requisite basis for the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s decision to remove Minor from his parents\u2019 custody.\n\n      A.     Reversal of the Jurisdiction Finding Is Unwarranted\n      Section 300, subdivision (b)(1) authorizes a juvenile court to\nassume dependency jurisdiction over a child when \u201c[t]he child has\nsuffered, or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,\nserious physical harm or illness, as a result of the failure or\ninability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise\nor protect the child . . . .\u201d Father argues the juvenile court\u2019s\njurisdiction finding is infirm because the court erred in admitting\nthe hospital personnel communications he contends are\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\fprivileged\u2014and even with those communications, there was\ninsufficient evidence to satisfy section 300, subdivision (b)(1).\nAssuming just for argument\u2019s sake that Father is right about the\nevidentiary error, the ruling was harmless in light of the relative\nstrength of the other un-objected-to evidence (see generally In re\nCeline R. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 45, 59-60; In re Jordan R. (2012) 205\nCal.App.4th 111, 134-135)\u2014and that, of course, means there is\nsubstantial evidence supporting the jurisdiction ruling (see\ngenerally In re R.T. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 622, 633).9\n       As Father himself recognizes in his opening brief, the mere\nfact a parent is diagnosed with a mental illness does not provide\nsufficient grounds to presume the parent\u2019s child is at risk of harm\nattributable to that illness. (See, e.g., In re A.L. (2017) 18\nCal.App.5th 1044, 1050 [\u201cthe law is settled that harm may not be\npresumed from the mere fact of a parent\u2019s mental illness\u201d].) That\nmeans, however, that the hospital social worker\u2019s disclosure of\nFather\u2019s diagnosis to the Department is not particularly\nprobative of whether Minor is a child described by section 300\nand the disclosure could not have played a prominent role in the\njuvenile court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction. The true question is\ninstead, as Father himself again puts it, \u201cwhether the parent\u2019s\nmental illness and resulting behavior adversely affects the\n[parent\u2019s] child or jeopardizes the child\u2019s safety. (Kimberly R. v.\nSuperior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1067, 1079.)\u201d There is good\nevidence, apart from the purportedly privileged communications\nfrom hospital personnel, that this is indeed the case.\n\n\n9\n      For analytical purposes, we also do not rely on evidence\nabout which the trial court stated it was giving little weight or no\nweight.\n\n\n\n\n                                 14\n\f       Father did not object to the juvenile court\u2019s consideration of\nthe fact of his involuntary hold at Huntington Hospital, nor could\nhe; that fact is not within the scope of the psychotherapist-\npatient privilege. The juvenile court amended the dependency\npetition to make explicit reference to that involuntary\nhospitalization and understandably so\u2014it speaks volumes under\nthe circumstances. As we have already described, Father could\nbe held at the hospital for 72 hours under section 5150 only if\nthere were probable cause to believe he was a danger to himself\nor others, or gravely disabled. Further, to extend such an\ninvoluntary hold beyond 72 hours under section 5250, the\nprofessional staff at the hospital must have confirmed\u2014after\nevaluation\u2014that Father, as a result of a mental health disorder,\nwas a danger to himself or others, or gravely disabled. Father\u2019s\ninvoluntary admission to the hospital is thus evidence that he\nwas suffering from a non-trivial mental illness at the time, and\npossibly an illness that posed a danger to himself or others.\n       Added to this evidence were the observations of those who\nsaw Father engaging in bizzare, delusional, and threatening\nbehavior before his involuntary hospitalization. The psychiatric\nsocial worker from the Department of Mental Health\ncharacterized Father\u2019s behavior as bizarre and paranoid, and she\nopined Father was yelling at police officers in a seeming attempt\nto intimidate them. In addition, when the psychiatric social\nworker attempted to engage with Father, he was \u201cvery delusional\nand . . . not making sense in his statements.\u201d The psychiatric\nsocial worker\u2019s assessment was consistent with the observations\na police officer on the scene who similarly characterized Father\u2019s\nbehavior as erratic and with the Department\u2019s social worker who\nsaw Father standing in the street yelling at cars. Moreover,\n\n\n\n\n                                 15\n\fwhen the Department\u2019s social worker and an accompanying\npolice officer later knocked on Father\u2019s door to check on Minor\u2019s\nwelfare, Father refused to open the door and said he had\n\u201csomething waiting for\u201d the officer and the social worker if they\ntried to enter. This threat was especially revealing for purposes\nof deciding whether jurisdiction over Minor was warranted:\nMinor (or another child) was present in the apartment at the\ntime, and Father\u2019s threat evidenced a willingness (bordering on\neagerness) to engage in a violent confrontation (perhaps with a\nweapon) in the presence of a child.\n       Added to all that were the statements made by Mother and\nMinor that suggested Father\u2019s aggression and instability were\ncommon in the family home and directed at least at Mother.\nMother acknowledged Father\u2019s \u201cmanic\u201d behavior toward her had\nbeen concerning enough that she called the police in the recent\npast, and Minor confirmed Father would yell at Mother often.\nMother attributed Father\u2019s \u201cawkward[ ]\u201d behavior to increased\nstress, and though she denied at one point that he took\npsychotropic medication, she at another point said she would not\nallow him back in the home unless he was taking his medication.\nMinor also revealed, without being willing to elaborate, that his\nparents physically disciplined him on occasion and stated he\nwould view his time in foster care as a \u201cvacation\u201d for his parents\nbecause he frequently made them mad. Minor acknowledged\nFather would talk to himself sometimes, and more significantly,\nMinor related the incident when Father became so angry with a\ndelivery driver that Father threw something at the driver.\n       With all of this evidence of mental and emotional problems\nthat manifested in bizarre actions, threats, screaming, calls to\nthe police, involuntary hospitalization, and at least in one\n\n\n\n\n                                16\n\finstance violent behavior, we see no reasonable probability the\ncourt would not have found jurisdiction if it had excluded the\nhospital\u2019s diagnosis of Father and his discharge paperwork.\nRather, there is strong evidence (that well exceeds the deferential\nsubstantial evidence threshold) that the court would have taken\njurisdiction rather than waiting for Father\u2019s mental and\nemotional condition to deteriorate to the point where Minor\nwould suffer serious physical harm. (In re I.J. (2013) 56 Cal.4th\n766, 773 [a juvenile court \u201c\u2018need not wait until a child is seriously\nabused or injured to assume jurisdiction and take the steps\nnecessary to protect the child\u2019\u201d]; accord, Jonathan L. v.

Substantial Evidence Supports the Removal Order\n       Under section 361, subdivision (c)(1), a dependent child\nmay not be removed from a parent unless the juvenile court finds\n\u201c[t]here is or would be a substantial danger to the physical\nhealth, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of\nthe minor if the minor were returned home, and there are no\nreasonable means by which the minor\u2019s physical health can be\nprotected without removing the minor from the minor\u2019s\nparent\u2019s . . . physical custody.\u201d (\u00a7 361, subd. (c)(1).) \u201c\u2018The parent\nneed not be dangerous and the minor need not have been actually\nharmed before removal is appropriate. The focus of the statute is\non averting harm to the child.\u2019 [Citation.] The court may\nconsider a parent\u2019s past conduct as well as present\ncircumstances.\u201d (In re N.M. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 159, 169-\n170.) We review a removal order for substantial evidence. (In re\n\n\n\n\n                                 17\n\fChristopher R. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1216; see also\nConservatorship of O.B. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 989, 1011.)\n        The juvenile court\u2019s decision to refrain from placing Minor\nwith either parent is supported by substantial evidence. As just\ndetailed, Father has unresolved mental and emotional problems\nthat raise the requisite substantial danger. Mother\u2019s conduct left\nno reason to believe she could or would do anything to mitigate\nthis danger. When directly asked whether Father suffered from\nany mental or emotional problems, Mother denied it and made\nexcuses for him. She also continued to have contact with Father\nand allowed him to have unlimited access to Minor even after\nprior calls to the police and witnessing his behavior with social\nworkers and police officers\u2014remarking at one point that Father\u2019s\nconfrontational, paranoid behavior was \u201c\u2018his issue and [she] did\nnot want to be in it.\u2019\u201d In other words, there was every reason to\nbelieve Mother would continue to have contact with Father and\nlittle if any reason to believe that she would protect Minor\u2019s\nphysical and emotional well-being without Department\nintervention and court-ordered services.\n\n\n\n\n                                18\n\f                          DISPOSITION\n      The juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction findings and disposition\norder are affirmed.\n\n\n    NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n\n\n\n                            BAKER, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n      RUBIN, P.
