COLLINS\n                                            OPINION BY\nv.   Record No. 110067          SENIOR JUSTICE HARRY L. CARRICO\n                                         January 13, 2012\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n                  FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA\n\n      In this appeal, we decide whether a bail bondsman licensed\n\nin another state but not in Virginia has the authority to enter\n\nVirginia and apprehend a fugitive bailee.   In a bench trial in\n\nthe Circuit Court of Mecklenburg County, the defendant, Clifton\n\nL. Collins, was convicted of attempted abduction pursuant to\n\nCode \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-26 and 18.2-47 and use of a firearm in the\n\ncommission of a felony pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.      The\n\ncircuit court sentenced Collins to incarceration for a term of\n\nfive years on the attempted abduction charge, all suspended, and\n\nto the mandatory term of three years' incarceration on the\n\nweapons charge.\n\n      Collins appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals of\n\nVirginia. In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed\n\nCollins\u2019 convictions.    Collins v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 355,\n\n702 S.E.2d 267 (2010).   We awarded Collins this appeal to\n\nconsider two assignments of error, as follows:\n\n      I.   The Court of Appeals erred as a matter of law in\n           affirming the trial court\u2019s finding that an out of\n           state licensed bail bondsman does not have legal\n           authority to recover a fugitive from Virginia or to\n\f           temporarily deprive a person of his freedom whom he\n           reasonably believes to be the fugitive.\n\n     II.   The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial\n           court\u2019s determination that Mr. Collins had the\n           requisite specific intent required for attempted\n           abduction when he, a lawfully licensed bondsman,\n           believed the person he was detaining to be the\n           fugitive and released the person immediately upon\n           learning that the person was not the fugitive.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n     Collins was licensed as a bail bondsman in North Carolina,\n\nbut not in Virginia.   On October 3, 2006, one of Collins\u2019 agents\n\nposted bond in the amount of $10,000 for the release of James R.\n\nSydnor, III, from custody in Wake County, North Carolina,\n\npending his trial on an identity theft charge.   Sydnor failed to\n\nappear in court on October 18, 2006, as required, and a motion\n\nwas made to forfeit the $10,000 bond.    The court issued a bond\n\nforfeiture notice stating that forfeiture would be set aside if\n\nthe fugitive was \u201csurrendered by a surety or bail agent to a\n\nsheriff of [North Carolina] as provided by law.\u201d\n\n     Collins learned that Sydnor would be in Virginia on March\n\n29, 2007, to attend a funeral at a church in Mecklenburg County.\n\nAccompanied by his wife, his son, and bail agents from his\n\noffice, Collins and his party drove in two vehicles to\n\nMecklenburg County intending to recover Sydnor and return him to\n\nNorth Carolina.   Collins had seen a \u201cmug shot\u201d of Sydnor but had\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fnever seen him in person before travelling to Mecklenburg\n\nCounty.\n\n       Upon arrival in Mecklenburg County, Collins arranged to\n\nmeet Steve Jones, a deputy sheriff of the county, in an effort\n\nto gain the sheriff department\u2019s assistance in apprehending\n\nSydnor.   Jones advised Collins that \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s office could\n\nnot get involved.\u201d\n\n       Collins then drove to the parking lot of the church where\n\nthe funeral service was just ending and saw a man he thought was\n\nSydnor opening the trunk of a car.    The man was not Sydnor but a\n\nDeputy Chief of Police (Deputy Chief) from a city in Virginia\n\nwho had come to the church to attend the funeral of his uncle.\n\nAt the conclusion of the service, he went to the parking lot to\n\nretrieve his checkbook from the trunk of his car to help his\n\nrelatives defray the cost of the funeral.\n\n       The Deputy Chief opened the trunk of his car and saw\n\nCollins approaching from a truck parked in a manner blocking his\n\ncar.   Collins got out of his truck with a Glock pistol in his\n\nhand, pointed it at the Deputy Chief, and said, \u201cI believe you\n\nsee what it is mother****, you know what it is.\u201d    Thinking he\n\nwas being robbed, the Deputy Chief said he did not have any\n\nmoney. Collins replied that \u201cthis ain\u2019t about money.\u201d    Collins\n\ngrabbed the Deputy Chief by the shoulder and began pulling him\n\ntoward the truck. The Deputy Chief was then confronted by\n\n                                  3\n\fCollins\u2019 employee, who emerged from the truck armed with mace\n\nand a handgun.   The Deputy Chief also observed a third person, a\n\nwoman, in the truck, but she took no part in the melee.\n\n     While pulling on the Deputy Chief to put him in the truck,\n\nCollins kept calling him \u201cJimmy\u201d and cursing at him. 1   The Deputy\n\nChief said: \u201cI\u2019m not Jimmy.   I\u2019m not getting in the truck.\u201d\n\nCollins asked the Deputy Chief for identification, and the\n\nDeputy Chief displayed his driver\u2019s license.    Collins told the\n\nDeputy Chief that he was a bondsman and that \u201cJimmy\u201d owed him\n\n$20,000.   He showed the Deputy Chief some sort of badge but\n\nrefused to give him any other identification.    Collins and his\n\nemployee then got in the truck and drove away.   The Deputy Chief\n\ncalled 911 and reported that someone had just pointed a gun at\n\nhim in the church parking lot.\n\n     A Mecklenburg County grand jury returned indictments\n\nagainst Collins for attempted abduction and use of a firearm in\n\nthe commission of attempted abduction.   At trial, Collins\n\nclaimed that he remained in his vehicle during his encounter\n\nwith the Deputy Chief, that he was alone in the vehicle, that he\n\ndid not have a firearm at the time of the episode, and that he\n\nhad not referred to the Deputy Chief as \u201cJimmy.\u201d   The trial\n\n\n\n     1\n       Sydnor's first name was \"James.\" He and the Deputy Chief\nwere cousins, and the Deputy Chief admitted at trial that they\nslightly resembled each other.\n                                 4\n\fjudge told Collins to his face that he found his testimony\n\n\"unbelievable.\"\n\n                             ANALYSIS\n\n                        Attempted Abduction\n\n     Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A), pursuant to which Collins was convicted\n\nof attempted abduction, provides as follows:\n\n     Any person who, by force, intimidation or deception, and\n     without legal justification or excuse, seizes, takes,\n     transports, detains or secretes another person with the\n     intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty\n     or to withhold or conceal him from any person, authority or\n     institution lawfully entitled to his charge, shall be\n     deemed guilty of \"abduction.\"\n\n     Collins argues that, as a bail bondsman licensed in North\n\nCarolina, he had a common law right with wide reaching arrest\n\nauthority allowing him to enter another state for the purpose of\n\napprehending a fugitive, even though he is not licensed in the\n\nother state.   This authority, Collins maintains, gave him the\n\n\u201clegal justification or excuse,\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-47, for\n\nthe seizure of a fugitive bailee.\n\n     We will assume, without deciding, that the common law\n\npreviously authorized an out-of-state bondsman to enter this\n\nCommonwealth and apprehend a fugitive bailee without becoming\n\nlicensed in Virginia.   We must determine, therefore, whether\n\nanything has occurred to change the common law rule.   Since \u201ca\n\ndecision to abrogate [a] longstanding common law principle is\n\nthe proper function of the legislature, not the courts,\u201d\n\n                                 5\n\fRobinson v. Matt Mary Moran, Inc., 259 Va. 412, 417-18, 525\n\nS.E.2d 559, 562 (2000), we will confine our search to\n\nlegislative changes.    And because we must interpret and apply\n\nany statutory changes, we are presented with a pure question of\n\nlaw, which we will review de novo.    Gilliam v. McGrady, 279 Va.\n\n703, 708, 691 S.E.2d 797, 799 (2010).    Established principles of\n\nlaw will guide us in that review.\n\n     Code \u00a7 1-200 provides as follows:\n\n          The common law of England, insofar as it is not\n     repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and\n     Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full\n     force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except\n     as altered by the General Assembly.\n\n     In Herndon v. St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, 266 Va. 472, 476, 587\n\nS.E.2d 567, 569 (2003), we stated as follows:\n\n     [A] statutory provision will not be held to change the\n     common law unless the legislative intent to do so is\n     plainly manifested. Therefore, a statutory change in the\n     common law will be recognized only in that which is\n     expressly stated in the words of the statute or is\n     necessarily implied by its language.\n\n(Citations omitted).\n\n     At its 2002 session, the General Assembly adopted House\n\nJoint Resolution No. 201, which decried the lack of statewide\n\nstandards and procedures for the certification and regulation of\n\nbail bondsmen. 2   The resolution directed the Virginia State Crime\n\nCommission \"to study certain issues pertaining to bail bondsmen\n\n     2\n       Previously, circuit courts and the State Corporation\nCommission authorized persons to act as bail bondsmen.\n                                  6\n\f[and] bounty hunters\" and to \"complete its work by November 30,\n\n2002,\" in time for submission to the 2003 session of the General\n\nAssembly.\n\n     In its final report, the State Crime Commission made twenty\n\nrecommendations concerning bail bondsmen and twenty for bounty\n\nhunters.    See Virginia State Crime Comm'n, Report on Study of\n\nBail Bondsmen & Bounty Hunters, House Doc. No. 13, at 18-23\n\n(2004).    In response, the General Assembly adopted Chapter 460\n\nof the Acts of Assembly of 2004, which created Article 11 of\n\nChapter 1, Title 9.1 of the Code of Virginia, relating to bail\n\nbondsmen, comprised of Sections 9.1-185 to 9.1-185.18 at the\n\ntime of Collins' journey into Virginia, and Article 12, relating\n\nto bail enforcement agents, comprised of Sections 9.1-186 to\n\n9.1-186.13.\n\n     Code \u00a7 9.1-185.2 gave the Criminal Justice Services Board\n\n(the Board) full regulatory authority and oversight of property\n\nand surety bail bondsmen and Code \u00a7 9.1-186.2 gave the Board the\n\nsame authority and oversight of bail enforcement agents, or\n\n\"bounty hunters.\"\n\n     With respect to both groups, the Board is required to adopt\n\nregulations that are \"necessary to ensure respectable,\n\nresponsible, safe and effective bail bonding [and bail\n\nenforcement] within the Commonwealth.\"   Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-185.2 and\n\n9.1-186.2(C).   Detailed provisions are specified for licensure,\n\n                                  7\n\fprofessional conduct, discipline, solicitation of business,\n\ntraining in and use of firearms, types of clothing and\n\nidentification, documentation and record keeping, recovery of\n\nbailees, and penalties for certain persons who violate any\n\nstatute or Board regulation.\n\n     Collins argues that none of these statutory changes\n\n\u201cspecifically take away the right of an out of state bondsman\n\n[to apprehend] his bailee in Virginia.\u201d   We disagree with\n\nCollins.\n\n     Code \u00a7 9.1-185 defines a bondsman as \"any person who is\n\nlicensed by the Department [of Criminal Justice Services] who\n\nengages in the business of bail bonding and is thereby\n\nauthorized to conduct business in all courts of the\n\nCommonwealth.\"   Code \u00a7 9.1-186 defines a bail enforcement agent\n\nor \u201cbounty hunter\u201d as \"any individual engaged in bail recovery.\"\n\nCode \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-185.18 and 9.1-186.13 provide that any individual\n\nwho, without a valid license issued by the Department of\n\nCriminal Justice Services, engages in bail bonding or bail\n\nrecovery in the Commonwealth is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n\nAnd Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-185.7(A) and 9.1-186.7(A), styled \u201cLicensure of\n\nnonresidents,\u201d provide that all nonresident transfers and\n\napplicants for a bail bondsman license or a bail enforcement\n\nagent license shall satisfy all licensing requirements for\n\nresidents of the Commonwealth.\n\n                                 8\n\f     We cannot perceive how the General Assembly could have more\n\nplainly manifested its intent to abrogate the long standing\n\ncommon law rule allowing out-of-state bail bondsmen and bounty\n\nhunters to enter Virginia to apprehend fugitive bailees.    It is\n\ninconceivable that the General Assembly intended to impose such\n\nstrict requirements upon in-state bail bondsmen and bounty\n\nhunters as those enacted as a result of the Crime Commission\n\nreport, yet intended to leave out-of-staters with the unfettered\n\nright to enter Virginia and apprehend fugitive bailees without\n\nbeing subject to regulation.   Such an intent would be completely\n\nat odds with the legislatively expressed goal of ensuring\n\n\u201crespectable, responsible, safe and effective bail bonding [and\n\nbond enforcement] within the Commonwealth.\u201d   Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-185.2\n\nand 9.1-186.2(C).   We will not attribute such an intent to the\n\nGeneral Assembly and instead will hold that it plainly\n\nmanifested its intent to abrogate the common law rule.\n\n                       Requisite Specific Intent\n\n     Collins argues that he reasonably believed it was Sydnor he\n\nattempted to load into his truck and only a mistake of fact\n\ncaused him to attempt to capture and transport the Deputy Chief.\n\nThere was not sufficient evidence, Collins maintains, to\n\nestablish the specific intent, or to prove the mens rea,\n\nnecessary to support a conviction of attempted abduction.\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\f     At this point, however, Collins\u2019 mistake of fact is\n\nirrelevant. 3   Without the common law rule to protect him, he had\n\nno privilege to use force to detain anyone, including Sydnor,\n\nhad he been on the scene instead of the Deputy Chief.    Moreover,\n\na person's intent may be proven by his actions.    Hughes v.\n\nCommonwealth, 18 Va. App. 510, 519, 446 S.E.2d 451, 457 (1994).\n\nThe evidence of Collins' use of foul language, his pointing of a\n\ndeadly weapon at the Deputy Chief, his allowance of an employee\n\nto confront the Deputy Chief with mace and a handgun, and his\n\nuse of physical force in pulling the Deputy Chief toward the\n\ntruck all prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, \u201cwithout legal\n\njustification or excuse, [he] seize[d] . . . another person with\n\nthe intent to deprive such other person of his personal\n\nliberty.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-47.\n\n     In a final argument, Collins contends that he abandoned any\n\nintent to abduct as soon as he learned it was the Deputy Chief\n\nand not Sydnor he was pulling on to get him into the truck and\n\nthat this supports his argument concerning the lack of specific\n\nintent.   But the abandonment came too late.   At that point, the\n\nattempt was complete.    \u201c[I]f a man resolves on a criminal\n\nenterprise, and proceeds so far in it that his act amounts to an\n\n     3\n       We have expressly declined to adopt a \" 'hybrid legal\nimpossibility' \" defense in which \"a mistake of fact about the\nlegal status of some necessary element of [a] crime nullifies a\ncrime of attempt.\" Hix v. Commonwealth, 270 Va. 335, 342 n.5,\n619 S.E.2d 80, 84 n.5 (2005).\n                                 10\n\findictable attempt, it does not cease to be such, though he\n\nvoluntarily abandons the evil purpose.\u201d   Howard v. Commonwealth,\n\n207 Va. 222, 229, 148 S.E.2d 800, 805 (1966) (quoting Glover v.\n\nCommonwealth, 86 Va. 382, 386, 10 S.E. 420, 422 (1889)).\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n     For the reasons assigned, we will affirm the judgment of\n\nthe Court of Appeals of Virginia.\n\n                                                           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               11\n\f",
