PDA assigned her to represent \u201cMr. Smith\u201d1 on a charge of felony stalking.\n\nDuring the representation, Smith began making frequent, unwanted, and inappropriate phone\n\ncalls to LaRose at work. LaRose notified her supervisors, but she decided to continue to\n\nrepresent Smith and her supervisors did not remove her from the case. After the representation\n\nended, Smith\u2019s harassing and stalking behavior escalated until he was arrested and charged for\n\nhis conduct. LaRose subsequently was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\n\nwas placed on disability, and ultimately was discharged from employment because she was\n\nunable to work as a public defender.\n\n\n1\n  Because the details of LaRose\u2019s representation of her client are privileged, the parties refer to\nthe man who stalked LaRose as \u201cClient A\u201d or \u201cMr. Smith.\u201d This opinion refers to the client as\nSmith.\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       LaRose filed a lawsuit against PDA and the County, alleging among other claims that her\n\nsupervisors\u2019 handling of the situation with Smith had created a hostile work environment in\n\nviolation of the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW, that\n\nPDA and the County were negligent in failing to protect her from Smith\u2019s harassment, that PDA\n\nand the County deliberately injured her, and that the County discriminated against her based on\n\nher disability. The trial court dismissed the hostile work environment claim under CR 12(b)(6)\n\nand granted summary judgment in favor of PDA and the County on LaRose\u2019s remaining claims.\n\nLaRose appeals those rulings.\n\n       Before dismissing LaRose\u2019s claims, the trial court ruled on summary judgment that the\n\nCounty was vicariously liable for PDA\u2019s conduct. The County cross-appeals that ruling.\n\n       We hold that (1) the trial court erred in dismissing LaRose\u2019s WLAD claim because under\n\ncertain circumstances, an employer may be subject to liability for a hostile work environment\n\nclaim based on a nonemployee\u2019s harassment of an employee in the workplace; (2) the trial court\n\nerred in ruling that the Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), title 51 RCW, bars LaRose\u2019s negligence\n\nclaims because a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether her PTSD and related injuries\n\nconstituted a compensable \u201cinjury\u201d under the IIA; (3) LaRose did not present evidence that\n\ncreated a genuine issue of material fact that the IIA bar is inapplicable under RCW 51.24.020\n\nbased on her allegation that PDA and the County deliberately injured her; and (4) LaRose\u2019s\n\ndisability discrimination claim fails because she did not present evidence that created a genuine\n\nissue of material fact regarding that claim. In addition, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling\n\nthat the County is vicariously liable for PDA\u2019s conduct.\n\n       Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order dismissing LaRose\u2019s hostile work\n\nenvironment claims and negligence claims, but we affirm the trial court\u2019s order dismissing\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nLaRose\u2019s disability discrimination claim. And we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that the County\n\nis vicariously liable for PDA\u2019s conduct. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n                                             FACTS\n\n       PDA operated as The Defender Association (TDA) and served as a contracted non-profit\n\npublic defense law firm for the County from 1969 to June 30, 2013.2 In July 2013, the County\n\nended its contract with PDA and began directly administering the public defense program. Most\n\nPDA employees, including LaRose, became County employees effective July 1, 2013.\n\n       LaRose was employed by PDA as an attorney public defender beginning in 2009. She\n\nbegan her first rotation in the felony division in July 2012. While at PDA, LaRose did not\n\nreceive any training, policies, or procedures for responding to sexual harassment or threats of\n\nviolence from clients.\n\nPrior Smith Incident\n\n       In June 2012, PDA public defender Rebecca Lederer was representing Smith on a felony\n\nstalking charge. Smith left Lederer a voicemail in which he repeatedly said that he loved her.\n\nLederer asked her supervisor, Daron Morris, for permission to withdraw from Smith\u2019s case and\n\nfor the case to be reassigned because she felt uncomfortable representing Smith. Morris\n\nrecommended that the case be reassigned to another attorney because there was a good reason to\n\nbelieve that Smith would have trouble maintaining the proper professional boundary with his\n\nattorney if Lederer continued to represent him.\n\n       Lederer chose to withdraw and suggested that Smith be reassigned to a male attorney.\n\nMorris transferred the case to a male attorney.\n\n\n2\n The organization changed its name from TDA to PDA when its contract with the County ended.\nBecause PDA is the named party in this action, we refer to PDA rather than TDA.\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nSmith\u2019s Harassment of LaRose\n\n       On October 31, 2012, LaRose was assigned to represent Smith on a new charge of felony\n\nstalking. LaRose was not given any information about Smith\u2019s history of stalking professional\n\nwomen or his interaction with Lederer and was not warned of any potential danger in\n\nrepresenting him.\n\n       In late March 2013, during LaRose\u2019s representation, Smith began to make repeated\n\nsexually motivated, harassing phone calls to LaRose at work. Smith told LaRose that he loved\n\nher, wanted to marry her, and wanted to be with her. By April, Smith was calling LaRose 10 to\n\n20 times a day and making more disturbing sexual and offensive comments.\n\n       In April, LaRose met with her supervisor, Ben Goldsmith, and described Smith\u2019s\n\nharassing calls. She expressed her concerns about the calls and the fact that Smith would not\n\nstop calling despite her demand that he do so. LaRose stated that she thought she needed to get\n\noff the case. Goldsmith \u201csaid \u2018Okay,\u2019 in an irritated, dismissive, angry, impatient tone.\u201d Clerk\u2019s\n\nPapers (CP) at 177. A few days later after giving the matter some thought, LaRose told\n\nGoldsmith that she would try to finish the case because she was almost done with the\n\nrepresentation. Goldsmith again said \u201cOkay.\u201d CP at 179.\n\n       After that initial conversation, LaRose repeatedly went to Goldsmith and told him that the\n\ncalls were continuing and getting worse and that she was concerned and worried about them.\n\nBut she did not request that she should be taken off the case. And neither Goldsmith nor anyone\n\nelse offered to reassign the case to another attorney.\n\n       In May, Smith\u2019s calls were continuing at the same rate. LaRose also received a\n\nhandwritten letter from Smith with intrusive and sexually motivated content that frightened her.\n\nOn May 24, LaRose met with Goldsmith and Leo Hamaji, another supervisor, to discuss the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nletter and Smith\u2019s obsessive and offensive communications with her. Goldsmith and Hamaji did\n\nnot remove LaRose from the case, relieve her from the obligation to be in frequent contact with\n\nSmith, or take steps to stop Smith from contacting her. LaRose also did not ask to be removed\n\nfrom the case.\n\n       On June 4, LaRose met again with Hamaji about the unwanted harassing phone calls.\n\nShe described the nature of the calls, told him that they were becoming more inappropriate, and\n\nstated that she was having trouble sleeping. Hamaji told LaRose to ignore the calls. The\n\nconstant offensive calls continued through June.\n\n       In July 2013, LaRose sought permission from the superior court to withdraw from\n\nrepresentation of Smith pursuant to PDA policy when Smith requested a motion to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea. LaRose was allowed to withdraw on July 26. By the end of July, Smith\u2019s calls were\n\ncontinuing and escalating. LaRose went to Goldsmith at least three times and informed him that\n\nthe calls were continuing. Twice he said nothing, and the third time he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 call\n\nthe cops.\u201d\n\n       Smith continued to make offensive calls and comments after LaRose\u2019s representation\n\nended. He pursued contact with LaRose inside and outside the office. Smith was released from\n\ncustody in November 2013 and began following and making contact with LaRose in public. And\n\nthe incessant calls continued. LaRose let Hamaji know that the unwanted sexual calls at work\n\nhad not stopped.\n\n       LaRose estimated that she received over 1,000 calls from Smith between March 2013 and\n\nFebruary 2014.\n\n       In February 2014, Smith jumped out at LaRose in the parking garage, left lingerie on her\n\ncar, left literature in her mailbox, and came repeatedly to her house. He hid in her backyard,\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nappeared at her bedroom window in the middle of the night, and broke a bedroom window. He\n\nsent messages about seeing LaRose, her daughter, and a man who came to her home. LaRose\n\nsent emails to her County supervisors detailing these contacts.\n\n       Smith finally was arrested on February 21 and was charged with felony stalking.\n\nLaRose testified as the complaining witness at his trial. Smith was tried and convicted in\n\nJanuary 2015 and was sentenced to seven years in confinement.\n\n       LaRose experienced a high level of stress and anxiety due to Smith\u2019s stalking behavior.\n\nShe ultimately was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and\n\nPTSD. She was first diagnosed with PTSD in March 2015. LaRose requested medical leave in\n\n2015 because her work continued to provoke stress and anxiety. The County granted her\n\nrequest. The County eventually terminated LaRose in 2017 when she was unable to continue\n\nworking as a public defender.\n\nLaRose Lawsuit and Dismissal of Claims\n\n       LaRose filed a lawsuit against PDA and the County, claiming that they had violated the\n\nWLAD by failing to provide a non-hostile work environment free of harassment and engaging in\n\nother discriminatory conduct. The County and PDA both filed motions to dismiss under CR\n\n12(b)(6), arguing that they could not be liable as a matter of law for Smith\u2019s harassing conduct.\n\nThe trial court granted the motions and dismissed LaRose\u2019s claim with prejudice.\n\n       LaRose subsequently filed an amended complaint, asserting claims for a violation of the\n\nspecial relationship duty to provide a safe workplace for employees, negligent infliction of\n\nemotional distress, disability discrimination, and a number of other claims in addition to a hostile\n\nwork environment claim. PDA filed a motion to dismiss, arguing among other things that the\n\nWLAD claims already had been dismissed, the negligence claims were barred by the IIA, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nthere could be no disability discrimination claim against PDA because LaRose had no disability\n\nwhile she was employed by PDA. The trial court dismissed the hostile work environment and\n\ndisability discrimination claims against PDA, but it denied the motion with regard to the\n\nnegligence claims.\n\n       The County and PDA later filed summary judgment motions with regard to LaRose\u2019s\n\nremaining claims, arguing that the IIA barred the negligence claims.   They claimed that the IIA\n\nbar applied because LaRose\u2019s PTSD and other mental conditions were caused by individual\n\ntraumatic events and therefore constituted an industrial injury that was compensable under the\n\nIIA. They submitted the deposition testimony of Dr. Stanley Shyn, LaRose\u2019s treating\n\npsychologist, who testified that certain conduct of Smith constituted traumatic events that were\n\nsufficient to support her PTSD diagnosis. The County also argued that summary judgment was\n\nappropriate on LaRose\u2019s disability discrimination claim against the County.\n\n       In opposition, LaRose argued that her injury was not an occupational injury compensable\n\nunder the IIA. She presented declarations from Dr. Shyn, and a physician, Dr. Lawrence Wilson,\n\nwho stated that her PTSD was caused by the cumulative effect of being stalked by Smith rather\n\nthan any single event. LaRose also argued that the IIA did not bar her claims under RCW\n\n51.24.020 because PDA and the County knew that her injury was certain to occur. Finally,\n\nLaRose argued that sufficient evidence supported her disability discrimination claim.\n\n       The trial court granted the summary judgment motions and dismissed LaRose\u2019s\n\nremaining claims.\n\n       The County also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of vicarious\n\nliability. The trial court denied the County\u2019s motion and ruled as a matter of law that the County\n\nwas vicariously liable for the actions of PDA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       LaRose appeals the trial court\u2019s orders dismissing her hostile work environment,\n\nnegligence, and disability discrimination claims. The County cross-appeals the trial court\u2019s\n\nruling that the County is vicariously liable for PDA\u2019s conduct.\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\nA.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss under CR 12(b)(6) de novo.\n\nWash. Trucking Ass\u2019n v. Emp\u2019t Sec. Dep\u2019t, 188 Wash. 2d 198, 207, 393 P.3d 761, cert. denied 138\n\nS. Ct. 261 (2017). Dismissal is appropriate when it appears beyond doubt that a plaintiff will be\n\nunable to prove any set of facts that would justify recovery. Id. When ruling on a motion to\n\ndismiss, the trial court generally may consider only the allegations contained in the complaint\n\nand may not look beyond the face of the pleadings. Jackson v. Quality Loan Serv. Corp. of\n\nWash., 186 Wash. App. 838, 844, 347 P.3d 487 (2015).\n\n       If a court hearing a motion to dismiss considers matters outside of the pleadings, the\n\nmotion must be treated as a summary judgment motion. McNamara v. Koehler, 5 Wash. App. 2d\n\n708, 713, 429 P.3d 6 (2018), rev. denied, 192 Wash. 2d 1021 (2019). Here, the trial court stated in\n\nits order granting the County\u2019s and PDA\u2019s CR 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss that it had considered\n\nnumerous declarations in addition to the pleadings. Therefore, we review the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision on the motions to dismiss as a summary judgment decision.\n\n       We review a trial court\u2019s summary judgment order de novo. Zonnebloem, LLC v. Blue\n\nBay Holdings, LLC, 200 Wash. App. 178, 182, 401 P.3d 468 (2017). We view all facts and\n\nreasonable inferences drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n\nId. Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. A genuine issue of material fact\n\nexists if reasonable minds could disagree on the conclusion of a factual issue. Id. at 183.\n\n        The moving party bears the initial burden of proving that there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact. Id. Once a moving defendant shows that there is an absence of evidence to\n\nsupport the plaintiff\u2019s case, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to present specific facts that rebut the\n\ndefendant\u2019s contentions and show a genuine issue of material fact. Id.\n\nB.      HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT CLAIM\n\n        LaRose argues that the trial court erred by ruling as a matter of law that PDA and the\n\nCounty could not be liable under the WLAD for the harassing behavior of a nonemployee. She\n\nargues that the County and PDA were directly liable for the hostile work environment because\n\nPDA and the County knew about the harassment and failed to take adequate corrective action.\n\nWe agree that under the circumstances here, PDA and the County may be subject to liability on a\n\nhostile work environment claim based on harassment of their employee LaRose by a\n\nnonemployee.\n\n        1.   Legal Principles\n\n        The WLAD states that \u201cpractices of discrimination against any [Washington] inhabitants\n\n. . . are a matter of state concern\u201d and that \u201csuch discrimination threatens not only the rights and\n\nproper privileges of [Washington] inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a\n\nfree democratic state.\u201d RCW 49.60.010. In addition, RCW 49.60.030 states that the right to be\n\nfree from discrimination is a \u201ccivil right,\u201d which includes the right to hold employment without\n\ndiscrimination. And RCW 49.60.020 states, \u201cThe provisions of this chapter shall be construed\n\nliberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n          RCW 49.60.180(3) establishes that it is an unfair practice for an employer \u201c[t]o\n\ndiscriminate against any person in compensation or in other terms or conditions of employment\n\nbecause of . . . sex.\u201d Under RCW 49.60.030(2), a person discriminated against in violation of the\n\nWLAD may bring a civil action.\n\n          One form of a sex discrimination claim is a hostile work environment claim. Antonius v.\n\nKing County, 153 Wash. 2d 256, 261, 103 P.3d 729 (2004). To establish a prima facie claim of a\n\nhostile work environment the plaintiff must show that \u201c(1) the harassment was unwelcome, (2)\n\nthe harassment was because of sex, (3) the harassment affected the terms and conditions of\n\nemployment, and (4) the harassment is imputable to the employer.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court first\n\nadopted this test in Glasgow v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 103 Wash. 2d 401, 406-07, 693 P.2d 708\n\n(1985).\n\n          Regarding the fourth element of the Glasgow test, harassment will be imputed to the\n\nemployer if \u201can owner, manager, partner or corporate officer personally participates.\u201d Id. at 407.\n\nAn employer will be responsible for harassment by the plaintiff\u2019s supervisors or coworkers if the\n\nemployer \u201c(a) authorized, knew, or should have known of the harassment and (b) failed to take\n\nreasonably prompt and adequate corrective action.\u201d Id. A plaintiff can establish knowledge and\n\nfailure to take adequate corrective action by showing\n\n          (a) that complaints were made to the employer through higher managerial or\n          supervisory personnel or by proving such a pervasiveness of sexual harassment at\n          the workplace as to create an inference of the employer\u2019s knowledge or constructive\n          knowledge of it and (b) that the employer\u2019s remedial action was not of such nature\n          as to have been reasonably calculated to end the harassment.\n\nId.\n\n          2.   Liability for Nonemployee Harassment\n\n          Glasgow stated the rules for imputing harassment to the employer when a person\n\ninvolved with the employer\u2019s ownership or management or another employee harasses the\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nplaintiff. Id. The issue here is whether a nonemployee\u2019s harassment of the plaintiff can be\n\nimputed to an employer when the employer knew of the harassment and failed to take adequate\n\ncorrective action. Even though PDA and the County argue otherwise, this issue is one of first\n\nimpression in Washington.\n\n       LaRose argues that the same standard of employer liability should apply regardless of\n\nwhether the person engaging in the harassment is an employee or a nonemployee: whether the\n\nemployer knew about the harassment and failed to take adequate protective action. See Glasgow,\n\n103 Wash. 2d at 407. PDA and the County argue that DeWater v. State, 130 Wash. 2d 128, 921 P.2d\n\n1059 (1996), established that an employer can be liable for harassment by only an employee.\n\n             a.   DeWater\n\n       In DeWater, the State licensed a foster parent to operate a group foster home. 130 Wash. 2d\n\nat 130-31. The foster parent hired the plaintiff to assist in the group home. Id. at 131. The\n\nfoster parent supervised the plaintiff and had sole authority to direct her work and terminate her,\n\nbut the State paid the plaintiff\u2019s wages. Id. The plaintiff alleged that the foster parent subjected\n\nher to sexual harassment while she worked in the group home, and she filed a sexual harassment\n\nlawsuit against the State as her employer. Id. at 132-33.\n\n       The court summarized the standards of an employer\u2019s liability for a hostile work\n\nenvironment as set forth in Glasgow. DeWater, 130 Wash. 2d at 135. The court noted that the\n\nfourth element was the only issue on appeal: whether the foster parent\u2019s harassment could be\n\nimputed to the State. Id. The court stated that where the harasser was not in management, \u201cthe\n\nemployer is not held vicariously liable unless the plaintiff shows that the person committing the\n\nharassment is an employee\u201d and the employer has knowledge and fails to take corrective action.\n\nId. (emphasis added). PDA and the County focus on this language.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       However, the court in DeWater repeatedly stated that the only issue on appeal was\n\nwhether the State was \u201cvicariously liable\u201d for the foster parent\u2019s actions. Id. at 130, 133-34. The\n\ncourt explained that the State may be held vicariously liable if the foster parent was an employee,\n\nbut not if the foster parent was an independent contractor unless the State had the right to control\n\nthe manner in which the foster home as operated. Id. at 137. The court concluded that the foster\n\nparent was an independent contractor, not an employee, and that the State did not control the\n\nmanner and means of operating the foster home. Id. at 137-41. Therefore, the court held that the\n\nState was not vicariously liable for the foster parent\u2019s actions. Id. at 141.\n\n       DeWater did not directly address the issue presented here: whether an employer is subject\n\nto liability for harassment in the workplace by a nonemployee. The court held that an employer\n\ncould be \u201cvicariously liable\u201d only for the actions of an employee. Id. at 135. And the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized DeWater as a vicarious liability case. See Aba Sheikh v. Choe, 156 Wash. 2d\n\n441, 456-57, 128 P.3d 574 (2006). But LaRose does not argue that PDA and the County are\n\nvicariously liable for Smith\u2019s harassment. She argues that they are directly liable for failing to\n\ntake corrective action once they learned of Smith\u2019s harassment.\n\n       The court in DeWater did not consider whether the harassment could be imputed to the\n\nState if the State had known about the foster parent\u2019s harassment and had failed to take\n\ncorrective action. The plaintiff in that case argued that \u201cthe State knew or should have known of\n\nthe hostile work environment because it had notice of an inappropriate sexual comment made to\n\na caseworker at [the foster parent\u2019s] previous place of employment.\u201d Id. at 136. But the court\n\ndid not discuss this allegation or whether knowledge of an independent contractor\u2019s harassment\n\ncould subject an employer to liability.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n            b.   Other Washington Cases\n\n       No Washington case has addressed whether a nonemployee\u2019s harassment can be imputed\n\nto an employer. In Antonius, a corrections officer asserted a hostile work environment claim\n\nagainst a county based in part on sexual harassment by inmates. 153 Wash. 2d at 259-60.\n\nHowever, the court only addressed whether the hostile work environment claim was timely. Id.\n\nat 261-73. The court did not consider whether the County could be liable for the harassment by\n\nthe nonemployee inmates.\n\n       Glasgow did not address the issue presented here. The court stated the circumstances in\n\nwhich harassment by an employee could be imputed to an employer. 103 Wash. 2d at 407. The\n\ncourt in Glasgow did not hold or even suggest that only an employee\u2019s harassment could be\n\nimputed to an employer.\n\n            c.   Federal Cases\n\n       LaRose relies on federal cases holding under federal law \u2013 Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e et seq.) \u2013 that employers may be liable for hostile work\n\nenvironments created by nonemployees.\n\n       In Beckford v. Department of Corrections, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stated:\n\n       It is well established that employers may be liable for failing to remedy the\n       harassment of employees by third parties who create a hostile work environment.\n       In Watson v. Blue Circle, Inc., we held that an \u201cemployer may be found liable for\n       the harassing conduct of its customers if the employer fails to take immediate and\n       appropriate corrective action in response to a hostile work environment of which\n       the employer knew or reasonably should have known.\u201d 324 F.3d 1252, 1258 n. 2\n       (11th Cir. 2003). Uniformly, our sister circuits have applied the same rule that\n       employers may be held liable under Title VII for harassment by third parties when\n       that conduct creates a hostile work environment.\n\n605 F.3d 951, 957-58 (11th Cir. 2010). The court cited to cases from eight federal circuits as\n\nsupport.\n\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n          In Little v. Windermere Relocation, Inc., the Ninth Circuit stated,\n\n          In this circuit, employers are liable for harassing conduct by non-employees \u201cwhere\n          the employer either ratifies or acquiesces in the harassment by not taking immediate\n          and/or corrective actions when it knew or should have known of the conduct.\u201d\n          Folkerson v. Circus Enters., Inc., 107 F.3d 754, 756 (9th Cir. 1997); see also\n          Lockard v. Pizza Hut, Inc., 162 F.3d 1062, 1073 (10th Cir. 1998) (adopting\n          Folkerson standard). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines\n          endorse this approach: \u201cAn employer may also be responsible for the acts of non-\n          employees, with respect to sexual harassment of employees in the workplace, where\n          the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known\n          of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.\u201d 29\n          C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11(e) (emphasis added).\n\n301 F.3d 958, 968 (9th Cir. 2002).3\n\n          In Dunn v. Washington County Hospital, the Seventh Circuit stated, \u201cBecause liability is\n\ndirect rather than derivative, it makes no difference whether the person whose acts are\n\ncomplained of is an employee, an independent contractor, or for that matter a customer. Ability\n\nto \u2018control\u2019 the actor plays no role.\u201d 429 F.3d 689, 691 (7th Cir. 2005).\n\n          The liability standard in these cases is almost identical to the standard in Glasgow for\n\nemployees: whether the employer \u201c(a) authorized, knew, or should have known of the\n\nharassment and (b) failed to take reasonably prompt and adequate corrective action.\u201d 103 Wash. 2d\n\nat 407.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    The Missouri Court of Appeals adopted the same rule under state law:\n\n          When an employee suffers discrimination by a third party who the employee comes\n          into contact with because of the employment relationship, and the harassment . . .\n          create[s] a hostile work environment, the employer breaches its duty if it knows or\n          should have known of the discrimination and fails to take prompt and effective\n          remedial action.\n\nDiaz v. Autozoners, LLC, 484 S.W.3d 64, 77 (Mo. App. 2015).\n\n\n                                                   14\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n            d.   Analysis\n\n       We conclude that DeWater does not control here. The court\u2019s opinion does include the\n\nstatement that harassment cannot be imputed to the employer \u201cunless the plaintiff shows that the\n\nperson committing the harassment is an employee.\u201d 130 Wash. 2d at 135. But that statement\n\nrelated to vicarious liability and addressed different facts. DeWater does not compel the\n\nconclusion that LaRose has no hostile work environment claim against PDA and the County\n\nbecause Smith was a nonemployee.\n\n       Because DeWater is distinguishable, we must determine as a matter of first impression\n\nwhether to allow a hostile work environment claim based on harassment in the workplace by a\n\nnonemployee under the same standards as for harassment by an employee.\n\n       Washington courts consistently look to federal case law interpreting federal\n\ndiscrimination statutes to aid in the interpretation of the WLAD. Kumar v. Gate Gourmet, Inc.,\n\n180 Wash. 2d 481, 491, 325 P.3d 193 (2014). \u201cWe have frequently recognized that while federal\n\ndiscrimination cases are not binding, they may be persuasive and their analyses adopted where\n\nthey further the purposes and mandates of state law.\u201d Antonius, 153 Wash. 2d at 266.\n\n       Relevant here, the Supreme Court has looked to federal cases interpreting Title VII when\n\nconsidering an issue of first impression regarding hostile work environment claims under the\n\nWLAD. See Robel v. Roundup Corp., 148 Wash. 2d 35, 43, 59 P.3d 611 (2002). And in Antonius,\n\nthe court relied on federal authority to address the timeliness of a hostile work environment\n\nclaim. 153 Wash. 2d at 267-70.\n\n       As discussed above, the federal cases uniformly hold that a plaintiff can assert a hostile\n\nwork environment claim under Title VII based on harassment in the workplace by a\n\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nnonemployee under standards that are consistent with Washington law for employee harassment.\n\nE.g., Beckford, 605 F.3d at 957-58.\n\n       In addition, this rule furthers the purposes of the WLAD. The legislature recognized in\n\nRCW 49.60.010 that discrimination affects \u201cthe institutions and foundation of a free democratic\n\nstate.\u201d RCW 49.60.030 establishes that the right to hold employment without discrimination is a\n\ncivil right. And the WLAD must be liberally construed. RCW 49.60.020. Liberally construed,\n\nthese broad provisions of the WLAD support a rule that employers may be subject to liability for\n\nharassment of their employees in the workplace, even harassment by nonemployees.\n\n       We adopt the federal rule and conclude that a nonemployee\u2019s harassment of an employee\n\nin the workplace will be imputed to an employer if the employer \u201c(a) authorized, knew, or should\n\nhave known of the harassment and (b) failed to take reasonably prompt and adequate corrective\n\naction.\u201d Glasgow, 103 Wash. 2d at 407. Therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that as a\n\nmatter of law PDA and the County could not be liable under the WLAD for the harassing\n\nbehavior of Smith.\n\n       3.   PDA Liability on Glasgow Elements\n\n       PDA argues that even if LaRose can assert a hostile work environment claim based on\n\nSmith\u2019s harassment, the trial court properly dismissed that claim against PDA under the facts of\n\nthis case. PDA contends that during the time it employed LaRose (until June 30, 2013), there\n\nwas no evidence that would create a genuine issue of fact regarding element three or element\n\nfour of a Glasgow hostile work environment claim. We disagree.4\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The County does not make this argument, and therefore we do not address whether summary\njudgment was appropriate in favor of the County\u2019s liability under the Glasgow factors.\n\n\n                                               16\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       First, PDA argues that LaRose did not present sufficient evidence to avoid summary\n\njudgment regarding the third element of the Glasgow test, that the harassment was sufficiently\n\npervasive to affect the conditions of her employment before June 30, 2013. Factors for the court\n\nto consider in determining if a hostile work environment claim affects the terms and conditions\n\nof employment are the frequency and severity of the discriminatory conduct, whether the\n\nconduct is physically threatening or humiliating or a mere offensive utterance, and whether the\n\nconduct unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance. Alonso v. Qwest\n\nCommc\u2019ns Co., 178 Wash. App. 734, 751, 315 P.3d 610 (2013). Whether harassing conduct\n\naffects the conditions of employment generally is a question of fact. Id.\n\n       Here, by April 2013 Smith was calling LaRose 10 to 20 times a day and making\n\ndisturbing sexual and offensive comments. The calls continued with the same frequency in May\n\nand June and were becoming more inappropriate. And in May, Smith sent LaRose a letter with\n\nsexual content that frightened her. We conclude that this evidence creates a genuine issue of fact\n\nthat the harassment affected the conditions of LaRose\u2019s employment before June 30.\n\n       Second, PDA argues that LaRose did not present sufficient evidence to avoid summary\n\njudgment regarding the fourth element of the Glasgow test \u2013 imputation of harassment to PDA \u2013\n\nbecause LaRose did not present evidence showing that PDA failed to take adequate corrective\n\naction after learning of the harassment. PDA relies on the fact that Goldsmith said, \u201cOkay\u201d\n\nwhen LaRose asked to be removed from Smith\u2019s case and that LaRose later decided to remain on\n\nthe case. However, PDA made no affirmative efforts to do anything about the harassment once\n\nthey became aware of it. We conclude that the evidence creates a genuine issue of fact whether\n\nPDA failed to take adequate corrective action after learning of the harassment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       4.   Summary\n\n       We hold that LaRose can assert a hostile work environment claim against PDA and the\n\nCounty based on Smith\u2019s harassment of her. Smith\u2019s harassment of LaRose will be imputed to\n\nPDA and the County and they will be liable if they \u201c(a) authorized, knew, or should have known\n\nof the harassment and (b) failed to take reasonably prompt and adequate corrective action.\u201d\n\nGlasgow, 103 Wash. 2d at 407.\n\n       Here, LaRose has presented evidence that creates genuine issues of fact on these\n\nimputation requirements regarding both PDA and the County. There is evidence that both had\n\nnotice of the harassment while they employed LaRose and whether they took adequate corrective\n\naction will be a question of fact for the trier of fact. In addition, LaRose presented evidence that\n\ncreates genuine issues of fact on the other contested element of a hostile work environment claim\n\nregarding PDA, and the County does not argue that there are no genuine issues of fact regarding\n\nthose elements. Therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of LaRose\u2019s hostile work\n\nenvironment claim against PDA and the County.\n\nC.     NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS \u2013 IIA BAR\n\n       LaRose argues that the trial court erred by ruling that the IIA barred her negligence\n\nclaims \u2013 breach of a special relationship duty of care and negligent infliction of emotional\n\ndistress \u2013 because a genuine issue of fact exists whether her PTSD and related injuries\n\nconstituted a compensable \u201cinjury\u201d under the IIA. She also argues that the IIA bar is\n\ninapplicable to her negligence claims under the intentional injury provision of RCW 51.24.020.\n\nWe agree with the first argument and disagree with the second argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       1.   Applicability of IIA\n\n            a.   Legal Principles\n\n       The IIA abolished all civil causes of action based on workplace injuries and abolished the\n\nsuperior court\u2019s jurisdiction over such causes of action. RCW 51.04.010. In other words,\n\nemployers generally are immunized from negligence liability. Carrera v. Olmstead, 189 Wash. 2d\n\n297, 303, 401 P.3d 304 (2017). The IIA made workers\u2019 compensation benefits the exclusive\n\nremedy for claims based on workplace injuries and occupational disease. See Dep\u2019t of Labor &\n\nIndus. v. Lyons Enters., Inc., 185 Wash. 2d 721, 733, 374 P.3d 1097 (2016).\n\n       But the IIA does not bar a tort claim against an employer if a plaintiff\u2019s injury or disease\n\narising in the workplace does not meet the IIA definition of an injury or an occupational disease.\n\nSee McCarthy v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. & Health Servs., 110 Wash. 2d 812, 817, 759 P.2d 351 (1988); see\n\nalso Rothwell v. Nine Mile Falls Sch. Dist., 173 Wash. App. 812, 819, 295 P.3d 328 (2013). In\n\nother words, the IIA bar applies only if a claim is potentially compensable under the IIA.\n\nRothwell, 173 Wash. App. at 819. As long as the IIA covers an injury or disease, the bar applies\n\neven if the claimant fails to meet the burden of proof on some component of the claim and\n\ntherefore cannot actually obtain compensation. McCarthy, 110 Wash. 2d at 824.\n\n       RCW 51.08.100 states that an \u201cinjury\u201d is a \u201csudden and tangible happening, of a\n\ntraumatic nature, producing an immediate or prompt result, and occurring from without, and such\n\nphysical conditions as result therefrom.\u201d RCW 51.08.140 defines \u201coccupational disease\u201d as\n\n\u201csuch disease or infection as arises naturally and proximately out of employment.\u201d\n\n       The Department of Labor and Industries (DLI) adopted WAC 296-14-300, which\n\naddresses mental conditions and mental disabilities. WAC 296-14-300(1) states, \u201cClaims based\n\non mental conditions or mental disabilities caused by stress do not fall within the definition of an\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\noccupational disease in RCW 51.08.140.\u201d5 The regulation provides multiple examples of such\n\nmental conditions or mental disabilities, including conditions or disabilities arising from\n\nrelationships with the public. WAC 296-14-300(1).\n\n       However, under WAC 296-14-300(2)(a), \u201c[s]tress resulting from exposure to a single\n\ntraumatic event will be adjudicated as an industrial injury.\u201d Examples of single traumatic events\n\ninclude actual or threatened physical assault and actual or threatened sexual assault. WAC 296-\n\n14-300(2)(b). And exposure to a single traumatic event is limited to directly experiencing the\n\nevent, witnessing the event happen to others, or \u201c[e]xtreme exposure to aversive details of the\n\ntraumatic event.\u201d WAC 296-14-300(2)(c).\n\n       WAC 296-14-300(2)(d) addresses multiple exposures to traumatic events.\n\n       Repeated exposure to traumatic events, none of which are a single traumatic event\n       as defined in subsection (2)(b) and (c) of this section, is not an industrial injury . . .\n       or an occupational disease. . . . A single traumatic event as defined in subsection\n       (2)(b) and (c) of this section that occurs within a series of exposures will be\n       adjudicated as an industrial injury.\n\nWAC 296-14-300(2)(d).\n\n       Under RCW 51.08.100 and WAC 296-14-300(2), a mental condition can qualify as an\n\nindustrial injury \u201cif the condition resulted from a sudden, tangible, and traumatic event that\n\nproduced an immediate result.\u201d Rothwell, 173 Wash. App. at 819-20. The event also must be \u201c \u2018of\n\nsome notoriety, fixed as to time and susceptible of investigation.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 820 (quoting Lehtinen\n\nv. Weyerhaeuser Co., 63 Wash. 2d 456, 458, 387 P.2d 760 (1963)).\n\n       A mental condition caused by long-term harassment may not qualify as an industrial\n\ninjury. \u201cThe harassment suffered by [the plaintiff] did not occur suddenly or have an immediate\n\n\n\n5\n RCW 51.08.142(1) directed DLI to adopt a rule \u201cthat claims based on mental conditions or\nmental disabilities caused by stress do not fall within the definition of occupational disease under\nRCW 51.08.140.\u201d\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nresult; rather, it consisted of a series of actions over a period of more than a year which resulted\n\nin increasing fear and depression. It would therefore not qualify as an \u2018injury.\u2019 \u201d Wheeler v.\n\nCatholic Archdiocese of Seattle, 65 Wash. App. 552, 566, 829 P.2d 196 (1992).\n\n       Whether a clamant has sustained an industrial injury is a question of fact. See Rothwell,\n\n173 Wash. App. at 818-22 (analyzing whether there was sufficient evidence to create a genuine\n\nissue of material fact regarding the existence of an injury for purposes of the IIA bar).\n\n             b.   Injury Analysis\n\n       LaRose was subjected to repeated exposure to traumatic events over several months. The\n\nquestion here is whether within this series of traumatic events, LaRose was exposed to a \u201csingle\n\ntraumatic event\u201d and thereby sustained a compensable industrial injury as defined in RCW\n\n51.08.100 and WAC 296-14-300(2).\n\n       PDA and the County focus on the deposition testimony of Dr. Shyn and Dr. Wilson. Dr.\n\nShyn testified that LaRose experienced a number of traumatic events that supported the PTSD\n\ndiagnosis.\n\n       Q. And what was the sudden traumatic event that Ms. LaRose underwent?\n       ...\n       THE WITNESS: So according to my note, Ms. LaRose was stalked by a former\n       client. This individual camped out on her property, broke into the house, threatened\n       to take her life, to kidnap her daughter, and that is what I felt represented the\n       criterion A event here.\n       ...\n       Q. Okay. So that would be the traumatic event?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. The threat to her life?\n       A. (Witness nods head).\n       Q. Okay. And breaking into her house, is that a\n       traumatic event?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Okay. And threatening her daughter -\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. -- is that a traumatic event?\n       A. Yes.\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       Q. And threatening -- it also says to shoot her\n       ex-husband after a visit. Would that be considered a\n       traumatic event?\n       A. That can be, yes.\n\nCP at 255-56.\n\n       Dr. Shyn also testified that one event involving Smith might be sufficient to support a\n\nPTSD diagnosis.\n\n       Q. Would it be accurate that each one of those events could be adequate by itself\n       for the purpose of the diagnosis?\n       A. Without cataloging each and every one of those, yes, that is certainly possible.\n       Q. You don\u2019t necessarily need to have more than one of those events --\n       A. One is enough.\n       Q. -- to support your diagnosis. Is that correct?\n       A. Yes. One is enough.\n\nCP at 258.\n\n       Dr. Wilson noted that LaRose described a number of incidents and events. He then was\n\nasked whether \u201cany one of those events might be sufficient to support PTSD,\u201d and he answered,\n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d CP at 247.\n\n       LaRose relies on the subsequent declarations of Dr. Shyn and Dr. Wilson, in which they\n\nprovided nearly identical opinions. Dr. Shyn stated:\n\n       17. It is my professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that\n       the cause of Ms. LaRose\u2019 [sic] diagnosed conditions is the cumulative effect and\n       experience of the events and contributing factors generally described in Paragraphs\n       13-15 above.\n       18. In my professional opinion, where all of Ms. LaRose\u2019s medical treatment and\n       diagnoses took place after nearly two years of stalking related events, it is not\n       medically appropriate to try to single out any one event, as if it were separate from\n       the others, to determine whether that single event or point in time, was for Ms.\n       LaRose, by itself, a separate trauma which actually would have caused Ms.\n       LaRose\u2019s diagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression, and\n       Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n\nCP at 647.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       Dr. Wilson stated:\n\n       1. In my deposition taken by counsel for King County and the TDA I was asked at\n       pages 76-77 if I recalled Dr. Shyn\u2019s deposition testimony that any one of these\n       events was sufficient to his diagnosis of PTSD of Ms. LaRose, between the event\n       at the car or the event in the backyard for example. As I testified any one of them\n       could be a cause of PTSD suffered by Sheila LaRose, although in this case we have\n       numbers of incidents and events that are described by Ms. LaRose.\n       2. It is my opinion, however, to a reasonable degree of medical probability that the\n       cause of Ms. LaRose\u2019s diagnosed conditions is the combination of events \u2013 the\n       cumulative effect and experience of the events and contributing factors experienced\n       by Ms. LaRose.\n       3. It is also my professional opinion, where all of Ms. LaRose\u2019s medical treatment\n       and diagnoses took place after nearly two years of stalking related events, it is not\n       medically appropriate to try and single out any one event, as if they were separate\n       from the others, to determine whether that single event or point in time, was for Ms.\n       LaRose, by itself, a separate trauma which actually would have caused Ms.\n       LaRose\u2019s diagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression, and\n       Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n\nCP at 659-60.\n\n       The declarations of Dr. Shyn and Dr. Wilson create genuine issues of material fact on\n\ntwo issues. First, RCW 51.08.100 states that the traumatic happening must produce an\n\n\u201cimmediate or prompt result.\u201d Here, LaRose certainly was upset immediately by Smith\u2019s\n\nharassment. But she was not diagnosed with PTSD until March 2015. Even if certain singular\n\ntraumatic events in 2013 and 2014 could be identified, there is a question of fact whether they\n\nproduced an immediate result.\n\n       Second, both Dr. Shyn and Dr. Wilson opined that no one harassing event could be\n\nsingled out from the others as the cause of LaRose\u2019s PTSD. These opinions arguably are\n\ninconsistent with Dr. Shyn\u2019s deposition testimony that certain conduct of Smith constituted\n\ntraumatic events that were sufficient to support her PTSD diagnosis. But they create a question\n\nof fact whether one or more single traumatic events as defined in WAC 296-14-300(2) caused\n\nLaRose\u2019s PTSD and other mental conditions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       Because genuine questions of fact exist, we hold that the trial court erred in determining\n\nas a matter of law that LaRose suffered an industrial injury under RCW 51.08.100. Accordingly,\n\nwe remand for the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n\n            c.   Effect of LaRose\u2019s IIA Claims \u2013 Collateral Estoppel\n\n       LaRose filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for psychological injury in April 2016. She\n\nhad been diagnosed with PTSD in March 2015. Under the IIA, an injury claim must be filed\n\nwithin one year and an occupational disease claim must be filed within two years after the injury\n\noccurred. RCW 51.28.050 (injury); RCW 51.28.055 (disease).\n\n       DLI denied LaRose\u2019s injury claim because it was not filed within a year after the injury\n\noccurred and denied an occupational disease claim because LaRose\u2019s condition was not an\n\noccupational disease under RCW 51.08.142 and WAC 296-14-300. LaRose appealed DLI\u2019s\n\ndecision to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (BIIA). On appeal, LaRose stipulated that\n\n\u201cthis claim is brought exclusively as an occupational disease, and not as an \u2018injury\u2019 within the\n\nmeaning of RCW 51.08.100.\u201d CP at 2884.\n\n       The BIIA affirmed DLI\u2019s decision. Both the proposed decision and order and the final\n\norder included a finding of fact that LaRose applied for benefits based on an occupational\n\ndisease that caused PTSD and major depressive disorder \u201cbrought about by repeated exposure to\n\ntraumatic events (none of which amounted to an Industrial Injury).\u201d CP at 734, 739.\n\n       LaRose appears to argue that PDA and the County should be collaterally estopped from\n\nnow claiming that she had a valid injury claim because the BIIA determined that she had not\n\nsuffered an injury under the IIA. However, one of the elements of collateral estoppel is that the\n\nissue decided in the prior action was identical to the one presented in the second action. Dot\n\nFoods, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Rev., 185 Wash. 2d 239, 254, 372 P.3d 747 (2016). The BIIA did not rule\n\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nthat LaRose did not have an injury claim; LaRose stipulated that she was not asserting such a\n\nclaim. Therefore, collateral estoppel does not apply to whether LaRose suffered an injury under\n\nthe IIA.\n\n       The BIIA\u2019s ruling that LaRose had not suffered an occupational disease may be binding\n\nin this action under collateral estoppel principles. However, PDA and the County do not argue\n\non appeal that LaRose\u2019s PTSD and other mental conditions constituted an occupational disease.\n\nFurther, LaRose appealed the BIIA\u2019s determination to superior court, which apparently ruled that\n\nshe is entitled to a hearing on her IIA claim. LaRose concedes that her negligence claims are\n\nmoot if she prevails on her occupational disease claim and is able to obtain workers\u2019\n\ncompensation benefits.\n\n             d.   Summary\n\n       Whether LaRose sustained an industrial injury as defined under the IIA must be\n\ndetermined by the trier of fact. If she did sustain an industrial injury, the IIA bar applies. In\n\naddition, if a final decision in LaRose\u2019s industrial disease claim ultimately determines that\n\nLaRose in fact suffered an industrial disease, the IIA bar will apply and the industrial injury issue\n\nwill be moot.\n\n       2.    RCW 51.24.020 \u2013 Deliberate Injury\n\n       LaRose argues that the IIA bar is inapplicable under RCW 51.24.020 because the\n\nevidence shows that PDA and the County deliberately injured her. She argues that a question of\n\nmaterial fact exists as to whether PDA and the County had actual knowledge that an injury was\n\ncertain to occur. We disagree.\n\n       Under RCW 51.24.020, a workplace injury is not barred by the IIA \u201c[i]f injury results to\n\na worker from the deliberate intention of his or her employer to produce such injury.\u201d See\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nMichelbrink v. Wash. State Patrol, 191 Wash. App. 414, 422, 363 P.3d 6 (2015). For the statute to\n\napply, the employer must have a specific intent to injure the employee. Birklid v. Boeing Co.,\n\n127 Wash. 2d 853, 860, 904 P.2d 278 (1995). Neither gross negligence nor an act that has a\n\nsubstantial certainty of causing injury is sufficient to show an intent to injure. Id. The Supreme\n\nCourt has expressly refused to equate deliberate intention to injure with substantial certainty that\n\nan injury will occur. Id. at 865.\n\n       To prove that an employer\u2019s actions fall within the deliberate intention exception an\n\nemployee must demonstrate that \u201c(1) \u2018the employer had actual knowledge that an injury was\n\ncertain to occur\u2019 and (2) the employer \u2018willfully disregarded that knowledge.\u2019 \u201d Michelbrink,\n\n191 Wash. App. at 423 (quoting Birklid, 127 Wash. 2d at 865).\n\n       LaRose argues that PDA intentionally injured her by assigning her to represent Smith\n\ngiven her supervisors\u2019 knowledge that he was a repeat stalker of professional women. She\n\npresented evidence that Smith had been charged with stalking professional women multiple\n\ntimes and that Smith previously had acted inappropriately toward a female defense attorney.\n\nTherefore, PDA may have known that assigning a man accused of stalking women to a woman\n\ndefense attorney made mental injuries to LaRose possible or even foreseeable. But LaRose\n\npresented no evidence that PDA had any knowledge that mental injuries were certain to occur\n\nwhen they assigned her to represent Smith.\n\n       LaRose also argues that PDA and the County intentionally injured her by not removing\n\nher from Smith\u2019s case after he began harassing her. She presented evidence that she told her\n\nsupervisors repeatedly that Smith was making harassing calls to her and that his offensive\n\ncomments were escalating. At that point, PDA and the County may have known that mental\n\ninjuries to LaRose were possible or even substantially certain to occur. But LaRose presented no\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nevidence that PDA or the County had any knowledge that mental injuries were certain to occur\n\nwhen they failed to remove her from Smith\u2019s case.\n\n       We interpret the deliberate intention exception narrowly. Id. at 426. And if a defendant\n\nshows that there is an absence of evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim in a summary\n\njudgment motion, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to set forth specific facts that show a genuine\n\nissue of material fact. Zonnebloem, 200 Wash. App. at 183. LaRose has not presented specific\n\nfacts to satisfy her burden here. Accordingly, we hold that RCW 51.24.020 does not preclude\n\napplication of the IIA bar.\n\n       3.   Evidence of Negligence\n\n       PDA and the County argue that even if the IIA bar does not apply, summary judgment\n\nwas appropriate because LaRose cannot show that they breached any standard of care.        PDA\n\nalso argues that LaRose cannot establish proximate cause. We disagree.\n\n            a.    Legal Principles\n\n       To establish a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish (1) the existence of a duty, (2)\n\nbreach of that duty, (3) resulting injury, and (4) proximate cause. Wuthrich v. King County, 185\n\nWash. 2d 19, 25, 366 P.3d 926 (2016).\n\n       In general a person has no duty to protect another from intentional harm by a third party.\n\nH.B.H. v. State, 192 Wash. 2d 154, 168, 429 P.3d 484 (2018). However, an exception to this rule is\n\nwhen a special relationship exists between a person and another that gives the other a right to\n\nprotection. Id; see RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 315(b) (AM. LAW INST. 1965).\n\n       The employer-employee relationship is one that creates a duty to protect against a third\n\nparty\u2019s criminal conduct. Bartlett v. Hantover, 9 Wash. App. 614, 620-21, 513 P.2d 844 (1973),\n\nrev\u2019d on other grounds, 84 Wash. 2d 426, 526 P.2d 1217 (1974).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       [A]n employer owes to an employee a duty to provide a safe place to work. The\n       employer has a duty to make reasonable provision against foreseeable dangers of\n       criminal misconduct to which the employment exposes the employee. Where the\n       nature of the work is such that it exposes the employee to the risk of injury from\n       the criminal acts of third persons, a jury question is raised as to whether the\n       employer has been negligent in not foreseeing the risk of criminal acts and acting\n       to protect employees against the danger.\n\nBartlett, 9 Wash. App. at 620-21 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court confirmed this duty in\n\nNivens v. 7-11 Hoagy\u2019s Corner, citing Bartlett for the proposition that an \u201cemployer has a duty\n\nto make reasonable provision against foreseeable dangers of criminal misconduct to which the\n\nemployment exposes the employee.\u201d 133 Wash. 2d 192, 201, 943 P.2d 286 (1997).\n\n            b.   PDA Liability\n\n       LaRose claims that PDA was negligent in assigning her to represent Smith given his\n\nhistory of stalking. PDA argues that it had no reason to foresee that Smith would harass or stalk\n\nLaRose. However, the evidence LaRose presented that Smith had a history of stalking women\n\nand that he made inappropriate comments to another public defender that caused PDA to assign a\n\nprior case to a male is sufficient to create a question of fact on this issue. And PDA does not\n\nargue that there is no question of fact regarding proximate cause on this claim.\n\n       In addition, LaRose also claims that PDA was negligent in not removing her from\n\nSmith\u2019s cases once it learned of the harassment. PDA argues that it agreed to reassign the case\n\nafter receiving notice of the harassment, but LaRose opted to continue representing Smith.\n\nHowever, given PDA\u2019s duty to protect LaRose, a genuine issue of fact exists whether PDA\n\nshould have removed LaRose from the case regardless of LaRose\u2019s wishes.\n\n       PDA also argues that LaRose cannot establish that its failure to remove LaRose from the\n\ncase proximately caused her harm. PDA claims that there is no way to determine whether\n\nremoving LaRose from the case would have prevented Smith from stalking her. However, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nharassment only started in March 2013. The evidence showed that Smith\u2019s harassment\n\ncontinued to escalate and become more inappropriate over the next four months while LaRose\n\ncontinued to represent him. On the other hand, Smith did not continue to harass the prior public\n\ndefender when she was removed from the case immediately after Smith made inappropriate\n\ncomments to her. It is reasonable to infer for purposes of summary judgment that Smith\u2019s\n\nharassment would have stopped if PDA also had immediately removed LaRose from Smith\u2019s\n\ncase.\n\n        We hold that PDA is not entitled to summary judgment on the merits of LaRose\u2019s\n\nnegligence claims.\n\n            c.   County Liability\n\n        LaRose claims that the County was negligent in failing to remove her from the case after\n\nthe County became her employer on July 1, 2013. The County argues that LaRose cannot\n\nestablish any breach of the duty of care because the testimony of her liability expert should be\n\nexcluded and without that testimony LaRose presented no evidence of breach.6 However, the\n\nCounty knew when it became LaRose\u2019s employer that Smith had been harassing her for three\n\nmonths. Given the County\u2019s duty to protect LaRose, a genuine issue of fact exists whether it\n\nshould have removed LaRose from the case in July 2013.7\n\n        There also may be a question of fact regarding whether the County should have done\n\nmore to protect LaRose once Smith was released from incarceration in November 2013 and his\n\nstalking escalated. During that time, LaRose let Hamaji know that the unwanted sexual calls at\n\n\n\n6\n The County does not argue that its failure to remove LaRose from the case proximately caused\nher harm. Therefore, we do not address proximate cause.\n7\n We hold that a question of fact exists regardless of the liability expert\u2019s testimony. Therefore,\nwe do not address the admissibility of that testimony.\n\n\n                                                29\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nwork had not stopped. And LaRose sent emails to County management detailing Smith\u2019s\n\nstalking of her home. However, the record does not show what steps, if any, the County took to\n\nprotect LaRose from this conduct.\n\n       We hold that the County is not entitled to summary judgment on the merits of LaRose\u2019s\n\nnegligence claims.\n\nD.     DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION CLAIM\n\n       LaRose argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her disability discrimination claim.\n\nShe argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether the County accommodated her disability and whether the County\n\ntreated her differently because of her disability.8 We disagree.\n\n       1.   Failure to Accommodate\n\n       Under the WLAD, an employer has an affirmative duty to accommodate an employee\u2019s\n\ndisability. Frisino v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 160 Wash. App. 765, 777, 249 P.3d 1044 (2011).\n\nThe employee claiming failure to accommodate a disability has the burden of proving that (1)\n\nshe suffered from a disability, (2) she was qualified to do the job in question, (3) she gave notice\n\nof the disability to her employer, and (4) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the\n\ndisability. Slack v. Luke, 192 Wash. App. 909, 917, 370 P.3d 49 (2016). However, \u201c[t]he duty of\n\nan employer to accommodate reasonably an employee\u2019s disability does not arise until the\n\nemployer is aware of the employee\u2019s disability.\u201d Anica v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 120 Wash. App.\n\n481, 489-90, 84 P.3d 1231 (2004).\n\n\n\n\n8\n  LaRose also briefly argues that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her\ndisability. However, she presents no evidence that a hostile work environment existed based on\nthe County\u2019s response to her disability.\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       Here, LaRose was first diagnosed with PTSD in March 2015. LaRose submitted a\n\nmedical leave request at that time, which the County granted. Later in 2015, LaRose requested\n\nthat she not be assigned to new cases and for help in closing cases as she prepared to take a leave\n\nof absence. The County accommodated those requests.\n\n       LaRose argues that the County did not enter into an interactive process to accommodate\n\nher disability in 2013 and 2014. She argues that she was suffering increasing work-related stress\n\nand that her work was negatively affecting her mental health. However, LaRose\u2019s work-related\n\nstress does not qualify as an impairment under former RCW 49.60.040(25)(c)(ii) (2009). And\n\nthe County did not have a duty to accommodate LaRose\u2019s disability until it was made aware of\n\nher medical diagnosis of PTSD in March 2015.\n\n       LaRose failed to meet her burden of creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding\n\nthe County\u2019s failure to accommodate her disability. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did\n\nnot err in granting summary judgment in favor of the County on LaRose\u2019s failure to\n\naccommodate claim.\n\n       2.    Disparate Treatment\n\n       LaRose also apparently argues that PDA and the County violated chapter 49.60 RCW by\n\ntreating her differently based on her disability.\n\n       Under the WLAD, an employer is prohibited from discriminating against an employee on\n\nthe basis of a disability. RCW 49.60.180; see Blackburn v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. & Health Servs., 186\n\nWash. 2d 250, 258, 375 P.3d 1076 (2016). An employee suffering from a disability can establish a\n\nclaim of disparate treatment by showing that the employer took an adverse employment action\n\nand the action occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference that the action\n\n\n\n\n                                                    31\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nconstituted unlawful discrimination. Marin v. King County, 194 Wash. App. 795, 808, 378 P.3d\n\n203(2016).\n\n       Here, LaRose claims that her supervisors refused to engage with her and withheld support\n\nas she was dealing with the stress of her work. She claims that her supervisors transferred her to\n\nanother division and failed to help her get coverage for upcoming cases so that she could take\n\ntime off. However, the supervisors\u2019 behavior that LaRose complains of took place in 2014 and\n\nearly 2015, before LaRose was diagnosed with PTSD.\n\n       LaRose failed to show a genuine issue of material fact regarding her disparate treatment\n\nclaim. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the County on LaRose\u2019s disparate treatment claim.\n\nE.     COUNTY\u2019S VICARIOUS LIABILITY\n\n       The County argues on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in denying its motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the issue of vicarious liability and ruling as a matter of law that it was\n\nvicariously liable for the conduct of PDA before July 2013. We agree.\n\n       1.    Legal Principles\n\n       In general, a principal is vicariously liable for the conduct of its \u201cagent.\u201d Wilcox v.\n\nBasehore, 187 Wash. 2d 772, 789-90, 389 P.3d 531 (2017). On the other hand, a principal is not\n\nvicariously liable for the conduct of an actor who can be characterized as an independent\n\ncontractor. Id.\n\n       The crucial distinction between an agent and an independent contractor is whether the\n\nsuperior business party has the right to control the details of the subordinate business party\u2019s\n\nperformance. Id. If the superior party does not have the right to control, the subordinate party is\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nan independent contractor. Id. at 790. Whether the superior party actually exercises control is\n\nimmaterial as long as there is a right to control. Id. at 789.\n\n       Whether a party is an agent or an independent contractor can be determined as a matter of\n\nlaw if the facts are not in dispute and are subject to only one interpretation. Id. at 790.\n\n       2.    Dolan v. King County\n\n       The trial court relied on Dolan v. King County, 172 Wash. 2d 299, 258 P.3d 20 (2011), in\n\ndetermining that the County was vicariously liable for PDA\u2019s conduct. In Dolan, employees of\n\nthe County\u2019s public defender organizations filed a class action lawsuit seeking to enroll in the\n\nstate retirement system, PERS (Public Employees Retirement System). Id. at 308. The Supreme\n\nCourt held that the public defenders should be considered the County\u2019s \u201cemployees\u201d for\n\npurposes of PERS eligibility. Id. at 301.\n\n       The court stated that under the common law, the \u201cbedrock principle\u201d for distinguishing\n\nbetween employees and independent contractors is the right of control. Id. at 314. The court\n\nstated there was \u201cno dispute that the defender organizations [had] autonomy to make day-to-day\n\ndecisions on the representation of indigent clients.\u201d Id. at 307. But the court expressly rejected\n\nthe County\u2019s argument that the focus should be on whether the County interfered with the\n\ndefender organizations\u2019 day-to-day activities. Id. at 318. The court stated that because public\n\ndefenders are guided by ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations, \u201cinsistence on the\n\ntraditional test of control over the details of the employee\u2019s day-to-day job performance is\n\nunworkable in this context.\u201d Id. at 318 n.15.\n\n       The court emphasized that a number of \u201cexamples of the county\u2019s right to control the\n\ndefender organizations support our conclusion that, under common law principles, the defender\n\norganizations are in fact agencies of the county.\u201d Id. at 319. The court concluded, \u201c[W]e hold\n\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nthat the county has exerted such a right of control over the defender organizations as to make\n\nthem agencies of the county.\u201d Id. at 320. As a result, the court held that employees of the\n\ndefender organizations were county employees for purposes of PERS. Id.\n\n       However, the court indicated that its holding would not necessarily apply to whether the\n\nCounty was vicariously liable for conduct of the defender organizations. Id. at 320-21. The\n\nCounty argued that collateral estoppel applied based on a superior court\u2019s ruling in an unrelated\n\ncase that a public defender was not a County employee for purposes of the public defender\u2019s\n\nwrongful termination claim. Id. at 320-21. The court in Dolan emphasized that the issue in that\n\nunrelated case was whether the County was vicariously liable for employment discrimination,\n\nwhile the issue in Dolan was whether public defenders were PERS eligible. Id. at 321. The\n\ncourt stated, \u201cThe cases are not comparable.\u201d Id. at 321.\n\n       3.   Analysis\n\n            a.   Applicability of Dolan\n\n       LaRose argues that the County is vicariously liable for the conduct of PDA because the\n\nSupreme Court held in Dolan that PDA employees were employees of the County. But Dolan is\n\nnot directly applicable here. The court\u2019s holding in Dolan was limited to the context of\n\nretirement benefits eligibility. The court expressly stated that whether a public defender was a\n\nCounty employee for PERS purposes was different than whether the County was vicariously\n\nliable for employment discrimination. Dolan, 172 Wash. 2d at 321.\n\n       The Supreme Court has stated that a test to determine the nature of the relationship\n\nbetween a principal and a subordinate party, such as the right of control test, may reach two\n\ndifferent results under the same facts depending on the purpose of deploying the test. See Fisher\n\nv. City of Seattle, 62 Wash. 2d 800, 803-05, 384 P.2d 852 (1963). That is the situation here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\nAlthough the inquiries into whether a public defender is entitled to PERS benefits and whether\n\nthe County is liable for the PDA\u2019s conduct may both employ the right-of-control test, the two\n\ninquiries are distinct. Therefore, a conclusion in one context that the County exerted a right of\n\ncontrol over PDA does not compel a conclusion that the County had a right of control here.\n\n       We conclude that Dolan does not control the vicarious liability determination. Therefore,\n\nwe apply the right of control test to the facts here independent of the holding in Dolan.\n\n            b.   Control Test\n\n       Here, the County presented evidence that before July 2013, the supervision of attorneys,\n\ncase assignments, and issues of case management were directed by PDA employees operating\n\nunder PDA policies, without the County\u2019s involvement. LaRose does not dispute these facts.\n\nAnd LaRose presents no argument on this issue other than that Dolan controls. Even taken in the\n\nlight most favorable to LaRose, these facts support the conclusion that the County did not control\n\nthe manner of performance of PDA employees prior to July 2013. And there is no indication that\n\nthe County had the right to control PDA\u2019s performance of its day-to-day duties. For vicariously\n\nliability purposes in the context of employment-based claims, we hold that PDA must be treated\n\nas an independent contractor rather than as an agent.\n\n       We conclude that the County is not vicariously liable for the conduct of PDA prior to\n\nJuly 2013. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in denying the County\u2019s summary\n\njudgment motion.\n\nF.     ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n\n       LaRose requests attorney fees on appeal under RCW 49.60.030. We may grant an award\n\nof reasonable attorney fees under RAP 18.1(a) if allowed under the applicable law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fNo. 50858-3-II\n\n\n       A prevailing party may recover reasonable attorney fees on appeal under RCW\n\n49.60.030(2). Bright v. Frank Russell Invs., 191 Wash. App. 73, 86, 361 P.3d 245 (2015).\n\nHowever, although LaRose substantially prevails on appeal, the prevailing party in the case\n\nultimately will be determined on remand. Therefore, we decline to award attorney fees to\n\nLaRose at this time.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       We reverse the trial court\u2019s order dismissing LaRose\u2019s hostile work environment claims,\n\nreverse the trial court\u2019s order dismissing LaRose\u2019s negligence claims, affirm the trial court\u2019s\n\norder dismissing LaRose\u2019s disability discrimination claim, and reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that\n\nthe County is vicariously liable for PDA\u2019s conduct. We remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                     MAXA, C.J.\n\n\n\n We concur:\n\n\n\n\n JOHANSON, J.\n\n\n\n LEE, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\f",
