STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                    Appeal from the Criminal Court for Davidson County\n                            No. 93-C-1154   Steve Dozier, Judge\n\n\n\n                     No. M2003-00557-CCA-R3-PC - Filed July 13, 2004\n\n\nThe petitioner, Steven Griffin, appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for forensic DNA\nanalysis, pursuant to the Post-Conviction DNA Analysis Act of 2001. Our review discloses that the\ntrial court ruled correctly, and we affirm the denial of the petitioner\u2019s request.\n\n              Tenn. R. App. P. 3; Judgment of the Criminal Court is Affirmed.\n\nJAMES CURWOOD WITT , JR., J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which JOHN EVERETT\nWILLIAMS, J., joined. JOSEPH M. TIPTON , J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n\nSteven Griffin, Appellant, Pro Se.\n\nPaul G. Summers, Attorney General & Reporter; Brent C. Cherry, Assistant Attorney General;\nVictor S. Johnson, III, District Attorney General; and Doug Thurman, Assistant District Attorney\nGeneral, for the Appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                           OPINION\n\n               While serving his eighty-five-year sentence for aggravated kidnapping and six counts\nof aggravated rape, the petitioner filed a written request with the Davidson County Criminal Court\nin late December of 2002, asking that all human biological evidence in the state\u2019s possession or\ncontrol and related to his convictions be submitted for DNA analysis. As grounds, the petitioner\nclaimed that no comparison of the victim\u2019s and his DNA had ever been performed and that a\n\u201cprobability does exist that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted and/or convicted if\nexculpatory results had been obtained through DNA analysis.\u201d Previously, the petitioner had\nunsuccessfully attacked his convictions on direct appeal, through the post-conviction process, and\nthrough federal habeas corpus avenues. See Steven Craig Griffin v. State, No. 01C01-9801-CR-\n00004 (Tenn. Crim. App., Nashville, May 6, 1999), perm. app. denied (Tenn. 1999) (post-\nconviction); State v. Steven Craig Griffin, No. 01C01-9404-CR-00144 (Tenn. Crim. App., Nashville,\nJun. 28, 1995), perm. app. denied (Tenn. 1995) (direct appeal).\n\f               The state filed a motion to dismiss and raised two issues. First, it asserted that no\nDNA evidence existed that would be capable of being tested. Second, it maintained that, in\nconnection with the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the denial of his post-conviction petition, the trial\ncourt\u2019s determination that DNA evidence was irrelevant to the consensual sex defense was affirmed,\nthereby undermining any claim that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted.\n\n               The Davidson County trial court to which the petitioner\u2019s current motion was\nassigned treated the application as a petition to reopen the earlier post-conviction proceedings and\ndenied same on February 13, 2003, with the following explanation:\n\n                       As to the petitioner\u2019s first claim raised in his initial post-\n               conviction proceeding, the trial court found that questions regarding\n               DNA were irrelevant because the petitioner\u2019s theory was consensual\n               intercourse with the victim. Secondly, the petitioner demanded a\n               speedy trial within 180 days under the Interstate Compact on\n               Detainers Act . . . thereby not providing sufficient time for DNA\n               testing. The Court is of the opinion that the defendant opted out of\n               DNA testing. . . .\n\n                       The petitioner\u2019s current petition to re-open post-conviction\n               proceedings requests that any physical evidence in existence be\n               subjected to a DNA analysis. The petitioner was afforded a serology\n               analysis and those results were made known prior to the trial in this\n               matter. The Court reviewed the audio tapes of the petitioner\u2019s\n               original trial in this matter. Indeed, the petitioner\u2019s defense\n               maintained that the victim consented to intercourse. Based on this\n               defense, the petitioner\u2019s prior post-conviction petition raising this\n               issue and the Court of Criminal Appeals ruling, the Court is of the\n               opinion that [t]he petitioner\u2019s petition to re-open post-conviction\n               should be respectfully denied.\n\nThe court made no findings relative to the existence of any evidence containing DNA that could be\nanalyzed.\n\n                On appeal, the petitioner appears pro se. He maintains that the trial court should not\nhave summarily dismissed his petition for DNA analysis without appointing counsel to represent\nhim, without affording an opportunity for the petition to be amended, and without an evidentiary\nhearing. The petitioner also airs other complaints in the nature of counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance\nand restrictions on cross-examination of the state\u2019s expert serologist at trial; we decline to address\nthese latter complaints, as they clearly fall outside the ambit of the Post-Conviction DNA Analysis\nAct of 2001. See Ricky Flamingo Brown, Sr. v. State, No. M2002-02427-CCA-R3-PC (Tenn. Crim.\nApp., Nashville, June 13, 2003) (Act does not permit petitioner to appeal unrelated claims or reargue\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fthe issues raised in his previous, unsuccessful petition for post-conviction relief), perm. app. denied\n(Tenn. 2003).\n\n              The Post-Conviction DNA Analysis Act of 2001 provides in relevant part that a\nperson convicted of aggravated rape\n\n                  may at any time, file a petition requesting the forensic DNA analysis\n                  of any evidence that is in the possession or control of the prosecution,\n                  law enforcement, laboratory, or court, and that is related to the\n                  investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of\n                  conviction and that may contain biological evidence.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-303 (2003). There is no statute of limitations barring the filing of a\npetition seeking forensic DNA analysis, see Willie Tom Ensley v. State, No. M2002-01609-CCA-R3-\nPC (Tenn. Crim. App., Nashville, Apr. 11, 2003), but the Act incorporates specific qualifying criteria\nthat must be satisfied before a court orders DNA analysis. Relevant to this case,1 those conditions\nare:\n\n                  (1) A reasonable probability exists that the petitioner would not have\n                  been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained\n                  through DNA analysis;\n\n                  (2) The evidence is still in existence and in such a condition that\n                  DNA analysis may be conducted;\n\n                  (3) The evidence was never previously subjected to DNA analysis or\n                  was not subjected to the analysis that is now requested which could\n                  resolve an issue not resolved by previous analysis; and\n\n                  (4) The application for analysis is made for the purpose of\n                  demonstrating innocence and not to unreasonably delay the execution\n                  of sentence or administration of justice.\n\nId. \u00a7 40-30-304 (2003).\n\n\n\n\n         1\n            The Act incorporates two separate sets of qualifying criteria. Code section 40-30-304 addresses a situation\ninvolving a \u201creasonable probability . . . that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-30-304 (2003) (emphasis added). Code section 40-30-305 is written to include the existence of a \u201creasonable\nprobability . . . that analysis of the evidence will produce DNA results which would have rendered the petitioner\u2019s verdict\nor sentence more favorable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40-30-305 (2003) (emphasis added). In the instant petition, the petitioner alleged\na Code section 40-30-304 basis for relief that he would not have been prosecuted and/or convicted had DNA analysis\nbeen performed.\n\n                                                           -3-\n\f               The propriety of summarily dismissing a petition requesting analysis and the\nconstruction of the Act was examined at length in William D. Buford v. State, No. M2002-02180-\nCCA-R3-PC (Tenn. Crim. App., Nashville, Apr. 24, 2003). From Buford, we distill that the Post-\nConviction DNA Analysis Act of 2001 contemplates the summary dismissal of a petition requesting\nanalysis \u201cunder appropriate circumstances.\u201d William D. Buford, slip op. at 6. The Buford court\nexplained,\n\n                [I]f the contents of a petition establish a prima facie case and, after\n                any response by the state, the trial court determines all statutory\n                prerequisites are present, a petitioner convicted of one of the\n                statutorily enumerated crimes is entitled to DNA analysis. See Tenn.\n                Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-[3]04. If the state contests the presence of any\n                qualifying criteria and it is apparent that each prerequisite cannot be\n                established, the trial court has the authority to dismiss the petition.\n                Considerable latitude must be given to trial courts in gathering the\n                necessary information for the decision. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\n                40-30-[3]11 (\u201cThe court may in its discretion make such other orders\n                as may be appropriate.\u201d).\n\nWilliam D. Buford, slip op. at 7.\n\n                 As we view the matter in the case before us, there are four issues to be addressed.\nThe first issue relates to the trial court\u2019s treatment of the request for DNA analysis as a petition to\nreopen the earlier post-conviction proceeding. The second issue involves the adequacy of the state\u2019s\nresponse that \u201c[n]o DNA evidence exists which could be subject to testing or analysis at this time.\u201d\nThe third issue is whether, as a matter of law, the \u201cconsensual sex defense\u201d that the petitioner\npursued at trial defeats the need for testing. The last issue is whether, to secure relief pursuant to the\nAct, the petitioner must demonstrate that he did not waive DNA testing in earlier proceedings.\n\n                 As for the first issue, we conclude that the court should not have treated the\npetitioner\u2019s request as a petition to reopen his earlier post-conviction proceedings. The procedure\nfor applying to reopen an earlier post-conviction petition is set forth in considerable detail in Code\nsection 40-30-117. A court order for DNA analysis, granted pursuant to the Post-Conviction DNA\nAnalysis Act of 2001, however, does not automatically supply adequate grounds to support the\nreopening of an earlier petition. Before an earlier petition can be reopened, a petitioner must show,\ninter alia, that \u201cnew scientific evidence establish[es] that such petitioner is actually innocent of the\noffense or offenses for which the petitioner was convicted\u201d or that \u201cthe facts underlying the claim,\nif true, would establish by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner is entitled to have the\nconviction set aside or the sentenced reduced.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-117(a)(2), (4) (2003). To\nbe sure, if DNA analysis, ordered pursuant to the Act, ultimately yielded scientific results\nexculpatory to the petitioner, then adequate grounds may well exist to reopen the earlier petition.\nNonetheless, the two procedures are distinct and should not be confused. See Ray v. State, 984\nS.W.2d 236, 238 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997) (section 40-30-117(a)(2) does not provide petitioner a\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\fvehicle for obtaining discovery; rather, petitioner must delineate in the motion to reopen the new\nscientific evidence that has already been secured). As Buford explains, the task of the court\nreviewing a request for DNA analysis is to (1) examine the contents of the petition, (2) determine\nif the petition alleges a prima facie case for relief, (3) consider any response that the state may offer,\nand (4) determine if the statutory criteria are present. See William D. Buford, slip op. at 7.\n\n               We turn next to the state\u2019s response to the trial court that \u201c[n]o DNA evidence exists\nwhich could be subject to testing or analysis at this time.\u201d On appeal, the state qualifies that\nassertion and candidly points out in its appellate brief,\n\n                         The \u2018State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Petitioner\u2019s Request for\n                Forensic DNA Analysis\u2019 asserted that \u2018[n]o DNA evidence exists\n                which could be subject to testing or analysis at this time.\u2019 (TR, 7) If\n                in fact no evidence were in existence, a second condition of the\n                statute would fail, further negating any duty by the court to take\n                action. However, the record indicates that \u201c[b]lood, saliva, and oral\n                and vaginal swabbings were obtained from the victim. A serologist\n                testified that the presence of sperm was detected in both the vaginal\n                and oral swabs. Blood, saliva and hair belonging to both defendant\n                and the victim\u2019s husband were analyzed.\u201d State v. [Steven Craig]\n                Griffin[, No. 01C01-9404-CR-00144 on direct appeal] at *7. The\n                State\u2019s motion offered no explanation regarding evidence which\n                might have existed previously or regarding efforts to locate evidence\n                still existing. The lower court made no findings regarding the\n                existence or condition of evidence which might be subjected to DNA\n                analysis.\n\n               Buford spoke of the \u201c[c]onsiderable latitude\u201d that must be given to trial courts \u201cin\ngathering the necessary information\u201d to determine if the petitioner is entitled to DNA analysis. The\ncourt in Buford then emphasized, \u201cBecause the trial court here made a conscientious effort to\ndetermine the existence of the statutory conditions and had substantial facts upon which to\ndetermine that the biological specimens were no longer available, a summary dismissal was\nappropriate.\u201d William D. Buford, slip op. at 7 (emphasis added). Among the substantial facts was\nthe prosecution\u2019s affidavit stating, based upon \u201cthe records of the law enforcement agencies, the\nprosecution, and the trial court clerk\u201d that no specimen existed. Id., slip op. at 6.\n\n                In this case, the court had no facts, substantial or otherwise, upon which a\ndetermination could rest that biological specimens were no longer available. All the court had before\nit was a conflict in the pleadings about the existence of DNA evidence. Because the state was\nseeking a summary dismissal of the petition, we regard the state\u2019s obligation in responding to the\npetition as requiring more than a blanket, unsworn assertion that no such evidence exists. If the state\nis remiss in providing an explanation or if its explanation is not sufficiently detailed, the trial court\nhas an obligation to make reasonable factual inquiries before dismissing the petition. We do not\n\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fsuggest that trial courts must or should conduct lengthy or protracted evidentiary hearings on the\nmatter; we anticipate that trial courts will exercise sound discretion to streamline the inquiry, for\ninstance, by placing the onus on the state to supply sufficient, reliable information.\n\n              In this case, the state\u2019s general, unsworn assertion that no testable evidence exists is\ninadequate to sustain a summary dismissal of the petition for DNA analysis. The trial court,\nhowever, did not in any way address this issue. The court summarily dismissed the petition on other\ngrounds, to which we now turn.\n\n                As we previously framed it, the third issue is whether, as a matter of law, the\n\u201cconsensual sex defense\u201d that the petitioner pursued at trial defeats the need for testing. The trial\ncourt opined that this theory of defense was fatal to the petition inasmuch as it defeated the statutory\nrequirement that a \u201creasonable probability exists that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted\nor convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA analysis.\u201d See Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a7 40-30-304(1) (2003). We disagree.2\n\n                Unlike statutory schemes in other jurisdictions, Tennessee\u2019s Post-Conviction DNA\nAnalysis Act of 2001 does not explicitly require that the petitioner show that identity was an issue\nat trial. See William D. Buford, slip op. at 4; Willie Tom Ensley, slip op. at 2-3. Also, trial courts\nin Tennessee \u201cmay\u201d order testing even if DNA analysis would have produced only a more favorable\nverdict or a more favorable sentence. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-305(1) (2003); see William D.\nBuford, slip op. at 4; Willie Tom Ensley, slip op. at 2-3.\n\n                The recent decision in Jack Jay Shuttle v. State, No. E2003-00131-CCA-R3-PC\n(Tenn. Crim. App., Knoxville, Feb. 3, 2004), applic. perm. app. filed (Tenn. Apr. 2, 2004), supports\nthe view that the theory of defense pursued at trial does not necessarily control the outcome of a\npetition for DNA testing. The petitioner in Shuttle had been convicted of first-degree murder, and\nafter pursing post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel, he filed a petition\nrequesting that blood underneath the victim\u2019s fingernails and blood on his jeans be subjected to DNA\nanalysis. Jack Jay Shuttle, slip op. at 1-2. The lower court denied the petition, but that ruling was\nreversed on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n             This court\u2019s earlier opinion addressed the petitioner\u2019s bid for post-conviction relief based on a claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel. The lower court had dismissed the post-conviction petition, and the dismissal was\naffirmed on appeal. One of the petitioner\u2019s complaints against trial counsel related to the absence of DNA testing. The\npetitioner claimed that counsel was ineffective for not obtaining DNA testing and that counsel failed to cross-examine\nthe state\u2019s expert about the inconclusive results of forensic tests that were performed and how DNA testing would have\nincluded or excluded the petitioner as the source of the semen. Steven Craig Griffin, No. 01C01-9801-CC-00004, slip\nop. at 4. In rejecting the complaint, this court stated that DNA evidence was irrelevant to the consensual sex defense\noffered by the petitioner and that the proposed course of cross-examination would not advance the consent defense. Id.,\nslip op. at 4-5. W e note that the petitioner\u2019s complaint about counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness did not impugn the theory of\ndefense pursued at trial.\n\n\n\n                                                         -6-\n\f                One of the issues in Shuttle was whether the petitioner\u2019s testimony at trial that he\nkilled the victim defeated his bid for DNA testing in view of the requirement that he show a\nreasonable probability that he would not have been prosecuted or convicted had exculpatory DNA\nevidence been obtained. The Shuttle court did not find the trial testimony to be dispositive because\nthe Act was created with wrongfully convicted or sentenced defendants in mind. See id., slip op. at\n6.\n\n                 In the course of its ruling, the Shuttle court factually distinguished an earlier decision\nin Carl E. Saine v. State, No. W2002-03006-CCA-R3-PC (Tenn. Crim. App., Jackson, Dec. 15,\n2003), perm. app. denied (Tenn. 2004). Saine involved a petitioner convicted of assault and rape\nwho later petitioned to secure DNA testing of spermatozoa discovered on the victim\u2019s torn panties.\nThe petitioner had confessed to assaulting the victim but claimed that the victim was unconscious\nwhen he left and that someone else could have entered the room and raped the victim without her\nknowledge. Carl E. Saine, slip op. at 3, 5. The court affirmed the denial of the petition for DNA\nanalysis because, inter alia, the evidence that Saine wanted tested could not be directly linked to the\nrape. See id., slip op. at 5-6.\n\n                Consequently, for the foregoing reasons, we do not view the theory of defense\npursued at trial as automatically controlling the outcome of a petition for DNA testing, nor do we\nregard this court\u2019s earlier opinion addressing counsel\u2019s effectiveness as dispositive of the different\nissue now before us. The trial court, as a result, erred in summarily denying the request for DNA\nanalysis as barred by the sexual consent defense at trial.\n\n                 The last issue requires us to determine if the petitioner knowingly waived DNA\ntesting in earlier proceedings. To address the issue, we have consulted the court record in the earlier\npost-conviction proceeding. See Delbridge v. State, 742 S.W.2d 266, 267 (Tenn. 1987) (\u201c[C]ourts\nmay take judicial notice of . . . court records in an earlier proceeding of the same case and the actions\nof the courts thereon.\u201d).\n\n                From the evidentiary hearing on the post-conviction petition, we glean that the\npetitioner was extradited from Florida to Tennessee in June 1993. The petitioner demanded trial\nwithin 180 days pursuant to the Interstate Compact on Detainers, see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-31-101\net seq. (2003), and his trial commenced in September. While the case was underway, information\ncame to light that certain jurors had acquired independent knowledge of the petitioner\u2019s prior\nconvictions, prompting the trial court to declare a mistrial. The case was rescheduled and tried in\nOctober 1993, also within the 180-day window, at which time the petitioner was convicted. Because\nthe petitioner had demanded trial within 180 days of extradition, DNA testing could not have been\ncompleted before either trial.\n\n               The theory of defense at the first trial was reasonable doubt. Trial counsel explained\nat the post-conviction hearing that a pivotal witness for the state was unavailable for the first trial.\nWithout this witness, the state\u2019s ability to prove identity was thrown into doubt, thereby favoring a\nmistaken identity/reasonable doubt line of defense. After the mistrial, however, the state located the\n\n\n                                                   -7-\n\fwitness, which prompted counsel at the second trial to shift to a defense theory that the victim had\nconsented to the sexual encounter. The petitioner did not testify at the second trial.\n\n                At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner acknowledged the shift in defense\ntheories between the first and second trials, but he testified that the change in defenses \u201cisn\u2019t an issue\nI presented in my post-conviction.\u201d He also testified that, in terms of the offenses, he told counsel\nhe could not remember what had happened and was under the influence of alcohol. Likewise,\ncounsel testified that the petitioner related that he remembered being in the area and drinking\nheavily, after which he had no memory of events later that night.\n\n                From the testimony presented, the post-conviction court concluded,\n\n                [T]here wasn\u2019t time for the DNA testing to be conducted . . . if the --\n                uh -- trial was to take place within the time frame that the defendant\n                insisted upon. It was his right to insist upon that; but, it\u2019s kind of --\n                uh -- you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it, too, type situation. And, he\n                opted for the quick trial in this situation.\n\n                 In our opinion, the petitioner\u2019s earlier failure to pursue DNA analysis was a deliberate\nand knowing bypass of that avenue of investigation, which constitutes waiver in the context of this\ncollateral action. In general, the client has exclusive authority to make decisions that are binding\nupon the attorney within the framework of the law. See Zagorski v. State, 983 S.W.2d 654, 658\n(Tenn. 1998). In this case, the petitioner\u2019s desire for an early trial date was paramount, and he was\nwilling to forego a legally available objective to secure a speedy trial. If, as in this case, a competent\npetitioner knowingly and voluntarily chooses a lawful course of action or defense strategy and if the\npetitioner is thereby prejudiced by his own decision, he should not later be heard to complain.\n\n                To be sure, the statutory sections of the Post-Conviction DNA Analysis Act of 2001\ndo not explicitly mention \u201cwaiver.\u201d Nonetheless, one of the express qualifying criteria that must be\nmet to obtain DNA analysis is a showing that \u201c[t]he application for analysis is made for the purpose\nof demonstrating innocence and not to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or\nadministration of justice.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-304(4) (2003). The concern expressed in that\nqualifying criteria mirrors one of the often cited considerations for waiver: that is, finality. See\nHouse v. State, 911 S.W.2d 705, 714 (Tenn. 1995). \u201c[T]here must be a finality to all litigation,\ncriminal as well as civil.\u201d Arthur v. State, 483 S.W.2d 95, 97 (Tenn. 1972).\n\n                The facts surrounding the petitioner\u2019s conviction demonstrate that the failure to\npursue DNA testing at the pretrial stage of the prosecution was a calculated decision. That decision,\nmoreover, was unrelated to the theory of defense. For the first trial, an identity/reasonable doubt\ndefense was pursued; for the second trial, consent was the theory of defense. In neither scenario did\nthe petitioner pursue available, scientific DNA analysis. His evident concern was a speedy trial; that\nstrategy might have carried the day in the first trial had a mistrial not been required, considering the\nunavailability of a key witness for the state. That said, in our opinion it behooved the petitioner to\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fshow in his application for DNA testing why his present request would \u201cnot unreasonably delay the\nexecution of sentence or administration of justice.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-304(4) (2003); see\nSedley Alley v. State, No. W2004-01204-CCA-R3-PC (Tenn. Crim. App., Jackson, May 26, 2004)\n(noting that the post-conviction court expressed having \u201cserious questions regarding the motivations\nof the petitioner for raising this issue at this time\u201d in terms of statutory requirement that petition for\nDNA analysis must be brought for purpose of demonstrating innocence and not to unreasonably\ndelay execution of sentence or administration of justice). That showing was not made, for which the\ntrial court was authorized to dismiss the request for DNA analysis. See William D. Buford, slip op.\nat 7 (if apparent that any of the qualifying criteria cannot be established, trial court has authority to\ndismiss petition); see also Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a) (\u201cNothing in this rule shall be construed as\nrequiring relief be granted to a party responsible for an error or who failed to take whatever action\nwas reasonably available to prevent or nullify the harmful effect of an error.\u201d).\n\n                 In summary, we conclude that the trial court should not have treated the request for\nDNA analysis as a petition to reopen the earlier post-conviction proceeding. We further conclude\nthat the state\u2019s response was inadequate to explain why it could not produce the requested evidence\nand, therefore, could not supply grounds to summarily dismiss the petitioner\u2019s request. Moreover,\nwe conclude that the \u201cconsensual sex\u201d theory of defense did not, as a matter of law, defeat the\nrequest for DNA analysis. Finally, however, we hold that the application was properly dismissed\nfor failure to satisfy the statutory condition that \u201c[t]he application for analysis is made for the\npurpose of demonstrating innocence and not to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or\nadministration of justice.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-304(4) (2003), and for that reason we affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                __________________________________________\n                                                JAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -9-\n\f",
