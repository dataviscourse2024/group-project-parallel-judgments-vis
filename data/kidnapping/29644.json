Wiley appeals his conviction for unlawful use of a weapon in violation of \u00a7 571.030, RSMo 19941 for attempted kidnapping in violation of \u00a7 564.011, and for armed criminal action under \u00a7 571.015, for which he was sentenced to one year, two years and five years, respectively. Having carefully considered the contentions on appeal, we conclude the judgment should be affirmed. A published opinion would lack precedential value. A memorandum as to the reasons for our decision has been furnished to the parties. Rule 30.25(b).\n\n. All statutory references are to Revised Statutes of Missouri 1994, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n",
