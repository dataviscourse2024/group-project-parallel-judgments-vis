Appellants filed a\nmotion to dismiss these claims under the Texas Citizen\u2019s Participation Act\n\f(TCPA),1 and the trial court denied it. They challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling in\nthis interlocutory appeal. We affirm the trial court\u2019s order in part, reverse it in\npart, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                               I.     TCPA PROCEDURES\n\n       The TCPA was designed to protect a defendant\u2019s rights of speech, petition,\nand association while protecting a claimant\u2019s right to pursue valid legal claims for\ninjuries caused by the defendant. Montelongo v. Abrea, 622 S.W.3d 290, 295\n(Tex. 2021) (citing Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 27.002). To accomplish this\nobjective, the TCPA provides for a multi-step process for the dismissal of a legal\naction to which it applies. See id. First, the movant must demonstrate that the\nlegal action is \u201cbased on or is in response to\u201d the movant\u2019s exercise of the right of\nfree speech, petition, or association. Id. If the movant meets this burden, the\nclaimant may avoid dismissal by establishing by clear and specific evidence a\nprima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question. Id. Under this\nstandard, the claimant must provide enough detail to show the factual basis for\ntheir claim. In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 590 (Tex. 2015) (orig. proceeding).\n\n       An \u201cexercise of the right to petition\u201d means, among other things, (1) a\ncommunication pertaining to an official proceeding to administer the law, or (2) a\ncommunication that is reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an\nissue by a judicial or other governmental body. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\u00a7 27.001(4)(A)(ii), (C).      An \u201cexercise of the right of free speech\u201d means a\ncommunication made in connection with a matter of public concern.                        Id.\n\u00a7 27.001(3).    A \u201cmatter of public concern\u201d includes a statement or activity\n\n\n\n       1\n         See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code ch. 27; see also In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 584 &\nn.1 (Tex. 2015).\n\n                                             2\n\fregarding \u201ca matter of political, social, or other interest to the community\u201d or \u201ca\nsubject of concern to the public.\u201d Id. \u00a7 27.001(7).\n\n      We review de novo whether the parties have met their respective burdens.\nSee M.A. Mills, P.C. v. Kotts, 640 S.W.3d 323, 326 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th\nDist.] 2022, pet. filed). We view the pleadings and the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the claimant, favoring the conclusion that their claims are not\npredicated on a protected expression. See Buzbee v. Clear Channel Outdoor, LLC,\n616 S.W.3d 14, 29 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, no pet.); Sanchez v.\nStriever, 614 S.W.3d 233, 246 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, no pet.).\n\n                         II.   PLEADINGS AND EVIDENCE\n\n      Li sued appellants for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment,\ndefamation, negligence, and gross negligence.         She alleged that she was a\ncosmetics salesperson at a Saks department store.        Regarding her malicious\nprosecution claim, she alleged that appellants accused her of committing aggregate\nfelony theft, and Li was arrested based on appellants\u2019 accusation. The basis for the\ntheft accusation was that Li made sales to customers who used other peoples\u2019\ncredit cards. Regarding her defamation claim, she alleged that Saks, Dominguez,\nand Balogh \u201cmade false, defamatory statements accusing [Li] of a crime\u2014namely\ntheft\u2014and published the false statements to third parties including police officers,\nother employees who were not directly involved in the investigation, and [Li\u2019s]\nfriends.\u201d\n\n      Appellants filed a motion to dismiss under the TCPA, arguing that Li\u2019s\nclaims were based on appellants\u2019 exercise of the right to petition. Appellants\nargued that they established the affirmative defense of truth for Li\u2019s defamation\nclaim, attaching as an exhibit Li\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d to the alleged offense. In the\nstatement handwritten by Welch or Dominguez, but signed by Li, she admitted to\n                                          3\n\fringing up several transactions for customers who purportedly used their \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d\naccounts and had other people pick up the orders. The statement provides, \u201cI knew\nthat the Saks account numbers used did not belong to the customers I was talking\nto,\u201d and, \u201cI knew that this was wrong and I know this caused an additional loss to\nthe company.\u201d\n\n      Li filed an amended petition in which she altered the basis for her\ndefamation claim. Instead of complaining about statements made to the police or\nother employees, Li alleged that Saks, Dominguez, and Balogh \u201cthrough\nDominguez, made false, defamatory statements accusing [Li] of a crime\u2014namely\ntheft\u2014and published the false statements to a third party who was [Li\u2019s]\nacquaintance.\u201d\n\n      Li filed a response to appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, attaching declarations\nfrom herself, her friend, and her criminal defense attorney. In her declaration, Li\ntestified that she was a lawful permanent resident from China and was hired by\nSaks \u201cbecause I was Chinese and I spoke Chinese and had access to lots of wealthy\nChinese customers.\u201d She testified that Saks \u201cgave me permission and encouraged\nme to promote Saks merchandise on a Chinese app called WeChat that is very\nmuch like Facebook.\u201d Li sold millions of dollars\u2019 worth of different products for\nSaks during her two and a half years\u2019 employment at the department store.\n\n      In April 2019, Welch and Dominguez were employed by Saks as loss\nprevention officers. They had been investigating some bad credit card transactions\ninvolving Li\u2019s customers when they called Li to an office and interrogated her for\nhours without allowing her to leave or use the bathroom. Li testified that she does\nnot speak English well and does not understand complicated words in English.\nShe could not communicate in English well enough to explain things to Welch and\nDominguez as they accused her of being a thief. Welch and Dominguez \u201cknew\n\n                                        4\n\f[Li] could not understand good or explain things well to them and took advantage\nof it.\u201d They wrote out the purported confession in English and made Li sign it. Li\ndid not understand what it said and felt she could not go home or keep her job if\nshe did not sign it. She testified that she did not accept credit card payments that\nshe knew were unauthorized.\n\n      The store manager, Balogh, read the statement and authorized Welch and\nDominguez to seek Li\u2019s arrest. Li was arrested at the store and held for three days\nin a Harris County jail. Li\u2019s criminal defense attorney testified that a criminal\ncomplaint alleged that Li unlawfully appropriated various items of merchandise\nfrom Welch, i.e., Saks, with the intent to deprive Welch of the property.\nUltimately, a grand jury no-billed the case, and the charge was dismissed.\n\n      Li testified that that credit card transactions that formed the basis of her\narrest for theft \u201chad to be approved through Saks\u2019 credit department,\u201d and Saks\n\u201capproved each transaction that Saks accused me of doing something wrong with.\u201d\nLi \u201cfollowed the procedures that Saks told me to follow.\u201d She testified that Welch\nand Dominguez never told the police that the credit department authorized the\ntransactions that Li did for the customers who participated in the alleged theft.\nWelch and Dominguez \u201cnever told police that I ran those transactions by the Saks\ncredit department for approval.\u201d Li\u2019s attorney testified that Li\u2019s lack of intent to\nsteal merchandize was shown by the fact that Li was required to \u201cget approval\nfrom the credit department for all in-store purchases over $1,000\u201d and that Li\n\u201ccomplied with company policy before each transaction and did not make any\nattempt to subvert or hide what she was doing.\u201d Moreover, Welch and Dominguez\nnever told the police that \u201cSaks encouraged employees to use WeChat.\u201d\n\n      Li testified that when she was being detained at the Saks store, Welch and\nDominguez took Li\u2019s briefcase that contained $150 in cash, which belonged to Li\u2019s\n\n                                         5\n\ffriend. Li and the friend testified similarly that when the friend went to Saks to get\nthe money, Dominguez told the friend that Dominguez \u201cdidn\u2019t see any money\u201d and\nthat \u201cthe money was stolen by [Li].\u201d\n\n      At the hearing on appellants\u2019 motion, appellants additionally contended that\nthe TCPA applied to Li\u2019s amended defamation claim because it related to a matter\nof public concern.\n\n      The trial court denied the motion without specifying its reasons.\n\n                                 III.   TIMELINESS\n\n      As an initial matter, Li contends that the trial court\u2019s order may be upheld\nfor Saks and Welch because they did not file their motion to dismiss timely under\nthe TCPA.\n\n      A motion to dismiss under the TCPA \u201cmust be filed not later than the 60th\nday after the date of service of the legal action.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\u00a7 27.003(b). The parties, \u201cunder mutual agreement, may extend the time to file a\nmotion.\u201d Id. And, the court \u201cmay extend the time to file a motion under this\nsection on a showing of good cause.\u201d Id. Although the statute does not define\n\u201cgood cause,\u201d at least one court has noted that good cause may be established by\nshowing that \u201cthe failure involved was an accident or mistake, not intentional or\nthe result of conscious indifference.\u201d Sullo v. Kubosh, 616 S.W.3d 869, 900 n.1\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2020, no pet.) (quoting Wheeler v. Green, 157\nS.W.3d 439, 442 (Tex. 2005) (per curiam)).\n\n      Saks and Welch filed their motion to dismiss on November 30, 2020. Li\nadduced evidence that Saks and Welch were served on September 16 and\nSeptember 8, 2020, respectively\u2014more than sixty days before they filed their\nmotion. However, Li also adduced evidence that the parties signed a Rule 11\n\n                                          6\n\fagreement whereby the defendants agreed to \u201caccept service of Plaintiff\u2019s Original\nPetition\u201d on October 1, 2020.\n\n         Saks and Welch argued to the trial court and to this court that the Rule 11\nagreement set the date of service as October 1, so their November 30 motion was\nfiled timely within sixty days of service. They contend in the alternative that they\nestablished good cause for a late filing by relying on the date of service stated in\nthe Rule 11 agreement. Yi makes no argument regarding Saks and Welch\u2019s good\ncause.\n\n         Even if the Rule 11 agreement in this case did not set the date of service for\npurposes of the TCPA,2 Saks and Welch\u2019s reliance on the date of the Rule 11\nagreement in filing their motion to dismiss establishes good cause because their\nfailure to file the motion a few weeks earlier was the result of a mistake and not\nconscious indifference. Compare Sullo, 616 S.W.3d at 902 (no good cause when\nthe movants filed their TCPA motion \u201cyears after they were served with a legal\naction setting out the only causes of action that have been asserted against them\u201d\nand after they had filed dispositive summary judgment motions on those causes of\naction), with Boulet v. State, 189 S.W.3d 833, 837\u201338 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st\nDist.] 2006, no pet.) (good cause established when attorney mis-calendared\ndeadline to respond to request for admissions and the attorney delivered the\nresponse on the perceived deadline).\n\n         The trial court\u2019s ruling on Saks and Welch\u2019s motion cannot be upheld on this\nbasis.\n\n         2\n         Li agrees that Dominguez was served on the date of the Rule 11 agreement because that\nis when Dominguez \u201cagreed to accept service,\u201d but also contends that the Rule 11 agreement was\n\u201cineffective to reset the dates for Saks and Welch because it is unsworn.\u201d See Tex. R. Civ. P.\n119 (stating that a defendant may accept service of process through an attorney by a \u201cwritten\nmemorandum . . . sworn to before a proper officer\u201d).\n\n                                              7\n\f                         IV.   MALICIOUS PROSECUTION\n\n      Regarding Li\u2019s malicious prosecution claim, appellants first contend that the\nTCPA applies because the claim is based on or in response to their exercise of the\nright to petition. Li does not dispute this contention, and we agree with appellants\nthat Li\u2019s claims are based on or in response to appellants\u2019 communications\nreasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a judicial or\nother governmental body. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 27.001(4)(C); see\nalso Ford v. Bland, No. 14-15-00828-CV, 2016 WL 7323309, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014\nHouston [14th Dist.] Dec. 15, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op.) (\u201cStatements to police\nregarding incidences of perceived wrongdoing are protected by the TCPA.\u201d);\naccord Buckingham Senior Living Cmty., Inc. v. Washington, 605 S.W.3d 800, 807\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2020, no pet.); Murphy USA, Inc. v. Rose, No. 12-\n15-00197-CV, 2016 WL 5800263, at *3\u20134 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler Oct. 5, 2016, no\npet.) (mem. op.).\n\n      We turn to the second step of the TCPA analysis. As part of her burden to\nproduce clear and specific evidence of a prima facie case for each essential element\nof the malicious prosecution claim, Li had to prove among other things that\nappellants (1) lacked probable cause; and (2) harbored malice toward her. See\nKroger Tex. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Suberu, 216 S.W.3d 788, 792\u201393 (Tex. 2006).\nAppellants contend that Li has failed to meet her burden to prove these two\nelements. We address only the probable cause element because it is dispositive.\n\n      The probable cause element asks \u201cwhether a reasonable person would\nbelieve that a crime had been committed given the facts as the complainant\nhonestly and reasonably believed them to be before the criminal proceedings were\ninstituted.\u201d Id. (quoting Richey v. Brookshire Grocery Co., 952 S.W.2d 515, 517\n(Tex. 1997)).   Courts presume that a complainant acted reasonably and had\n\n                                         8\n\fprobable cause to initiate criminal proceedings.       Id. at 793.    \u201cTo rebut this\npresumption, the plaintiff must produce evidence that the motives, grounds,\nbeliefs, or other information upon which the [complainant] acted did not constitute\nprobable cause.\u201d Id. The complainant\u2019s \u201cfailure to make a further investigation\ninto the suspect\u2019s state of mind does not constitute lack of probable cause if all\nobjective elements of a crime reasonably appear to have been completed.\u201d Richey,\n952 S.W.2d at 518. In other words, the complainant has no duty to inquire of the\nsuspect whether they have some alibi or explanation for their conduct. Id.\n\n      A person commits the offense of theft if the person unlawfully appropriates\nproperty with intent to deprive the owner of the property. Tex. Penal Code.\n\u00a7 31.03(a). \u201cAppropriate\u201d means to acquire or otherwise exercise control over\nproperty. Id. \u00a7 31.01(4)(B). Appropriation is unlawful if it is without the owner\u2019s\neffective consent. Id. \u00a7 31.03(b)(1). Consent is not effective if it is induced by\ndeception. Id. \u00a7 31.01(3)(A). A person may be held criminally responsible for the\nconduct of another if, acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the\noffense, the person solicits, encourages, aids, or attempts to aid the other person to\ncommit the offense. Id. \u00a7 7.02(a)(2).\n\n      Under these standards, Li had the burden to respond to appellants\u2019 motion\nwith clear and specific evidence showing that appellants acted on motives,\ngrounds, beliefs, or other information such that a reasonable person would not have\nbelieved Li committed theft.\n\n      Here, appellants knew that Li had facilitated fraudulent sales and admitted\nthat she \u201cknew that this was wrong.\u201d           None of Li\u2019s evidence rebuts the\npresumption that appellants reasonably believed Li had committed theft.            Li\nsuggests that appellants \u201cdrew an unsupported assumption that the credit account\nholder had not authorized the caller to use their credit account.\u201d         But these\n\n                                          9\n\ftransactions were deemed fraudulent and resulted in a loss to Saks; no evidence\nundermines appellants\u2019 belief that the account holders did not authorize the\ntransactions. Li also contends that appellants knew that the \u201ccredit department\u201d\nauthorized the transactions, but she adduced no evidence of any appellants\u2019\nknowledge of this fact\u2014she testified only that Welch and Dominguez failed to\ninform the police about this fact.\n\n      Li points to other evidence purportedly undermining her intent to commit a\ntheft: the coercive nature of the interrogation, her poor understanding of the\nEnglish language, her \u201cmodel employment history,\u201d and her attorney\u2019s opinion\ntestimony. None of this evidence undermines appellants\u2019 reasonable belief that Li\nunlawfully appropriated Saks\u2019 property with an intent to deprive Saks of the\nproperty. See Suberu, 216 S.W.3d at 794 (plaintiff\u2019s testimony that she didn\u2019t have\na cart when leaving the store did not undermine employees\u2019 reasonable beliefs that\nthe plaintiff was trying to leave the store with a cart of items); Richey, 952 S.W.2d\nat 518 (reasoning that the defendant could presume the plaintiff\u2019s intent to steal\nbased on his conduct of leaving the store without paying for an item concealed in\nhis possession); Cash Am. Pawn, LP v. Alonzo, No. 01-19-00801-CV, 2021 WL\n4155795, at *1\u20132, *7\u20138 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Sept. 14, 2021, no pet.)\n(mem. op.) (reasoning that the defendant\u2013employer could reasonably believe that\nthe plaintiff\u2013employee committed theft when the plaintiff executed loans to\nanother employee that were well above the resale value of the collateral, even\nthough no money or property left the store). Similarly, Welch and Dominguez\u2019s\nfailure to disclose to the police that Saks encouraged Li to use WeChat or that the\nSaks credit department had approved the transactions does not rebut the\npresumption of probable cause. See Richey, 952 S.W.2d at 519 (reasoning that a\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cfailing to fully and fairly disclose all material information and\n\n\n                                         10\n\fknowingly providing false information to the prosecutor . . . have no bearing on\nprobable cause\u201d).\n\n      In sum, Li failed to meet her burden in response to the TCPA motion to\nproduce evidence showing that a reasonable person in appellants\u2019 position would\nnot have believed Li committed theft because Li did not adduce any evidence\nconcerning the \u201cmotives, grounds, beliefs, or other information upon which\n[appellants] acted\u201d that would not amount to probable cause. Suberu, 216 S.W.3d\nat 793\u201394.\n\n      The trial court erred by not dismissing Li\u2019s malicious prosecution claim\nunder the TCPA.\n\n                                V.     DEFAMATION\n\n      Appellants challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of their TCPA motion as it\nrelates to the defamation claim in Li\u2019s original petition (based on an allegation of\ntheft made to police and other employees) and the defamation claim in her\namended petition (based on an allegation of theft made to Li\u2019s friend).\n\n      The elements of defamation include (1) the publication of a false statement\nof fact to a third party, (2) that was defamatory concerning the plaintiff, (3) made\nwith the requisite degree of fault, and (4) damages in some cases. In re Lipsky, 460\nS.W.3d 579, 593 (Tex. 2015) (orig. proceeding). Generally, the status of the\nplaintiff determines the requisite degree of fault, and a private individual need only\nprove negligence. See id. But even a private individual must prove actual malice\nif the circumstances support the application of a qualified privilege. Steinhaus v.\nBeachside Env\u2019t, LLC, 590 S.W.3d 672, 677 (Tex.

Original Petition Defamation Claim\n\n      Appellants contend that the TCPA applies to Li\u2019s original defamation claim\nand that Li failed to produce clear and specific evidence of each essential element\nof her claim\u2014in particular, proof of actual malice because a qualified privilege\napplies. We agree with appellants.\n\n      1.     Survival of TCPA Motion Following Amendment of Petition\n\n      As an initial matter, Li contends that appellants \u201cimproperly challenge the\ntrial court\u2019s order pertaining to Li\u2019s defamation claim with respect to statements\nmade to the police and employees\u201d because \u201cLi chose not to advance\u201d this claim in\nher amended petition.     Li contends that appellant\u2019s argument is \u201cmisplaced\u201d\nbecause Li\u2019s amended petition took the place of her original petition.\n\n      \u201cA party\u2019s decision to nonsuit does not affect a nonmoving party\u2019s\nindependent claims for affirmative relief, including motions for dismissal under the\nTCPA.\u201d Abatecola v. 2 Savages Concrete Plumbing, LLC, No. 14-17-00678-CV.\n2018 WL 3118601, at *13 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] June 26, 2018, pet.\ndenied) (mem. op.). \u201cTCPA motions to dismiss survive nonsuit because, unlike a\nnonsuit, the TCPA motion to dismiss might also allow the movant to obtain a\ndismissal with prejudice, attorney\u2019s fees, and sanctions.\u201d Id. at *14. Thus, we\nmust consider Li\u2019s defamation claim as pleaded at the time appellants filed their\nTCPA motion. See Reeves v. Harbor Am. Cent., Inc., 631 S.W.3d 299, 308 n.7\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, pet. denied).\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      2.     Claim Based on or in Response to Right to Petition\n\n      As with the malicious prosecution claim, appellants contend that Li\u2019s\noriginal defamation claim was based on or in response to Saks\u2019s, Dominguez\u2019s,\nand Balogh\u2019s exercise of the right to petition. Li does not dispute this contention.\nWe agree with appellants that the statements to police and others about Li\u2019s alleged\ntheft from Saks were communications pertaining to an official proceeding to\nadminister the law or were reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review\nof an issue by a judicial or other governmental body. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode \u00a7 27.001(4)(A)(ii), (C); see also Ford v. Bland, No. 14-15-00828-CV, 2016\nWL 7323309, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 15, 2016, no pet.)\n(mem. op.) (defamation claim based on statements to police were based on, related\nto, or in response to exercise of right to petition).\n\n      3.     Qualified Privilege and No Evidence of Actual Malice\n\n      Appellants contend that Saks\u2019s, Dominguez\u2019s and Balogh\u2019s statements to\npolice and any other employees were qualifiedly privileged, and thus, Li had the\nburden to adduce clear and specific evidence that these appellants made their\ndefamatory statements with actual malice. In her briefing, Li does not dispute the\napplicability of the privilege and \u201cassumes that Saks, Dominguez, and Balogh had\na qualified privilege.\u201d\n\n      A qualified privilege\u2014sometimes called a \u201cconditional\u201d privilege\u2014arises\nout of the occasion upon which the false statement is published. Shell Oil Co. v.\nWritt, 464 S.W.3d 650, 654 (Tex. 2015). Circumstances that may give rise to a\nqualified privilege include those that induce a belief that the publication protects\nthe publisher\u2019s interest. See Granada Biosciences, Inc. v. Forbes, Inc., 49 S.W.3d\n610, 619 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2001), rev\u2019d on other grounds, Forbes,\nInc. v. Granada Biosciences, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 167 (Tex. 2003); see also Cain v.\n                                            13\n\fHearst Corp., 878 S.W.2d 577, 582 (Tex. 1994) (qualified privilege exists when\nthe speaker has \u201can interest that is sufficiently affected by the communication\u201d).\nGenerally, \u201can employer has a conditional or qualified privilege that attaches to\ncommunications made in the course of an investigation following a report of\nemployee wrongdoing.\u201d Randall\u2019s Food Markets, Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d\n640, 646 (Tex. 1995). Another circumstance generally giving rise to a qualified\nprivilege is \u201cwhen a person makes a statement to police identifying someone as a\npotential suspect in the commission of a criminal offense.\u201d Pease v. Bembry, No.\n03-02-00640-CV, 2004 WL 1574243, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin July 15, 2004, no\npet.) (mem. op.); accord Robert B. James, DDS, Inc. v. Elkins, 553 S.W.3d 596,\n610 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2018, pet. denied).\n\n      Here, appellants established that Saks\u2019s, Dominguez\u2019s, and Balogh\u2019s\nstatements concerning Li\u2019s alleged theft from Saks were qualifiedly privileged.\nSee Randalls, 891 S.W.2d at 646; Pease, 2004 WL 1574243, at *2. Thus, it\nbecame Li\u2019s burden to establish by clear and specific evidence that these appellants\nmade the statements with actual malice\u2014with knowledge of falsity or reckless\ndisregard for the truth. See Steinhaus, 590 S.W.3d at 677\u201378.\n\n      Li points to evidence showing that she did not write the confession, did not\nunderstand it, and only signed it after a coercive interrogation by Welch and\nDominguez. She again points to evidence that she \u201cgot approval for the alleged\nfraudulent transactions from Saks\u2019 credit department,\u201d that she was a successful\nemployee, and that she was encouraged by Saks to use WeChat to sell Saks\u2019s\nmerchandise. But, none of this evidence shows that Saks, Dominguez, and Balogh\nspoke with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth when they\ncommunicated with the police or other employees. At the time they made their\nstatements, they knew that Li had facilitated fraudulent transactions by allowing\n\n                                        14\n\fcustomers to use credit cards belonging to other people and that Li admitted, \u201cI\nknew that this was wrong.\u201d\n\n      Although Li\u2019s evidence tends to prove the falsity of these appellants\u2019\nstatements, the falsity of the statements does not prove actual malice. See id. at\n679. These appellants\u2019 failures to investigate the facts more fully before referring\nthe matter to the police is not evidence of actual malice. See Bentley v. Bunton, 94\nS.W.3d 561, 596 (Tex. 2002). Li\u2019s evidence does not show that these appellants\npurposefully avoided the truth or that their assertions were inherently improbable\nand made on information that was obviously dubious. See id.; cf. Steinhaus, 590\nS.W.3d at 679 (reasoning that the plaintiff\u2019s self-serving denial of improper\nactivity made to the defendant did not show that the defendant spoke with\nknowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth (citing Huckabee v. Time\nWarner Entm\u2019t Co., 19 S.W.3d 413, 427 (Tex. 2000))). At most, Li\u2019s evidence\nshows that these appellants misinterpreted ambiguous facts, which does not show\nactual malice. See Bentley, 94 S.W.3d at 596.\n\n      Accordingly, the trial court erred by not dismissing Li\u2019s original defamation\nclaim under the TCPA.\n\nB.    Amended Petition Claim\n\n      Appellants contend that the TCPA applies to Li\u2019s amended defamation claim\nbecause it \u201cconcerned Dominguez\u2019s right to speak regarding an issue of public\nconcern\u2014i.e., Li\u2019s alleged commission of a crime.\u201d As shown by Li\u2019s amended\npetition and evidence, the basis for this claim was Dominguez\u2019s communication to\nLi\u2019s friend that Li stole $150 from Li\u2019s friend\n\n      To determine whether speech relates to a matter of public concern, courts\nconsider the content, form, and context of the speech. Brady v. Klentzman, 515\n\n\n                                          15\n\fS.W.3d 878, 884 (Tex. 2017); Moore v. Reed, No. 14-20-00463-CV, 2022 WL\n1180116, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] Apr. 21, 2022, no pet.) (mem.\nop.). Yet, appellants appear to argue that any statement about the commission of a\ncrime is about a matter of public concern, citing Brady, 515 S.W.3d at 884. This\nproposition is dubious.\n\n      In Brady, the Supreme Court of Texas noted, \u201cPublic matters include,\namong other things, \u2018commission of crime, prosecutions resulting from it, and\njudicial proceedings arising from the prosecutions.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 492 (1975)).         Brady involved statements by a\nreporter made in a newspaper article about how a chief of police intimidated\nofficers who ticketed the plaintiff, i.e., the chief\u2019s son. Id. The supreme court held\nthat the article was about a matter of public concern because there was a\nparamount public interest in a free flow of information to the people concerning\npublic officials such as the chief of police. Id. The court did not end the inquiry at\nthe mere fact that the article was about the plaintiff\u2019s commission of a crime.\n\n      The Cox Broadcasting case, quoted in Brady, prohibited the press from\nbeing sued for invasion of privacy based on reporting of judicial proceedings and\ninformation that was already in the public record\u2014there, the name of a rape\nvictim.   See Cox Broad., 420 U.S. at 492, 494\u201395, 498\u201397 (\u201cUnder these\ncircumstances, the protection of freedom of the press provided by the First and\nFourteenth Amendments bars the State[s] from making appellants\u2019 broadcast the\nbasis of civil liability.\u201d). The Supreme Court did not end the inquiry with the fact\nthat the subject matter of the report concerned crime.\n\n      This court took a similar approach in Moore, in which a candidate for\npolitical office accused her opponent of \u201cbeating his ex-wife.\u201d See 2022 WL\n1180116, at *1. This court did not end the inquiry at the fact that the statements\n\n                                         16\n\fconcerned a crime but instead focused on the content, form, and context of the\nspeech\u2014the statements were made during a political campaign and involved a\ncandidate\u2019s fitness for office.        See id. at *2 (\u201cBased on the context of the\nstatements, we conclude that they were made in connection with a matter of public\nconcern.\u201d).\n\n       Appellants also rely on two decisions from our sister courts: Kadow v.\nGrauerholz, No. 02-20-00044-CV, 2021 WL 733302 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth Feb.\n25, 2021, no pet.), and Crews v. Galvan, No. 13-19-00110-CV, 2019 WL 5076516\n(Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburgh Oct. 10, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op.).\nKadow involved a statement about the plaintiff being \u201cunder criminal\ninvestigation\u201d for theft, fraud, misappropriation, abuse of the elderly, and\nkidnapping. Kadow, 2021 WL 733302, at *3. Crews involved an allegation that a\npastor had sexually assaulted a teenage girl at his prior church. See id. at *2, *4.\nThe defendant informed the plaintiff\u2019s new church and his children\u2019s school about\nthe allegation of sexual assault because the plaintiff was around teenage girls at\nthese locations; the defendant expressed concern that the plaintiff might pose a\ndanger to other young women. See id. at *5 & n.5. The court held that the\nclergyman\u2019s sexual assault of young vulnerable people was a matter of public\nconcern under a prior statutory definition in the TCPA3 even though the statute of\nlimitations had run on the allegation of sexual assault. See id. at *5. The court\nfocused on the particular allegations in the case and did \u201cnot decide whether all\nalleged crimes are matters of public concern in perpetuity.\u201d Id. at *5.\n       3\n          The TCPA was amended in 2019 to alter the definition of \u201cmatter of public concern\u201d so\nthat it more closely tracks the meaning used in First Amendment jurisprudence. See Tex. Civ.\nPrac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 27.001(7)(B). Compare Act of May 21, 2011, 82d Leg., R.S., ch. 341, \u00a7 2,\n2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 961, 962, with Brady, 515 S.W.3d at 884. See generally Creative Oil &\nGas, LLC v. Lona Hills Ranch, LLC, 591 S.W.3d 127, 133\u201334 (Tex. 2019) (noting that the prior\nversion of the TCPA\u2019s definition of \u201cright of free speech\u201d was not fully coextensive with the\nconstitutional meaning).\n\n                                              17\n\f      An accusation that a person has committed a crime does not, standing alone,\nestablish that the speech was on a matter of public concern. See Snead v. Redland\nAggregates Ltd., 998 F.2d 1325, 1328, 1330 (5th Cir. 1993) (statements in a press\nrelease by a party to a lawsuit against two companies, alleging that they committed\ntheft, espionage, and piracy, was not a matter of public concern when considering\nthe content, form, and context of the speech).\n\n      Here, the content, form, and context of Dominguez\u2019s statement do not show\nthat his communication was made in connection with a matter of public concern.\nThere are no allegations or evidence that the statement\u2014that Li stole $150 from\nher friend\u2014was made to anyone other than the alleged victim of the crime or\npublished in a public forum for public consumption. Nor are there allegations or\nevidence that Li was under investigation by a governmental body or under\nindictment for stealing money from Li\u2019s friend. Cf. Miller v. Davis, 653 F. App\u2019x\n448, 460 (6th Cir. 2016) (although the plaintiffs\u2019 reported information \u201cmay have\nonce been private matters, they became public upon issuance of the indictment\nagainst them\u201d); Kadow, 2021 WL 733302, at *3 (allegation about plaintiff being\n\u201cunder investigation\u201d for various crimes was matter of public concern).         The\nstatement concerned only what happened to Li\u2019s friend\u2019s money; the matter was\nnot of general interest or of value or concern to the public.       Cf. Quigley v.\nRosenthal, 327 F.3d 1044, 1059\u201361 (10th Cir. 2003) (recognizing that although an\nallegation of discrimination may be a matter of public concern, here the allegation\nof religious and ethnic discrimination made by a non-media defendant about\nprivate parties, and not involving any concern that members of the public were\nlikely to be harmed or discriminated against, was not a matter of public concern).\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f      Accordingly, appellants did not meet their burden to show that the TCPA\napplies to Li\u2019s amended defamation claim, and the trial court did not err by\ndenying the motion to dismiss this claim.\n\n                               VI.    CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial court erred by not dismissing with prejudice Li\u2019s claims for (1)\nmalicious prosecution against appellants; and (2) defamation against Saks,\nDominguez, and Balogh as pleaded in her original petition. The trial court did not\nerr by denying the motion to dismiss Li\u2019s defamation claim pleaded in her first\namended petition.\n\n      Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss\npertaining to Li\u2019s malicious prosecution and original defamation claim.        The\nremainder of the trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.        We remand the case for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. See Cox Media Grp., LLC v. Joselevitz,\n524 S.W.3d 850, 865 (Tex.
