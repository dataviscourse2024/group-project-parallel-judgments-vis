Cunliffe, Assistant Public Defender, for appellee.\n\n\nEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J.:\n\n                   Plaintiff-appellant, the state of Ohio, appeals from the decision of the\n\nCuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas granting the motion to dismiss filed by\n\fdefendant-appellee Albert Berry based on the state\u2019s failure to commence\n\nprosecution within the applicable statute of limitations. The state contends that the\n\ntrial court erred in dismissing the indictment on statute of limitations grounds\n\nbecause it failed to consider (1) \u201claw enforcement efforts to locate defendant after\n\nthe indictment\u201d was filed and (2) \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct in avoiding apprehension\u201d\n\nin determining whether the prosecution was timely commenced under R.C. 2901.13.\n\n              For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nProcedural History and Factual Background\n\n              On December 30, 2014, a Cuyahoga Grand Jury charged Berry in a\n\nfive-count indictment: two counts of rape (Counts 1 and 2), two counts of attempted\n\nrape (Counts 3 and 4) and one count of kidnapping with a sexual motivation\n\nspecification (Count 5). The charges arose from the alleged sexual assault of S.S. on\n\nJanuary 8, 1995.\n\n              On September 11, 2017, at the conclusion of a bench trial, Berry was\n\nfound guilty of one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c) (Count 1) and\n\none count of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) with a sexual motivation\n\nspecification (Count 5). The trial court granted Berry\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion as to\n\nCounts 2 and 3 and found Berry not guilty of attempted rape as charged in Count 4.\n\nThe rape and kidnapping counts merged for sentencing, and the state elected to have\n\nBerry sentenced on the rape count. Berry was sentenced to three years in prison and\n\nclassified as a sexually oriented offender. The trial court also imposed five years of\n\nmandatory postrelease control.\n\f               Berry appealed, arguing that he was denied effective assistance of\n\ncounsel due to his trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to dismiss based on the\n\nstatute of limitations or preindictment delay. On appeal, this court found that\n\nBerry\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that there was a reasonable\n\nprobability Berry\u2019s case would have been dismissed if his trial counsel had filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment. This court vacated Berry\u2019s convictions and\n\nremanded the case with instructions for the trial court to appoint Berry new counsel\n\nand to allow Berry to file a motion to dismiss the indictment. State v. Berry, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 106415, 2018-Ohio-4855, \u00b6 21.\n\n               The state filed an application for reconsideration and en banc\n\nconsideration pursuant to App.R. 26, arguing that the panel\u2019s decision conflicted\n\nwith other decisions from the district that \u201chave deemed compliance with Crim.R. 4\n\nas satisfying reasonable diligence.\u201d This court denied the state\u2019s application.\n\n               The state appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court. On August 21, 2019,\n\nthe Ohio Supreme Court accepted the state\u2019s jurisdictional appeal. State v. Berry,\n\n2019-Ohio-3263, 129 N.E.3d 470. The proposition of law accepted for review was\n\nwhether \u201c[w]here service of a summons is in compliance with Crim.R. 4(D), a\n\nthreshold showing has been made that reasonable diligence has been made to serve\n\nthe summons.\u201d\n\n               On February 3, 2020, the state filed a motion to dismiss the appeal,\n\nacknowledging that \u201cCrim.R. 4(D)\u2019s provisions on allowing service by commercial\n\ncarrier did not go into effect until July 1, 2018\u201d and that \u201c[t]he fact that the summons\n\fin question was served, in this case, prior to July 1, 2018 undermines the state\u2019s\n\narguments with respect to the proposition of law accepted for review.\u201d            On\n\nFebruary 5, 2020, the Ohio Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s motion and dismissed\n\nthe appeal. State v. Berry, 2020-Ohio-366, 138 N.E.3d 1177.\n\n      Berry\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment\n\n              Berry was assigned new counsel, and on February 19, 2020, he filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that (1) continued prosecution of\n\nthe case violated the applicable statute of limitations and (2) Berry had been subject\n\nto unjustifiable preindictment delay. The state opposed the motion.\n\n              On July 8, 2020, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the\n\nmotion. At the hearing, the state presented testimony from two witnesses: Kenneth\n\nRiolo, an investigator with the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s Sexual Assault\n\nKit Task Force, and Detective Nicholas Riegelmayer, formerly assigned to the\n\nFugitive Task Force for the Warrant Apprehension Unit of the Cuyahoga County\n\nSheriff\u2019s Department (the \u201cfugitive unit\u201d). The parties also introduced transcripts of\n\nthe testimony of several witnesses from the trial. A summary of the relevant\n\nevidence presented at the hearing follows.\n\n      Investigation of the Incident and Prior Arrest\n\n              Three days after the incident, on January 11, 1995, S.S. reported the\n\nincident and went to the hospital, where evidence was collected for a rape kit. Police\n\ninterviewed S.S. regarding the incident the following day. S.S. identified a man \u2014\n\nthen known to her as \u201cDoonti\u201d \u2014 as the perpetrator. Approximately one month\n\flater, \u201cDoonti\u201d ran into S.S.\u2019s apartment in an attempt to hide from police, who were\n\npursuing him in an unrelated matter. When the police arrived at her apartment, S.S.\n\ninformed them that this was the man who had sexually assaulted her a month\n\nearlier. \u201cDoonti\u201d was then identified as Berry, and police arrested him. A police\n\nreport was filed in 1995 naming Berry as a suspect in the sexual assault of S.S.\n\n              At that time, S.S. was \u201ctangled up\u201d in a drug case involving a former\n\nboyfriend, and she informed police that she did not want to pursue charges against\n\nBerry. Berry was released from jail, and no further action was taken in the case until\n\n2012.\n\n              In October 2012, S.S.\u2019s rape kit was submitted for testing. Based on a\n\nCODIS \u201chit,\u201d the DNA profile obtained from testing the rape kit was initially thought\n\nto be a match with a man from Cincinnati. However, it was later determined that\n\nthat individual had never been in Cleveland and that his DNA was not, in fact, a\n\nmatch to the DNA from the rape kit.\n\n              After S.S. spoke with police in 1995, she did not hear anything further\n\nabout the case until 2014. In April 2014, an agent from the Bureau of Criminal\n\nInvestigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) contacted S.S. and showed her a photo array that included a\n\nphotograph of the Cincinnati man identified from the CODIS hit. Berry was not\n\nincluded in that photo array. S.S. did not identify anyone in that photo array as her\n\nassailant.\n\n              On September 14, 2014, Investigator Riolo was assigned to the case.\n\nHe testified that he reviewed the case file, including the 1995 police report in which\n\fBerry had been identified as the suspect. He then began looking for Berry and S.S.\n\nto get their \u201cside[s] of the story\u201d and \u201csee where [he] went from there.\u201d Investigator\n\nRiolo indicated that on November 20, 2014, he went to an address he believed to be\n\nBerry\u2019s residence, 16210 Arcade Avenue and left his card. He stated that Berry\u2019s\n\nmother called him back and said that she had not seen Berry, that he did not live\n\nthere, that he lived with \u201cgirlfriends around town\u201d and that she did not know where\n\nhe was but that she would let Berry know Investigator Riolo was looking for him.\n\n               On November 25, 2014, Riolo located and reinterviewed S.S. and\n\nprepared a photo array for S.S. that included Berry. S.S. identified Berry as her\n\nassailant in the photo array. Investigator Riolo then continued his efforts to locate\n\nBerry. He stated that he learned that Berry had an outstanding warrant for failure\n\nto pay child support and that he had children with two different women \u2014 Quiniece\n\nBanks and Kimberly Woods. Investigator Riolo obtained their addresses1 and spoke\n\nwith the women on December 17, 2014. Both of the women lived in Euclid, Ohio.\n\n               Investigator Riolo testified that he informed both Banks and Woods\n\nthat he needed to speak with Berry and that \u201c[a]t that point[,] he wasn\u2019t in any\n\ntrouble,\u201d he just wanted to interview him. Investigator Riolo stated that Banks told\n\nhim that she did not know where Berry was and that she could not give him an\n\n\n\n      1 Investigator Riolo testified that on December 16, 2014, he had one of the BCI\nanalysts who worked with his task force \u201crun Mr. Berry for any addresses\u201d and that she\n\u201cdid a workup.\u201d There is no evidence in the record as to what this workup entailed or\nwhat information was gleaned from it, other than that Berry had \u201cmissed a court date or\nsomething,\u201d that Berry had an outstanding warrant for failure to make child support\npayments and the names and addresses of the mothers of Berry\u2019s children.\n\faddress or telephone number for Berry but that \u201che comes by, and he sees the kids.\u201d\n\nInvestigator Riolo testified that Woods told him that she had filed \u201cnonsupport\n\npapers\u201d against Berry and that Berry was living with Banks.           Woods gave\n\nInvestigator Riolo two telephone numbers for Berry. Investigator Riolo stated that\n\nhe called both numbers but \u201cdidn\u2019t get an answer on either one.\u201d Investigator Riolo\n\nstated that he left his card with both women and that they both said they would let\n\nBerry know Investigator Riolo was looking for him.\n\n              Investigator Riolo stated that because he was never able to locate\n\nBerry, the state \u201cwent forward and indicted\u201d Berry. Berry was indicted less than two\n\nweeks later. Investigator Riolo stated that he sought a warrant \u201cas part of the\n\nindictment\u201d because \u201cthat was the only way * * * I would be able to recover some\n\nDNA from Mr. Berry\u201d because \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t have DNA in the system at that time * * *\n\nplus I had enough probable cause to have him arrested based on the identification\n\nof [S.S.].\u201d\n\n              Banks, who had two children with Berry, testified that Berry had lived\n\nwith her \u201con and off\u201d from 1998 until 2014 or 2015. She stated that, at one point,\n\npolice came to her house looking for Berry and informed her that he was being\n\ninvestigated for a rape. She testified that she could not remember whether Berry\n\nwas living with her at that time because they were \u201cbroken up for a while\u201d and he\n\nleft, then he came back and eventually their relationship ended. She testified that\n\fshe told Berry that the police were looking for him.2 According to Banks, when Berry\n\nleft Banks, he lived at \u201chis girlfriend\u2019s house.\u201d Although they were no longer\n\ntogether, Berry visited his children \u201csometimes.\u201d          Banks testified that, to her\n\nknowledge, Berry was \u201calways in town.\u201d Investigator Riolo testified that he had no\n\ninformation that Berry had ever left Cuyahoga County.\n\n      The Indictment, Summons and Warrant and Efforts to Execute\n      Same\n\n                 A warrant was issued on the indictment on December 30, 2014. The\n\nwarrant listed an address of 16210 Arcade Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44110, for Berry.\n\nThe trial court docket indicates that on same day, a summons was sent to Berry via\n\nFederal Express at a different address, 3002 E. 71st Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44104,\n\nand that the capias was \u201cprinted and sent to sheriff\u201d on December 31, 2014.\n\n                 On January 14, 2015 \u2014 the date initially scheduled for Berry\u2019s\n\narraignment \u2014 a notation was made on the docket, stating \u201coriginal capias remains\n\nfrom 12/30/2014.\u201d A notation was made on the docket the following day, indicating\n\nthat the summons that had been sent out for service on December 30, 2014, had\n\nbeen returned on January 6, 2015 and that there had a \u201cfailure of service\u201d on Berry\n\ndue to a \u201cbad address.\u201d3 The docket does not reflect any subsequent attempts to\n\nserve the summons on Berry.\n\n\n\n      2   It is unclear from the record when Banks told Berry police were looking for him.\n\n      3 Although the docket includes entries relating to the service and failure of service\nof the summons, documentation showing that the summons was sent and the Federal\nExpress receipt showing a failure of service are missing from the file in this case.\n\f              Investigator Riolo testified that on January 14, 2015, Berry called and\n\nleft a voicemail message for him. According to Investigator Riolo, Berry stated that\n\nhe had seen a \u201cwanted poster\u201d identifying him and was calling to talk to Investigator\n\nRiolo. Investigator Riolo stated that Berry did not leave a number and that his caller\n\nID indicated that the call came from an anonymous number. Investigator Riolo did\n\nnot record, transcribe or otherwise preserve the voicemail message \u201cother than to\n\nput it in [his] notes.\u201d Investigator Riolo stated that he did not know to what Berry\n\nwas referring because he \u201chad nothing to do\u201d with looking for Berry after the arrest\n\nwarrant was issued in December 2014.\n\n              Following his indictment, police attempted to locate Berry on two\n\noccasions. Cuyahoga County Sheriff \u201cduty reports\u201d indicate that on February 10,\n\n2015, at 10:59 a.m., police went to 16210 Arcade Avenue and spoke with Berry\u2019s\n\nmom. \u201c[N]o additional info\u201d was obtained. More than a year later, on March 22,\n\n2016, police made a second attempt to locate Berry. At 5:42 a.m., they went 1720\n\nAllandale Avenue in East Cleveland. There is nothing in the record regarding the\n\nsource of this address or why it was believed to have been associated with Berry. It\n\nwas a \u201cbad address\u201d; the resident said that she did not know Berry. At 5:55 a.m.,\n\npolice returned to 16210 Arcade Avenue. Detective Riegelmayer testified that 16210\n\nArcade Avenue was \u201cstill the family\u2019s address.\u201d4 He stated that an officer spoke with\n\nBerry\u2019s father, who said he had not seen Berry in months, and also spoke with a\n\n\n      4 Detective Riegelmayer testified that he had no role in any effort to apprehend\nBerry prior to January 8, 2015.\n\f\u201cfamily friend,\u201d who stated he had seen Berry at the home the previous Sunday.\n\nDetective Riegelmayer had no information regarding any other efforts to locate\n\nBerry.\n\n                 On or about December 7, 2016, Berry was arrested following a\n\nDecember 5, 2016 traffic stop for failure to stop at a stop sign. At the traffic stop,\n\nBerry initially gave police a false name, Gregory Steel, and a false date of birth. He\n\nwas cited for driving under suspension, failure to stop at a stop sign and giving false\n\ninformation at a traffic stop.5\n\n         The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling on the Motion to Dismiss\n\n                 On July 15, 2020, the trial court issued an order granting Berry\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds. The trial court explained its\n\nruling as follows:\n\n         The court finds that the relevant time line is as follows: the incident\n         occurred on January 8, 1995. The defendant was subsequently indicted\n         on December 30, 2014. The initial arraignment, to which the\n         defendant failed to appear[,] was held on January 14, 2015. Defendant\n         was subsequently arrested December 7, 2016, 22 years after the\n         incident. At the hearing, the court specifically notes that the testimony\n         of Inv. Riolo was simply a reiteration of the testimony taken by the\n         court at trial several years earlier. The testimony of Inv. Riolo added\n         no new relevant evidence to the issue of the statute of limitations\n         analysis rendered by the Eighth District in State v. Berry, 8th Dist.\n         Cuyahoga No. 106415, 2018-Ohio-4855. Further, the court finds that\n         the testimony of Det. Riegelmayer [is] inconsequential as the\n         investigation performed by the Sheriff\u2019s Department occurred after the\n         20 year statute of limitations had already expired. Possibly, had these\n\n         5\n         In addition to the witness testimony, the state also introduced several other\nexhibits, including copies of the capias on the indictment, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff\u2019s\nOffice duty reports dated February 10, 2015 and March 22, 2016, Berry\u2019s December 5,\n2016 traffic citation and a printout of the municipal court docket relating to Berry\u2019s\nDecember 5, 2016 traffic citation.\n\f       steps been taken prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the\n       court could have found that the state did, in fact, exercise the\n       reasonable diligence required by law. See R.C. 2901.13(A)(3).\n       However, because the related events testified to at the hearing took\n       place after the expiration of the statute of limitations, said events\n       cannot be considered as evidence that reasonable diligence occurred\n       prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations o[n] January 8,\n       2015.6\n\n                The state appealed, raising the following single assignment of error\n\nfor review:\n\n       The trial court erred in dismissing this case because the defendant\u2019s\n       prosecution did not violate the statute of limitations.\n\nLaw and Analysis\n\n                The state argues that the trial court erred in dismissing the indictment\n\non statute of limitations grounds because the trial court (1) \u201cfailed to consider law\n\nenforcement efforts to bring Berry to justice, that occurred after the natural\n\nexpiration of the statute of limitations\u201d and (2) \u201cfailed to consider that the statute of\n\nlimitations was tolled as of the date the indictment was filed * * * because of the\n\nreasonable efforts that were undertaken to locate and apprehend Berry on the\n\n\n\n\n       6 Because the trial  court found that the state did not commence prosecution within\nthe statute of limitations, it did not consider Berry\u2019s argument that there was unjustifiable\npreindictment delay. There is, however, considerable evidence in the record to support\nthat argument, particularly given that Berry\u2019s identity was known to police in 1995, police\narrested Berry in February 1995, the state apparently ceased all investigation of the crime\nshortly after the incident until late 2012 when S.S.\u2019s rape kit was submitted for testing, no\nnew evidence linking Berry to the crime was uncovered before the state indicted Berry in\n2014 and key witnesses were allegedly lost or unavailable as a result of the state\u2019s\ninexplicable delay in prosecution. Because the trial court did not address that issue below\nand the parties did not address the issue in their appellate briefs, we do not address it\nfurther here.\n\findictment.\u201d Alternatively, the state argues that its prosecution of Berry was timely\n\ndue to Berry\u2019s efforts to evade prosecution.\n\n      Standard of Review\n\n              When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss for\n\nfailure to comply with the statute of limitations, we accord deference to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s findings of fact, but engage in a de novo review of the trial court\u2019s legal\n\nconclusions and its application of the facts to the law. See, e.g., Cleveland v.\n\nBermudez, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109018, 2020-Ohi0-4296, \u00b6 6. De novo review\n\nrequires an independent review of the trial court\u2019s decision without any deference\n\nto the trial court\u2019s determination. State v. Kehoe, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106385,\n\n2018-Ohio-3589, \u00b6 17.\n\n      Criminal Statute of Limitations\n\n              In this case, the criminal conduct at issue occurred in 1995. At that\n\ntime, the statute of limitations for rape and kidnaping was six years. By amendment\n\neffective March 9, 1999, the Ohio General Assembly extended the statute of\n\nlimitations for rape and kidnapping from 6 to 20 years.            See former R.C.\n\n2901.13(A)(3)(c) (prosecution for a violation of R.C. 2907.02 and 2905.01 \u201cshall be\n\nbarred unless it is commenced within twenty years after the offense is committed\u201d).\n\nThe amendment applied retroactively to offenses committed prior to the\n\namendment, provided that the statute of limitations had not yet expired by March\n\n9, 1999. See State v. Copeland, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89455, 2008-Ohio-234, \u00b6 11-\n\n12.\n\f                 The six-year statute of limitations applicable to the offenses at issue\n\nhad not yet expired when the General Assembly\u2019s amendment of R.C. 2901.13\n\nbecame effective in March 1999. Accordingly, the 20-year statute of limitations\n\napplies here.7\n\n                 A criminal statute of limitations \u201climit[s] exposure to prosecution to\n\na certain fixed period of time following the occurrence of those acts the General\n\nAssembly has decided to punish by criminal sanctions.\u201d State v. Climaco, Climaco,\n\nSeminatore, Lefkowitz & Garofoli Co., L.P.A., 85 Ohio St.3d 582, 586, 709 N.E.2d\n\n1192 (1999).

United States, 397 U.S. 112, 114-\n\n115, 90 S.Ct. 858, 25 L.Ed.2d 156 (1970). In other words, the purpose of a criminal\n\nstatute of limitations is not to give offenders a chance to avoid criminal\n\nresponsibility for their actions, but rather, \u201cto discourage inefficient or dilatory law\n\nenforcement\u201d and ensure that a criminal prosecution is \u201c\u2018\u201cbased on reasonably fresh,\n\nand therefore more trustworthy evidence.\u2019\u201d\u201d Climaco at 586, quoting State v.\n\nHensley, 59 Ohio St.3d 136, 138, 571 N.E.2d 711 (1991), quoting the Ohio Legislative\n\n\n\n       7 Effective July 16, 2015, the statute of limitations for rape extended to 25 years.\nR.C. 2901.13(A)(4). The amendment applies retroactively to an offense committed prior\nto July 16, 2015 \u201cif prosecution for that violation was not barred * * * as it existed on the\nday prior to July 16, 2015.\u201d R.C. 2901.13(L).\n\fService Commission comment to R.C. 2901.13; see also Copeland at \u00b6 10 (\u2018\u201cThe\n\nstatute of limitations provides the \u2018primary guarantee against bringing overly stale\n\ncriminal charges.\u2019\u201d), quoting State v. Henley, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86591, 2006-\n\nOhio-2728, \u00b6 5. The state bears the burden of proving that a prosecution falls within\n\nthe statute of limitations. State v. Hawkins, 2019-Ohio-5133, 150 N.E.3d 519, \u00b6 12\n\n(8th Dist.), citing Climaco at 587.\n\n               A criminal prosecution is barred unless it is \u201ccommenced\u201d within the\n\napplicable statute of limitations. R.C. 2901.13(A)(3). Pursuant to former R.C.\n\n2901.13(E) (now R.C. 2901.13(F)),8 a prosecution is \u201ccommenced\u201d\n\n      on the date an indictment is returned or an information filed, or on the\n      date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or on the date a warrant,\n      summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever occurs first. A\n      prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or the\n      filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue\n      and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced\n      upon issuance of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process, unless\n      reasonable diligence is exercised to execute the same.\n\n               Former R.C. 2901.13(G) (now R.C. 2901.13(H)) further provides:\n\n      The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the accused\n      purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this\n      state or concealed the accused\u2019s identity or whereabouts is prima-facie\n      evidence of the accused\u2019s purpose to avoid prosecution.\n\n               The state contends that prosecution of this case was timely\n\ncommenced and that the state exercised the reasonable diligence required under\n\n\n\n      8 At the time the indictment was issued in 2014, this section was codified under\nR.C. 2901.13(E). The statute was amended in 2015, and this section is now codified under\nR.C. 2901.13(F). Likewise, former R.C. 2901.13(G) is now codified under R.C. 2901.13(H).\n\fformer R.C. 2901.13(E) because (1) an indictment was filed prior to the expiration\n\nof the statute of limitations, (2) a warrant was issued, (3) a summons was served via\n\ncommercial carrier, (4) a capias issued when Berry did not appear in court on the\n\ndate scheduled for his arraignment, (5) after the warrant was issued, the warrant\n\nunit went back to Berry\u2019s mother\u2019s house looking for him, (6) the Sheriff\u2019s\n\nDepartment \u201cacted on any viable information regarding * * * Berry\u201d and (7) Berry\n\ngave false contact information to a police officer during the December 2016 traffic\n\nstop.\n\n               In this case, the indictment was returned on December 30, 2014.\n\nThat same day, a warrant was issued on the indictment and a summons was sent out\n\nto Berry via Federal Express. The following day, a capias was \u201cprinted and sent to\n\nsheriff.\u201d All of this occurred approximately one week before the expiration of the\n\nstatute of limitations.\n\n               Under former R.C. 2901.13(E), a prosecution is not \u201ccommenced\u201d\n\nmerely by the return of an indictment or the issuance of a summons or warrant. In\n\norder for the return of an indictment or the issuance of a summons or warrant to\n\n\u201ccommence\u201d a criminal prosecution, the statute requires the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence in the issuance and execution of process on the indictment or in the\n\nexecution of the warrant or summons. \u2018\u201c[A] prosecution is not commenced so as to\n\ntoll the running of the statute of limitations merely by the issuance of a summons or\n\nwarrant. It is commenced by the issuance of a summons or warrant plus the exercise\n\fof reasonable diligence to execute the same.\u2019\u201d Hawkins, 2019-Ohio-5133, at \u00b6 15,\n\nquoting State v. Morris, 20 Ohio App.3d 321, 322, 486 N.E.2d 168 (10th Dist.1984).\n\n              Once a defendant raises the issue that the statute of limitations has\n\nexpired, the state has the burden to show that it exercised the requisite \u201creasonable\n\ndiligence\u201d in executing the summons or warrant. See, e.g., Bermudez, 2020-Ohio-\n\n4296, at \u00b6 9; Hawkins at \u00b6 16. The Ohio Supreme Court has defined \u201creasonable\n\ndiligence\u201d as \u201c\u2018[a] fair, proper and due degree of care and activity, measured with\n\nreference to the particular circumstances; such diligence, care, or attention as might\n\nbe expected from a man of ordinary prudence and activity.\u2019\u201d Sizemore v. Smith, 6\n\nOhio St.3d 330, 332, 453 N.E.2d 632 (1983), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 412\n\n(5th Ed.1979). What constitutes reasonable diligence depends on the particular\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case. Bermudez at \u00b6 8, citing Sizemore at 332.\n\n              In this case, the state indicted Berry on December 30, 2014 \u2014 a few\n\ndays before the statutory time ran \u2014 but he was never served with the summons and\n\nwas not arrested until nearly two years later \u2014 well past the statutory time for\n\nprosecution. Following a thorough review of the record and consideration of all of\n\nthe relevant facts and circumstances, we conclude that the state has not met its\n\nburden of establishing that it exercised reasonable diligence in executing the\n\nsummons or warrant as required to timely commence prosecution under former\n\nR.C. 2901.13(E).\n\f      Reasonable Diligence in Executing the Summons or Warrant\n\n              \u201cOnce a warrant is issued, it must be executed by either an arrest or\n\nsummons using reasonable diligence in compliance with Crim. R. 4(D).\u201d State v.\n\nPannell, 2017-Ohio-4286, 92 N.E.3d 280, \u00b6 18 (5th Dist.), citing State v. Greer, 2\n\nOhio App.3d 399, 442 N.E.2d 473 (1st Dist.1981). In general, the state exercises\n\n\u201creasonable diligence\u201d when it can demonstrate that it made an effort to serve the\n\nsummons in a manner provided by Crim.R. 4(D). Bermudez, 2020-Ohio-4296, at\n\n\u00b6 8, citing State v. Stevens, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 67400, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS\n\n5772, 4 (Dec. 22, 1994), citing State v. Morris, 20 Ohio App.3d 321, 322-323, 486\n\nN.E.2d 168 (1oth Dist.1984); see also State v. Gallant, 174 Ohio App.3d 264, 2007-\n\nOhio-6714, 881 N.E.2d 907, \u00b6 28 (3d Dist.) (\u201cTo constitute reasonable diligence\n\nunder R.C. 2901.13(E) service of the summons and complaint must first be in\n\naccordance with Crim.R. 4(D).\u201d) (emphasis deleted).\n\n              Here, however, there appears to be no dispute that the summons was\n\nnot served in compliance with former Crim.R. 4(D). As it existed in 2014, Crim.R.\n\n4(D)(3) provided, in relevant part:\n\n      Summons may be served upon a defendant by delivering a copy to the\n      defendant personally, or by leaving it at the defendant\u2019s usual place of\n      residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing\n      therein, or, except when the summons is issued in lieu of executing a\n      warrant by arrest, by mailing it to the defendant\u2019s last known address\n      by certified mail with a return receipt requested. When service of\n      summons is made by certified mail it shall be served by the clerk in the\n      manner prescribed by Civil Rule 4.1(1).\n\fThus, in 2014, Crim.R. 4(D) did not provide for service via commercial carrier, as\n\noccurred here. Accordingly, the effort to serve Berry with the summons via Federal\n\nExpress on December 30, 2014 did not constitute reasonable diligence. See, e.g.,\n\nGallant at \u00b6 28 (3d Dist.) (where Crim.R. 4(D) does not provide for service via\n\nregular U.S. mail, state\u2019s attempt to serve summons via regular U.S. mail could not\n\nconstitute reasonable diligence under former R.C. 2901.13(E)); Morris, 20 Ohio\n\nApp.3d at 323, 486 N.E.2d 168 (\u201c[I]n order to ground a claim that reasonable\n\ndiligence was exercised, the prosecution first was required to demonstrate that an\n\neffort had been made to serve the summons in a manner provided by Crim. R. 4(D).\n\nBecause this threshold requirement was not complied with, the inquiry need not\n\nprogress to the stage where a determination need be made whether an effort to\n\ncomply with the provisions of Crim. R. 4(D) amounted to an exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence to execute the summons.\u201d).\n\n              Further, although the warrant issued on December 30, 2014 listed an\n\naddress of 16210 Arcade Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44110 for Berry, the docket\n\nindicates that the summons was sent to Berry at a different address \u2014 3002 E. 71st\n\nStreet, Cleveland, Ohio 44104.9 The docket reflects that it was returned a week later\n\nas a \u201cbad address.\u201d There is nothing in the record that indicates the source of the\n\n3002 E. 71st Street address, why that address was believed to have been associated\n\nwith Berry or why the summons was sent to Berry at that address. There is nothing\n\n\n      9  Although the state had previously asserted that this was Berry\u2019s \u201clast known\ncurrent address,\u201d there is nothing in the record before us to support that assertion.\n\fin the record to indicate that any subsequent attempts to serve the summons were\n\nmade at that address, the Arcade Avenue address or any other address after the state\n\nwas notified of failure of service. Although whether the state exercised reasonable\n\ndiligence depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case, \u201cgenerally a single\n\nattempt to serve a defendant in compliance with Crim.R. 4(D) is insufficient to\n\nconstitute reasonable diligence.\u201d Gallant at \u00b6 30; see also State v. King, 103 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 210, 212-213, 658 N.E.2d 1138 (10th Dist.1995) (state did not show\n\nreasonable diligence when it made only one attempt to serve defendant with\n\nsummons where defendant\u2019s whereabouts \u201ccould have been easily ascertained\u201d);\n\nState v. Myers, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87973, 2007-Ohio-279, \u00b6 4, 17 (state did not\n\ndemonstrate reasonable diligence in attempting to serve defendant where no\n\nadditional efforts were made to serve him after a failed certified mail attempt); State\n\nv. McNichols, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2000CA00058, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 4071, 9\n\n(Sept. 5, 2000) (single attempt to serve defendant in twelve years \u201cdoes not\n\ndemonstrate due diligence\u201d). Accordingly, the state has not shown that it exercised\n\nreasonable diligence in the execution of the summons.\n\n               Nor has the state shown that it exercised reasonable diligence in the\n\nexecution of the warrant. First, it is undisputed that \u2014 other than the failed,\n\nimproper attempt at service of the summons via Federal Express \u2014 no effort was\n\fmade to execute the summons or warrant prior to the natural expiration of the\n\nstatute of limitations on January 8, 2015.10\n\n               Second, although the state asserts in its brief that the Sheriff\u2019s\n\nDepartment acted upon \u201cany viable information regarding * * * Berry,\u201d the state\n\npresented evidence that only two attempts were made to locate Berry in the two\n\nyears after the warrant was issued \u2014 once on February 10, 2015 at the 16210 Arcade\n\nAvenue address and a second time, more than a year later, on March 22, 2016, first\n\nat an address on 1720 Allandale Avenue in East Cleveland, and then, again, at the\n\n16210 Arcade Avenue address. There is nothing in the record to indicate what led\n\npolice to believe Berry might be connected to the 1720 Allandale Avenue address.\n\n               When Berry attempted to contact Investigator Riolo and left a\n\nvoicemail message for him on January 14, 2015, no attempt was made to locate Berry\n\nuntil nearly a month later. Even though Berry visited his children with Banks, no\n\nattempt was made by the Sheriff\u2019s Department to locate Berry at that address.\n\nAlthough Woods gave Investigator Riolo two telephone numbers for Berry, there is\n\nno indication in the record that anyone ever attempted to contact Berry through\n\n\n       10 The trial court held that only actions conducted during the limitations period\ncould be considered in determining whether the state exercised reasonable diligence\nunder former R.C. 2901.13(E). The state challenges this interpretation of former R.C.\n2901.13(E) and asserts that under the plain language of the statute, consideration of\nreasonable diligence is not limited to conduct that occurred prior to the natural expiration\nof the statute of limitations. We acknowledge that no such limitation appears in the\nlanguage of former R.C. 2901.13(E). However, we need not resolve the issue here because\neven considering what occurred after the natural expiration of the statute of limitations,\nwe find that the state has not met its burden of demonstrating that it exercised reasonable\ndiligence in executing the summons or warrant.\n\fthose telephone numbers after Investigator Riolo called the numbers sometime on\n\nor after December 17, 2014 and \u201cdidn\u2019t get an answer.\u201d And although a \u201cfamily\n\nfriend\u201d had informed police when they visited the Arcade Avenue address on\n\nMarch 22, 2016 that he had seen Berry at the home less than a week earlier, police\n\ndid nothing further to follow up on that lead. No other addresses were checked.11\n\nNo further attempts to locate Berry were made.            The only reason Berry was\n\nultimately arrested was because he committed an unrelated traffic violation.\n\n               \u201cReasonable diligence requires taking steps which an individual of\n\nordinary prudence would reasonably expect to be successful in locating a\n\ndefendant\u2019s address.\u201d Sizemore, 6 Ohio St.3d at 332, 453 N.E.2d 632. It requires\n\nthe \u201cuse [of] common and readily available sources\u201d in searching for a defendant.\n\nId.\n\n               Detective Riegelmayer testified that it was a \u201cstandard affair\u201d when\n\n\u201cresearching a warrant\u201d in the fugitive unit to \u201cresearch the person,\u201d e.g., to obtain\n\ninformation from \u201c[the] bureau of motor vehicles, where they say they reside from\n\ntheir ID, to their criminal history, to past arrests and where they were located.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the fact that Berry had remained in Cuyahoga County since 1995,\n\nthere is no indication in the record that the Sheriff\u2019s Department did this with\n\nrespect to Berry. There is nothing in the record to suggest the Sheriff\u2019s Department\n\n\n      11  Berry asserts in his brief that \u201c[t]he state had other options that they did not\nexplore\u201d and asserts that \u201c[a] check on the Sheriff\u2019s Department website identifies six\naddresses on file for Albert Berry\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Clerk\u2019s Office as well had several\naddresses for Berry.\u201d However, Berry\u2019s assertions in his brief are not supported by\ncitations to any evidence in the record.\n\fsearched bureau of motor vehicle records, court records, tax records, child support\n\npayment records, employment records or any other available records for contact\n\ninformation for Berry.\n\n               Detective Riegelmayer further testified that if the fugitive unit \u201ccan\u2019t\n\nfind someone,\u201d they will \u201csend things out to many different platforms,\u201d such as\n\nFacebook, Twitter and Crimestoppers, \u201cto see if we could get any call backs or\n\nanyone that would call in to let us know anonymously whether or not they had seen\n\nthe person\u201d or will \u201cpush it to our marshall\u2019s fugitive unit or sometimes contact * * *\n\nthe FBI depending on the type of crime.\u201d Detective Riegelmayer, however, could not\n\nstate whether any of these steps had been taken with respect to Berry.\n\n               The state has not identified any cases in its brief in which reasonable\n\ndiligence was found to have been exercised under circumstances similar to those\n\npresent here.

Bess, 126 Ohio St.3d 350, 2010-Ohio-3292, 933 N.E.2d 1076,\n\n\u00b6 24. The state contends that because Berry initially gave a false name when he was\n\npulled over for a traffic stop in December 2016, this meant that Berry was \u201caware of\n\nthe investigation all along\u201d and was \u201cavoiding prosecution.\u201d We disagree.\n\n               The fact that Berry gave police a false name at a traffic stop on\n\nDecember 5, 2016 \u2014 22 years after the incident \u2014 does not establish that he acted\n\fpurposely to prevent the state from commencing a timely prosecution. Berry had\n\nnever been served in the case and, by the time of the traffic stop, the statute of\n\nlimitations had long since run. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Berry\n\nhad previously done anything to conceal his whereabouts or did anything to\n\npurposely avoid prosecution after his arrest in 1995. The record reflects that Berry\n\nhad been living openly in Cuyahoga County since the incident. Banks testified that\n\nBerry had been living with her on and off from 1998 until 2014 or 2015 and that he\n\nhad never left Cuyahoga County.        Investigator Riolo testified that he had no\n\ninformation or evidence that Berry had ever left the jurisdiction. After Berry learned\n\nthat Investigator Riolo was looking for him, Berry initiated contact with Investigator\n\nRiolo, calling him on January 14, 2015. When Investigator Riolo did not pick up,\n\nBerry left a voicemail message. Because the voicemail message was not preserved\n\nor transcribed, the specific contents of that message are unknown. However, there\n\nis no claim that Berry provided any false or misleading information regarding his\n\nwhereabouts in his voicemail message to Investigator Riolo. Based on the record\n\nbefore us, the trial court did not err in concluding that the statute of limitations was\n\nnot tolled due to Berry\u2019s purposeful efforts to avoid prosecution.\n\n               Because the state did not meet its burden of establishing that it\n\nexercised reasonable diligence in executing the summons or warrant or that the\n\nstatute of limitations was tolled due to Berry\u2019s purposeful efforts to avoid\n\nprosecution, the trial court did not err in granting Berry\u2019s motion to dismiss. The\n\nstate\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.\n\f              Judgment affirmed.\n\n      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant the costs herein taxed.\n\n      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\nCuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nEILEEN A.
