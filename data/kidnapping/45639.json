            "opinion_text": "\nMEMORANDUM **\nDefendant-Appellant, Tomas Guzman-Flores, appeals the sentence imposed for his judgment of conviction entered in the District Court on February 6, 2007, for being present in the United States after having been deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Guzman-Flores claims that (1) the District Court erred by imposing a sixteen-level crime-of-violence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(A)(ii) based on Guzman-Flores\u2019s conviction, prior to his deportation, of criminal sexual penetration, because he was not convicted under any categorical crime of violence and no judicially noticeable documents established, based on the specific facts of his offense, that he was convicted of a crime of violence; (2) Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), requires that the applicable statutory maximum sentence was two years incarceration because the date of his deportation was not alleged in the indictment; and (3) the District Court\u2019s judicial finding of the date of deportation was erroneous under Ap-prendi.\nOn March 6, 1995, in New Mexico state court, Guzman-Flores pled guilty without allocuting to the facts, pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970) (accepting as constitutionally firm a guilty plea unaccompanied by an express admission of guilt as to the criminal act), to three counts of criminal sexual penetration, one count of kidnapping, and one count of intimidation of a witness. On August 6, 1999, after having been released from prison, Guzman-Flores was deported from the *33United States. In sentencing Guzman-Flores, the District Court based the sixteen-level crime-of-violenee enhancement on Guzman-Flores\u2019s conviction for criminal sexual penetration, in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30 \u2014 9\u201411(C)(2), finding that the criminal sexual penetration statute described a categorical crime of violence.\nThe government has abandoned any argument that N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-9-11(C)(2) describes a categorical crime of violence. It instead argues that Guzman-Flores\u2019s sentence may be affirmed based on his contemporaneous conviction for felony kidnapping, in violation of the former N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-4-1 (1994). Guzman-Flores replies that New Mexico\u2019s felony kidnapping statute does not support a crime-of-violence enhancement because that statute, as applied by the New Mexico courts, defines kidnapping more broadly than the generic definition of kidnapping as set forth by this Court.\nAs the government apparently concedes, the District Court erred by imposing the sixteen-level enhancement based on Guzman-Flores\u2019s conviction for criminal sexual penetration. By relying on Guzman-Flores\u2019s sexual penetration offense as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d triggering the sentencing enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court improperly determined the appropriate Guidelines sentence. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); United States v. Carty, 520 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). Whether Guzman-Flores\u2019s conviction for felony kidnapping, in violation of N.M. Stat. \u00a7 30-4-1 (1994), could support the crime of violence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(A)(ii) is not properly before us at this juncture, as the district court did not rely on that conviction in its Guidelines calculation. We therefore vacate Guzman-Flores\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing, without prejudice to any Guidelines argument the government may make on remand based on the felony kidnapping conviction.\nThe government concedes that the District Court erred by making a judicial finding that Guzman-Flores\u2019s prior conviction pre-dated his deportation. The government argues, however, that uncontro-verted evidence later established that Guzman-Flores\u2019s deportation occurred on August 6, 1999, after his prior conviction, and the District Court\u2019s error was therefore harmless. We review this issue de novo, see United States v. Smith, 390 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe ... review de novo whether the district court violated the constitutional rule articulated in Ap-prendi\u201d), and we agree that the District Court\u2019s error was harmless, see United States v. Zepeda-Martinez, 470 F.3d 909, 913 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that Apprendi error is harmless \u201cif the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the result would have been the same absent the error\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\nThe sentence is VACATED. REMANDED for resentencing.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.\n\n",
