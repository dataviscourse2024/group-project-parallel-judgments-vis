            "opinion_text": "\nWILSON, Circuit Judge:\nThis appeal involves a defense attorney\u2019s temporary absence from the courtroom at his client\u2019s trial when inculpatory testimony was admitted into evidence and contributed to his conviction. Appellant Alexander Michael Roy (Roy) alleges that his criminal conviction was obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, *12872047, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), which creates a presumption of prejudice and requires a new trial when counsel is absent during a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the trial. Because (1) Roy was a sole defendant during his criminal trial, (2) the afternoon session of Roy\u2019s trial commenced while his counsel was actually and physically absent, and (3) during that absence, evidence directly inculpating Roy in a crime for which he was eventually convicted was presented to the jury, we conclude that Roy was denied counsel at a critical stage, and based on Cronic, we are required to reverse Roy\u2019s conviction as to all counts of the indictment and remand the case to the district court for a new trial.\nI.\nPursuant to a \u201creverse sting\u201d operation conducted in conjunction with the Osceola County Sherriffs Office (OCSO), Detective Athena Ross of the Sumter County Sher-riffs Office (SCSO) placed an advertisement on Craigslist purportedly soliciting sex for two women. Roy responded to the advertisement, after which Ross, acting undercover, told Roy that the advertisement was for herself, a thirty-year-old woman named Denise, and her daughter, a thirteen-year-old girl named Torie. Roy, \u201cDenise,\u201d and \u201cTorie\u201d (played by a second undercover SCSO detective) discussed various potential sexual activities by email, telephone, and text message. Eventually, they arranged a meeting at a Waffle House restaurant in Kissimmee, Florida. Roy drove to the restaurant and entered the parking lot, but he drove away without ever parking his vehicle. OCSO deputies pulled him over and arrested him, finding condoms and lubricant in his pockets.\nOCSO conducted two searches of Roy\u2019s home, leading to the seizure of a desktop computer, a laptop, a thumb drive, and three compact discs, all of which contained photographs and videos containing child pornography. Detectives also found the text of online conversations Roy had with L.B., a minor with whom Roy had carried on a romantic relationship. L.B. was depicted in some of the pornography found on his computer, which Roy himself created. Much of the child pornography depicted other underage girls.\nRoy was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida on one count of enticing or attempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) (Count 1) and four counts of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2) (Counts 2-5). A motion to suppress the evidence seized during the execution of the warrants was denied.\nDuring a portion of Roy\u2019s jury trial, defense counsel was absent from the courtroom immediately following a lunchtime recess. There was no explanation for the absence in the record. Prior to the recess, the court had stated that the trial would recommence at 1:30 p.m. Instead, it started at 1:29 p.m. without defense counsel present; counsel did not arrive until 1:36 p.m. The record does not reflect any reaction by the court or the government either to counsel\u2019s absence or to his late arrival, though the court reporter did note both in the transcript. During counsel\u2019s absence, the government offered the following testimony from its computer forensics expert witness, Detective Charlie Longson of OCSO:\nQ. Now, did you have occasion to find during your forensic examination a folder on the desktop computer named \u201cMy Pictures,\u201d which would fall within the \u201cMy Documents\u201d file that was on that computer?\nA. Yes, I did.\n*1288Q. And within the \u201cMy Pictures\u201d folder, were there other subfolders?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And how were they categorized within that general folder of \u201cMy Pictures\u201d?\nA. Those folders were categorized by date, the year first, month second, and the date third.\nQ. And were you able to determine any folders that had \u2014 or contained notable images within them?\nA. Yes. I did find folders with notable images.\nQ. And what were \u2014 what was the first folder of concern that you found?\nA. The first one I found was named \u201c2006-03-11.\u201d\nQ. And would that folder have been created by a user of that computer? A. Yes, it was.\nQ. And did you find any images within that folder?\nA. Yes, I did. I found six images.\nQ. And would you please describe the images to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury within that March 11, 2006, folder that you found?\nA. These images are a nude white female who was bound to a table by her feet with rope. The subject was laid across the table and had her head covered with an orange cloth which was secured around her neck with silver duct tape.\nQ. Were you able to determine forensically how those pictures had been taken?\nA. Yes. They were taken with a Kodak v530 zoom digital camera.\nQ. And were you able to determine forensically a date and time those images were taken?\nA. Yes, I was. These were taken on March the 10th, 2005, at 6:49 p.m.\nCounsel returned soon after this exchange and, upon his return, did not raise any objections. Direct examination of Detective Longson continued uninterrupted. Detective Longson later testified as to the identity of the individual portrayed in the photographs, L.B., as well as her date of birth: May 9, 1989. The jury found Roy guilty on all counts, and the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment.\nRoy raises four claims on appeal. Of these, we address only the Sixth Amendment denial of counsel claim. Specifically, Roy contends that his counsel\u2019s absence occurred during a critical stage of trial when inculpatory evidence was admitted against him and that, therefore, he is entitled to a new trial pursuant to Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658-59, 104 S.Ct. at 2046-47.\nII.\n\u201cThe claim that the temporary absence of trial counsel during the taking of evidence constitutes a Sixth Amendment violation presents a mixed question of law and fact and, as such, is subject to plenary review.\u201d Vines v. United States, 28 F.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir.1994).\nA criminal defendant is entitled to the \u201cAssistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. In Cronic, the Supreme Court \u201cconclude[d] that a trial is unfair if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.\u201d 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047; see also Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 695-96, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1851, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (listing the three bases for the Cronic presumption: (1) \u201ccomplete denial of counsel,\u201d including at a critical stage; (2) failure by counsel \u201cto subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing;\u201d and (3) \u201cwhere counsel is called upon to render assistance *1289under circumstances where competent counsel very likely could not\u201d).\nA.\nRoy contends that he was denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial when the government recommenced direct examination of Detective Longson during his counsel\u2019s absence from the courtroom. We must first decide, then, whether the portion of trial conducted in the absence of defense counsel was in fact a critical stage. Although there is no strict test or definition for a critical stage of trial, the Supreme Court, other United States Courts of Appeals, and our own precedent provide us with guideposts to help answer that question.\nIn Vines, we did not apply a Cronic presumption of prejudice when Vines\u2019s lawyer was absent during the presentation of testimony to the jury. 28 F.3d at 1128. Vines was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. Id. at 1125. The district court excused Vines\u2019s counsel on the first day of trial at 4:15 pm.1 Id. at 1125-26. During his absence, two witnesses testified. Id. at 1126. One witness testified about the arrest of Vines\u2019s co-defendant. Id. The second witness, who was part owner and operator of the warehouse where the shipment containing the cocaine was received, \u201csimply testified about leasing the space.\u201d Id. Vines was convicted of the possession charge but was acquitted of conspiracy. Id. On appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201cwe decline[d] to give birth to a rule that the taking of evidence is necessarily a critical stage of trial [and found] that no evidence directly inculpating Vines was presented during his counsel\u2019s absence.\u201d Id. at 1128. Because \u201cno evidence directly inculpating [Vines was] presented while [his] counsel [was] absent, we decline[d] to hold that counsel was absent during a critical stage of trial within the meaning of Cronic.\u201d Id.\nVines, however, does not control our analysis because counsel here was absent during the presentation of testimony directly inculpating Roy. Before counsel returned, the following evidence was admitted through the testimony of Detective Longson, a witness for the prosecution:\nQ. And how were they categorized within that general folder of \u201cMy Pictures\u201d?\nA. Those folders were categorized by date, the year first, month second, and the date third.\nQ. And were you able to determine any folders that had \u2014 or contained notable images within them?\nA. Yes. I did find folders with notable images.\nQ. And what were \u2014 what was the first folder of concern that you found?\nA. The first one I found was named \u201c2006-03-11.\u201d\nQ. And would that folder have been created by a user of that computer? A. Yes, it was.\nQ. And did you find any images within that folder?\nA. Yes, I did. I found six images.\nQ. And would you please describe the images to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury within that March 11, 2006, folder that you found?\nA. These images are a nude white female who was bound to a table by her feet with rope. The subject was laid *1290across the table and had her head covered with an orange cloth which was secured around her neck with silver duct tape.\nQ. Were you able to determine forensically how those pictures had been taken?\nA. Yes. They were taken with a Kodak v530 zoom digital camera.\nQ. And were you able to determine forensically a date and time those images were taken?\nA. Yes, I was. These were taken on March the 10th, 2005, at 6:49 p.m.\nThat testimony, given during counsel\u2019s absence, established the date on which some images at issue were created, that the folders in which they were contained would \u201chave been created by a user of that computer,\u201d and the content of those images. The district court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the possession counts included the following:\nThe Defendant can be found guilty of [possession of child pornography] only if all the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt: [(1)] [t]he Defendant knowingly possessed a visual depiction; [(2)] [t]hat the depiction was shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means including a computer or that was produced using material that had been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or foreign commerce; [(3)] [t]hat producing the visual depiction involved the use of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; [(4)] [t]hat the depiction is of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; and [(5)] [t]hat the Defendant knew that at least one performer was a minor and knew that the depiction showed the minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\nThe evidence presented to the jury during counsel\u2019s absence, therefore, provided a basis for conviction on those jury instructions. The testimony that \u201ca user of that computer\u201d would have created the folders containing the pornographic images supports the conclusion that Roy \u201cknowingly possessed a visual depiction.\u201d The identification of the date on which the images were created, when combined with Detective Longson\u2019s later identification of the subject\u2019s date of birth, and the description of the content of the images supported the third, fourth, and fifth elements \u2014 that the images \u201cinvolved the use of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct;\u201d that they were \u201cof a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct;\u201d and that Roy \u201cknew that [they] showed the minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d\nThus, this case is markedly different from our prior decision in Vines. Here, the government presented the jury with directly inculpatory evidence on a count for which Roy was ultimately convicted while his attorney was absent from the courtroom. In Vines, the government did not present evidence of Vines\u2019s own wrongdoing, and he was acquitted on the conspiracy charge, severing any potential imputation of his co-defendants\u2019 wrongdoing to him. 28 F.3d at 1126, 1128 (\u201cUpon review of the record, we find that no evidence directly inculpating Vines was presented during his counsel\u2019s absence. Where, as in this case, no evidence directly inculpating a defendant is presented while that defendant\u2019s counsel is absent, we decline to hold that counsel was absent during a critical stage of trial within the meaning of Cronic.\u201d)', cf. United States v. Russell, 205 F.3d 768, 772 (5th Cir.2000) (distinguishing the case presented, in which evidence directly inculpating only Russell\u2019s co-conspirators was presented during counsel\u2019s absence, from Vines because Russell was convicted of conspiracy, while Vines was acquitted of the conspira*1291cy charge). Hence, we must decide whether the presentation of directly inculpatory testimony materially distinguishes this case from Vines and constitutes a critical stage of a criminal trial.\nWhether a portion of trial is critical is a categorical question; it is not the unique facts of a particular trial that decide the issue but the nature of the stage. See Van v. Jones, 475 F.3d 292, 301-02 (6th Cir.2007) (emphasizing the \u201caceentu-at[ion of] the categorical nature of [the critical stage] inquiry\u201d); Burdine v. Johnson, 262 F.3d 336, 347 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cTo justify a particular stage as critical, the Court has not required the defendant to explain how having counsel would have altered the outcome of his specific case. Rather, the Court has looked to whether the substantial rights of a defendant may be affected during that type of proceeding.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Hunter v. Moore, 304 F.3d 1066, 1070 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding that closing argument is categorically a critical stage).\nOne working definition of a critical stage for purposes of Cronic is that set forth by the Sixth Circuit in Van after it considered a quintet of Supreme Court opinions as well as one of its own: whether \u201ca reasonable likelihood that [substantial prejudice to the defendant\u2019s rights] will arise from complete absence of counsel.\u201d 475 F.3d at 313. The Supreme Court opinions on which Van relied hold that a critical stage arises when \u201c[available defenses may be ... irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted,\u201d Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 54, 82 S.Ct. 157, 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961), \u201cwhere rights are preserved or lost,\u201d White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 60, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 1051, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963) (per curiam), \u201cwhenever necessary to assure a meaningful \u2018defence,\u2019 \u201d United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 225, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1931, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), where \u201c \u2018potential substantial prejudice to defendant\u2019s rights inheres in the ... confrontation and the ability of counsel to help avoid that prejudice,\u2019 \u201d Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 9, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 2003, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970) (alteration in Coleman) (quoting Wade, 388 U.S. at 227, 87 S.Ct. at 1932), and when the stage holds \u201csignificant consequences for the accused,\u201d Bell, 535 U.S. at 696, 122 S.Ct. at 1851. See Van, 475 F.3d at 312.\nConsideration of these precedents, as well as the Sixth Circuit\u2019s helpful standard, convinces us that Roy\u2019s counsel was absent during a critical stage of his trial. It is clear that there exists \u201ca reasonable likelihood that [substantial prejudice to the defendant\u2019s rights] will arise from complete absence of counsel\u201d during the presentation of directly inculpatory testimony to the jury. Van, 475 F.3d at 313. The absence of counsel during the presentation of inculpatory evidence used by the government to convict the defendant eliminates the opportunity to decide whether to lodge an objection and how to frame the objection, as well as the ability to conduct cross-examination. See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (\u201c[D]eni[al of] the right of effective cross-examination [is] constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, a defendant may irretrievably lose available defenses and rights during direct testimony of a prosecution witness. See Hamilton, 368 U.S. at 54, 82 S.Ct. at 159; White, 373 U.S. at 60, 83 S.Ct. at 1051. The presence of counsel during the examination of an adverse witness is \u201cnecessary to assure a meaningful \u2018defence.\u2019 \u201d See Wade, 388 U.S. at 225, 87 S.Ct. at 1931.\nThe present case presents a circumstance substantially similar to the Sixth *1292Circuit decision in Green v. Arn, 809 F.2d 1257 (6th Cir.), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 484 U.S. 806, 108 S.Ct. 52, 98 L.Ed.2d 17 (1987), reinstated on remand, 839 F.2d 300 (6th Cir.1988). In Green, a habeas corpus petitioner had been jointly tried with two other co-defendants. Id. at 1259. The co-defendants were represented by a separate lawyer than that of Ms. Green. Id. Green\u2019s lawyer \u201cwas absent during a critical part of the afternoon\u201d of the trial, and although co-counsel was present, Green\u2019s lawyer was not.2 Id. at 1259-61. During Green\u2019s lawyer\u2019s absence, co-defendants\u2019 counsel conducted cross-examination of a prosecution witness. Id. at 1259. Green was convicted of kidnapping and gross sexual imposition. Id. Affirming the grant of a writ of habeas corpus, the Sixth Circuit determined that \u201c[t]he presumption that counsel\u2019s assistance is essential requires us to conclude that a trial is unfair if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.\u201d Id. at 1263 (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047). The Sixth Circuit went even further to say that \u201cif counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing, then there has been a denial of Sixth Amendment rights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable\u201d. Id. (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047). And when the Sixth Amendment claim is, as here, \u201cthe denial, rather than the ineffective assistance, of counsel, the criminal defendant need only show that counsel was absent during a critical stage of the proceedings in order to establish the constitutional violation. Absence from the proceedings is deficient performance as a matter of law, and prejudice is presumed.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\nB.\nThe Fifth Circuit agrees that Cronic prejudice arises when the defendant is deprived of the presence of counsel during the presentation of inculpatory testimony to the jury. In Russell, the defendant was charged with and convicted of (1) conspiracy to possess cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute, and (2) conspiracy to launder money that was the proceeds of a drug transaction. 205 F.3d at 769. Russell\u2019s attorney was absent for two days of a joint trial while ill without Russell\u2019s waiver. Id. at 769-70, 771. Counsel for a co-defendant volunteered to sit in for Russell\u2019s counsel, and \u201c[t]he district court instructed the government not to call any witness relevant to Russell\u201d while Russell\u2019s counsel was absent. Id. 769-70. During counsel\u2019s absence, none of the testimony presented \u201cdirectly implicated Russell,\u201d but evidence relating to the conspiracy, which detailed the coconspirators\u2019 attempts to launder money and import marijuana, was introduced. Id. at 770. Prior to the absence of counsel, the government had presented evidence \u201cabout Russell\u2019s management of the distribution of marijuana operations and involvement in providing [a co-conspirator] with funds.\u201d Id. The evidence presented during counsel\u2019s absence therefore \u201cflowed directly from Russell\u2019s role in the money laundering conspiracy to the roles of [his co-conspirators] in the same money laundering conspiracy and the overall conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana.\u201d Id. Russell filed a motion to vacate the sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. Id. at 769. Although declining to adopt a \u201cbright line rule that the taking of *1293any evidence at trial in the absence of counsel is prejudicial per se,\u201d3 id. at 771, the Fifth Circuit determined that counsel was denied at a critical stage and that the Cronic presumption applied because \u201cRussell [was] without counsel as the probability of his guilt increased during the government\u2019s presentation of evidence against his co-conspirators,\u201d id. at 772. Russell\u2019s conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Id. at 773.\nHere, as in Russell, \u201cthe probability of [Roy\u2019s] guilt increased during the government\u2019s presentation of evidence,\u201d Russell, 205 F.3d at 772, and \u201c[i]t is difficult to perceive a more critical stage of a trial than the taking of evidence on the defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d Green, 809 F.2d at 1263. At Roy\u2019s trial, evidence admitted to prove that Roy knowingly possessed photographs of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct was presented to the jury during his lawyer\u2019s absence from the courtroom. The absence constitutes \u201ccircumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046. We therefore find that Roy was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a critical stage of his trial and that Cronic requires a reversal of his convictions.\nC.\nTypically, where an appellant demonstrates constitutional error, an appellate court will not disturb a conviction if the government is able to show that the error \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Courts applying the Cronic presumption of prejudice where counsel was denied at a critical stage have reached varying conclusions regarding the applicability of harmless error review under those circumstances. Compare Siverson v. O\u2019Leary, 764 F.2d 1208, 1217-19 (7th Cir.1985) (applying harmless error review to Cronic error), with Green, 809 F.2d at 1263 (failing to apply harmless error review to the facts before it). We, however, have previously held that \u201cstructural error exists where counsel is \u2018prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Arbolaez, 450 F.3d 1283, 1295 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659 n. 25, 104 S.Ct. at 2047 n. 25). Structural error is not subject to harmless error review. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 309, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (Rehnquist, C.J., maj. op.) (\u201cThese are structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards.\u201d); Vines, 28 F.3d at 1129 (\u201cTrial errors are subject to harmless-error analysis; structural defects are not.\u201d).\nAs we have stated, Cronic error is structural. \u201c[A]ny deprivation of assistance of counsel constitutes reversible error and necessitates a new trial. Our rule does not include a harmless error analysis. Cronic and Strickland4 make clear that where actual or constructive denial of assistance of counsel occurs a per se rule of prejudice applies.\u201d Crutchfield v. Wainwright, 803 F.2d 1103, 1108 (11th Cir.1986) (en banc) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Cronic error necessitates a per se reversal. See Smith *1294v. Wainwright, 777 F.2d 609, 616 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cWhere, however, a petitioner demonstrates that circumstances surrounding his representation give rise to a presumption of prejudice, he will prevail.\u201d (citing Cronic, 466 U.S. at 657 n. 20, 104 S.Ct. at 2046 n. 20)); Harding v. Davis, 878 F.2d 1341, 1345-46 (11th Cir.1989) (reversing after finding Cronic error without conducting harmless error review); Hunter, 304 F.3d at 1070 (\u201c[Djenial of counsel at a critical stage ... warrants reversal without a specific showing of prejudice.\u201d); Darden v. United States, 708 F.3d 1225, 1228 (11th Cir.), cert. denied \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2871, 186 L.Ed.2d 922 (2013) (\u201cWhen [denial of counsel at a critical stage or other Cronic error] occurs, the reviewing court presumes the defendant was prejudiced and his conviction is in turn vacated.\u201d).\nDespite other Circuits\u2019 willingness to apply harmless error review to Cronic error generally, no Circuit has applied harmless error review upon a finding that a defendant was deprived of his lawyer during the presentation of inculpatory testimony to the jury and that such deprivation violated Cronic. Although the dissent makes a reference to United States v. Kaid, 502 F.3d 43 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam), Kaid has nothing to do with Cronic. The Second Circuit confined its review to \u201cwhether a defense attorney\u2019s purported twenty-minute absence from the courtroom during a testimonial phase of a criminal trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Id. at 44 (emphasis added). In other words, the Second Circuit worked under Strickland\u2019s framework, not Cronic\u2019s. Id. at 46-47.\nIn Green, the Sixth Circuit considered \u201cwhether harmless error analysis is appropriate where a petitioner demonstrates she was unrepresented by counsel for a critical period of time during the taking of evidence against her at trial.\u201d Green, 809 F.2d at 1258. Green was tried jointly with two other co-defendants who were represented by separate counsel. Id. at 1259. Green was represented by her retained counsel. Id. Although her lawyer was present during a portion of the afternoon session of a day of her trial, he was absent during a critical part of the afternoon. Id. As the Sixth Circuit stated, \u201cthe present case is one where a harmless error inquiry should be foreclosed. It is difficult to perceive a more critical stage of a trial than the taking of evidence on the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Id. at 1263. Further stated: \u201cThe absence of counsel during the taking of evidence on the defendant\u2019s guilt is prejudicial per se and justifies an automatic grant of the writ \u2018without any opportunity for a harmless error inquiry.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Siverson, 764 F,2d at 1217 n. 6).\nThe Seventh and District of Columbia Circuits have likewise determined that harmless error review is inappropriate when counsel is denied at certain critical stages. See Siverson, 764 F.2d at 1217 n. 6 (\u201cWe recognize that the lack of counsel at some critical stages may be considered prejudicial per se, and may result in automatic reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions without any opportunity for a harmless error inquiry.\u201d); United States v. Decoster, 624 F.2d 196, 256 (D.C.Cir.1976) (en banc) (\u201cThus, where the defendant had no counsel at all at a critical stage of his trial, automatic reversal of his conviction is usually in order.\u201d).\nHarmless error review in a case like this one would be an exacting and problematic undertaking. First, as a reviewing court, we could not accurately determine whether and to what extent counsel\u2019s absence prejudiced the defendant. See David A. Moran, Don\u2019t Worry, I\u2019ll Be Right Back: Temporary Absences of Counsel During Criminal Trials and the *1295Rule of Automatic Reversal, 85 Neb. L.Rev. 186, 207-09 (2006). It would be difficult, if not impossible, for us as a reviewing court to discern, on a cold record, the reaction of the jury to the evidence presented and, therefore, to what extent counsel may have been able to react in a manner that would improve his client\u2019s likelihood of acquittal had he been present in the courtroom. See id. at 207 (\u201cDuring an ongoing trial, real-world trial counsel make crucial decisions based on the reaction of the jury to testimony, evidence, argument, and other courtroom proceedings.\u201d). In other words, harmless error review under these circumstances either would give a defendant no meaningful opportunity to challenge his conviction for denial of counsel during presentation of inculpatory evidence or would require us to ignore relevant considerations simply because they cannot be discerned from the record. See id. at 209.\nUpon his return to the courtroom, Roy\u2019s counsel failed to lodge an objection to the admission of the evidence that he missed. Of course, he could not have known what evidence he missed, as he was absent. The contemporaneous objection rule ordinarily requires a party to object to the introduction of evidence at the time it is introduced. Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-29, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Failure to do so subjects that evidentiary ruling to plain error review. Fed. R.Crim. P. 52(b); Puckett, 556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. at 1429. However, plain error review is inapplicable in this context. As Cronic notes, defense counsel\u2019s presence is assured \u201cnot for its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial,\u201d e.g., to ensure that someone is present to prevent the improper introduction of evidence. 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046; cf. Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 204, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1261, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhy excuse a judge\u2019s breach of judicial duty just because a lawyer has fallen down in his own ethics or is short on competence? Transforming the factually sufficient trigger of a formal objection into a legal necessity for responding to any breach of judicial duty is irrational.... The objection requirement works elsewhere because the objecting lawyer believes that he sights an error being committed by the judge or opposing counsel. That is hardly the motive to depend on when the risk of error, if there is one, is being created by the lawyer himself....\u201d (citation omitted)); Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 265 n. 5, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 1100 n. 5, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981) (holding that it was appropriate to consider a conflict issue not raised below because (1) defense counsel might be hesitant to raise it; (2) the government had to have been aware of the error; and (3) the record indicated that there might be such an issue). The Fifth Circuit did not apply plain error review in Russell, 205 F.3d at 772-73, even though \u201c[t]he district court did not speak to Russell or ask for his consent to the\u201d absence, and counsel \u201cdid not question anything that took place in his absence,\u201d id. at 770. Further, we have refused to subject Cronic error to plain error review even where counsel remained silent when the judge directed a verdict against the defendant, a blatant constitutional error. See Harding, 878 F.2d at 1345-46.5 Therefore, plain error review is not applicable under these circumstances.\n*1296Where, as here, structural error has occurred, the entire trial is unfair and the convictions as to all counts are tainted. See Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10, 111 S.Ct. at 1265. The Supreme Court has defined structural errors as those where the reviewing court \u201ccan only engage in pure speculation\u201d about what the jury might have done; their consequences are \u201cnecessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate.\u201d Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 281-82, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2082-83, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993). Structural errors are \u201cmarkedly different\u201d from trial errors (which can be \u201cquantitatively assessed\u201d), and thus, structural errors \u201cdefy analysis by harmless-error standards.\u201d Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 308, 309, 111 S.Ct. at 1264-65 (internal quotation marks omitted). There are some errors that courts can accurately measure and hold harmless. This is not one of them. Especially here, where the charges are interrelated and evidence relevant to one count may have influenced the jury as to others.\nIII.\nWe pause to address the concerns expressed by our dissenting colleague in his forceful dissent:\nFirst, while maintaining that there was no Cronic error at all, the dissent suggests that even if counsel\u2019s absence taints the conviction as to Counts 2-5, we can separate out the evidence as to each count. Therefore, Count 1, for which Roy received a life sentence, was unaffected by the evidence received during counsel\u2019s absence as to Counts 2-5.\nBut the government asked the jury to do the complete opposite at Roy\u2019s trial. Roy was charged in Count 1 with enticing or attempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity. Counts 2-5 charged him with possession of child pornography on his computer which, according to the government\u2019s evidence, he viewed a couple of days before traveling to the Waffle House in Kissimmee, Florida, where his attempt to entice a minor allegedly occurred. As the government stated in its closing argument:\nWell, we know where he went, ladies and gentlemen, and I submit to you we know what he was ultimately planning to do, because his interest starts a couple days before.\nYou\u2019ll recall the evidence. He\u2019s accessing his girl\u2019s folder on the laptop, he\u2019s accessing his Lily folder on the laptop.... All that adds up to is little girls, ladies and gentlemen. You got a teacher sitting here that\u2019s interested in little girls, because that\u2019s all he\u2019s got saved in his collection. He\u2019s got it all backed up so if anything ever crashes, he\u2019s got it in disk form, he\u2019s got it in thumbnail form. That\u2019s what he\u2019s interested in, and that wasn\u2019t entrapment, because he was into little girls a long time before he ever showed up in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nYou know it because that\u2019s what he likes to look at on the Internet, as well.\n\nLater in his closing argument, the prosecutor continued to invite the jury to consider evidence admitted as to Counts 2-5 in connection with Count 1 as well:\nHe was predisposed. You know that from all of these videos and pictures he likes to watch.\nAs Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote in Fulminante, a \u201cstructural defect affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply [acting as] an error in the trial process itself.... [Where structural error exists] a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence, and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u201d 499 U.S. at 310, 111 S.Ct. at 1265 (internal quota*1297tion marks omitted); see also Vines, 28 F.3d at 1129 (\u201c[Structural defects ... involve deprivations of constitutional protections so basic that in their absence no criminal trial can be deemed reliable, nor any punishment fundamentally fair.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). To examine the evidence separately as to each count when counsel has been denied makes little sense because we would have to speculate about what evidence the jury may have applied in its deliberations as to each individual count, especially in a case like this one, where the charges are interrelated and evidence relevant to one count may have influenced the jury as to others.\nNext, the dissent suggests that this case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine the circumstances surrounding counsel\u2019s absence from the courtroom during the presentation of evidence against Roy. Although Judge Boggs\u2019s dissent in Green (which reflects an almost identical yet condensed version of the dissent that follows this opinion) made the same suggestion, the majority in Green \u201cdeeline[d] the State\u2019s invitation to remand for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d 809 F.2d at 1261. The majority found that \u201c[although it may be that some absences by a criminal defendant\u2019s attorney might be so de min-imis that there would be no constitutional significance, the instant record unequivocally demonstrates that [Green\u2019s attorney\u2019s] absence was not de minimis. In our view, the record permits but one conclusion: [Green\u2019s] constitutional right to counsel was implicated by [Green\u2019s lawyer\u2019s] absence.\u201d Id. at 1261-62. Contrary to the dissent, we do not state a blanket rule requiring automatic reversal on the occasion of any absence of counsel from the courtroom during the presentation of evidence against the defendant at his trial. But here, the absence of Roy\u2019s counsel from the courtroom during the presentation of direct inculpatory testimony by a deputy sheriff who was the government\u2019s computer forensic specialist expert witness cannot reasonably be considered a de min-imis constitutional violation.\nIn fact, Judge Boggs, the dissenter in Green, would seem to join the majority in this ease. As Judge Boggs concedes, \u201c[t]he facts of this case are a long way from, for an extreme example, taking of direct testimony against a single defendant whose counsel is absent.\u201d Id. at 1265 (Boggs, J., dissenting).\nOur dissenting colleague next suggests that Roy\u2019s counsel \u201cmay have deliberately taken advantage of his own tardiness and carefully avoided any attempt to correct the problem, hoping that he could have a get-out-of-jail-free card in his pocket for his client. If so, it worked.\u201d6 Further, the dissent says that counsel may have \u201cdeliberately engineered the whole thing\u201d and that our decision today could invite misconduct by opportunistic counsel, which, according to the dissent, is prevalent in the three states of the Eleventh Circuit as reflected by statistics evidencing rampant lawyer misconduct in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama by criminal lawyers.\nOur confidence in the integrity of lawyers, who are admitted to practice in our courtrooms as officers of the Court bound by rules of professional responsibility, satisfies us that our decision today will not go so far as to motivate them to place their licenses to practice law in jeopardy by, as the dissent suggests, strategically slipping *1298out of the courtroom when the judge is not looking and when they think inculpatory evidence is coming, to invite reversible error in the event of a conviction. Nor does the parade of horribles imagined by the dissent permit us to disregard Cronic.\nThe dissent also maintains that judges are not like, in its words, \u201ckindergarten teachers, [who] will be forced to keep an eye on their lawyer-children.\u201d Contrary to that view, we are unpersuaded that United States District Judges should be excused from the less than onerous burden of ensuring that the defendant\u2019s lawyer is seated at counsel table, next to his client, or is somewhere in the courtroom when the government seeks the admission of incriminating evidence that will be used by the jury to convict his client of a felony, resulting in life imprisonment. Especially in a trial with a single defendant who has a single lawyer.\nWe conclude that when the accused is deprived of his lawyer at a critical stage of his trial, there has been a denial of Sixth Amendment rights that makes the adversary process itself unreliable. The Constitution gives the defendant the right to \u201cthe guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.\u201d Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s absence during the admission of incul-patory evidence against Roy at his trial is \u201c \u2018constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u2019 \u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047 (emphasis added) (quoting Alaska, 415 U.S. at 318, 94 S.Ct. at 1111).\nAlthough we reverse and remand for a new trial, a reversal does not mean that the defendant goes free. Rather, Roy will be retried in accordance with the rules of evidence and procedure, and without constitutional error.\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse Roy\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n. We did not decide whether Vines waived his right to counsel because, after determining that his counsel\u2019s absence was a trial error rather than a structural defect, we decided any constitutional deprivation was harmless. Vines, 28 F.3d at 1129-31.\n\n\n. Notably, the absence may have been as short as five minutes, as the government argued; Green asserted that it was nearly two hours long. Green, 809 F.2d at 1265 (Boggs, J., dissenting).\n\n\n.Compare this with our conclusion in Vines: \u201c[W]e decline to give birth to a rule that the taking of evidence is necessarily a critical stage of trial\u201d where \"no evidence directly inculpating Vines was presented during his counsel\u2019s absence.\u201d 28 F.3d at 1128.\n\n\n. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).\n\n\n. Notably, in Harding, though the directed verdict was likely reversible plain error, see Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 578, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 3106, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986), we reversed for Cronic error, not for the directed verdict. See Harding, 878 F.2d at 1345-46.\n\n\n. Counsel is so clever, says the dissent, that he may have deliberately arranged the services of another lawyer to argue this appeal rather than having to admit at oral argument that he orchestrated the entire Cronic violation. The dissent infers too much to support such a conclusion.\n\n",

            "opinion_text": "\nED CARNES, Chief Judge,\ndissenting:\nReturning late from a lunch break on the third day of a six-day trial, defense counsel missed a small part of the testimony of the twelfth of thirteen government witnesses. He was out of the courtroom for only seven of the 1,884 minutes, or 31.4 hours, of the trial (not counting recesses and jury deliberations), which amounts to less than one-half of one percent of the trial time. During his absence counsel missed only 18 answers out of a total of approximately 2,745 answers that were given by government witnesses during the trial, which means counsel missed less than one percent of the total number of answers given by witnesses for the prosecution. That\u2019s it. And all of the testimony that he missed was repeated in even more detail by the same witness after counsel returned to the courtroom.\nSo far as it appears from the record, the judge and the prosecutor did not notice defense counsel\u2019s brief absence. When he returned to the courtroom, counsel did not object to testimony having been taken in his absence. He did not ask the court to strike the questions and answers that he had missed and instruct the jury to disregard them. He apparently did not seek to have the questions and answers he missed read back to him outside the presence of the jury so that he could familiarize himself with them and object to any that were objectionable. For all that we can tell, counsel may have deliberately taken advantage of his own tardiness and carefully avoided any attempt to correct the prob*1299lem, hoping that he could have a get-out-of-jail-free card in his pocket for his client. If so, it worked. The majority decides that the defendant\u2019s convictions for attempted child enticement and for possession of child pornography, most of which the defendant produced himself, must be set aside because of his counsel\u2019s brief absence, even though the record conclusively establishes that the absence could not possibly have prejudiced the defendant.\nAt oral argument, we could not ask the defendant\u2019s trial counsel about the facts surrounding his absence from the courtroom, why he did not object, if he made any off-the-record effort to familiarize himself with the testimony taken in his absence, or anything else about the matter. The reason we could not ask what really happened, and why, is that trial counsel conveniently did not represent the defendant on appeal. Another attorney did. We could have remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to find out all of the facts, but the majority refused my request to do that. The majority is content with only a swift sideways glance at the facts because it thinks the facts can be presumed away. But \u201c[t]his is not a matter for polite [or impolite] presumptions; we must look the facts in the face.\u201d Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 349, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting).\nThe majority\u2019s view, now the law of this circuit, is that if a witness gives any testimony at all, even a single answer, supporting any count against the defendant while the defendant\u2019s attorney is outside the courtroom, reversal of every count of conviction is automatic. No matter what. Reversal is automatic regardless of the reason for the absence. Regardless of whether the trial judge or prosecutor noticed the absence. Regardless of whether the answer given during the absence was objectionable. Regardless of whether the defendant suffered any actual prejudice from counsel\u2019s absence. Regardless of whether counsel failed to object or seek any kind of corrective action. Regardless of whether counsel made a strategic decision not to seek to correct the problem. Regardless of whether the first mention of the matter was on appeal. And regardless of whether counsel deliberately engineered the whole thing. In other words, absence plus any inculpatory answer equals reversal regardless of any and all other facts and circumstances.\nThe majority holds that no matter how strong the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, all a defense attorney has to do to guarantee an automatic reversal of his client\u2019s conviction on any and all counts is to be outside the courtroom while a witness gives a single inculpatory answer on any count against his client. The attorney can keep quiet about it until he sees what the verdict is and then claim his right to have any convictions set aside. And under today\u2019s decision they must be set aside.\nIn fact, under the majority\u2019s holding, it does not even matter if the attorney upon returning to the courtroom does object and does seek corrective action because as soon as a single answer is given in his absence an absolute, conclusive, irrebutta-ble presumption of prejudice arises. Nothing can be done. The law today\u2019s decision puts in place is that absence during any inculpatory testimony at all is all that matters; no prejudice is required, no inquiry is allowed, no cure is permitted. Of course I dissent.\nBecause the facts do matter under a proper view of the law, Part I of this opinion summarizes the facts in order to show how defense counsel\u2019s brief absence could not possibly have prejudiced Roy on any count. Part II explains why any claim *1300of error concerning Roy\u2019s trial is not Cronic error, and why the majority\u2019s unprecedented decision to the contrary is an extreme outlier. Part III addresses the far reaching effects of this decision. Part IV lays out how we should have resolved this case. It explains why any claim of error regarding defense counsel\u2019s momentary absence should be subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, and given the failure to object, should be reviewed only for plain error. Applying that standard, each of Roy\u2019s five convictions should be affirmed because he cannot even come close to showing that his lawyer\u2019s seven-minute absence, which amounted to less than one-half of one percent of the trial\u2019s total length, prejudicially affected his substantial rights. Part IV also points out that even if we put aside the failure to object and do not restrict our review to plain error, any error still would not be reversible because it was harmless.\nI. The Facts of the Matter\nThe transcripts of Roy\u2019s trial show that, during its case-in-chief, the government questioned 13 witnesses who provided approximately 2,745 answers to questions while on the witness stand. Defense counsel was out of the courtroom for only 18 of those answers and was present to hear 2,727 of them. The 18 answers that he missed were given during a seven-minute period in a trial that lasted 31.4 hours, not counting recesses and jury deliberations. To put it in context, defense counsel was out during less than one-half of one percent of the trial time; he was out during less than one percent of the testimony that was given by the government\u2019s thirteen witnesses. Every answer given while counsel was absent was repeated by the same witness after counsel returned, and trial counsel objected to none of that testimony when it was reiterated in his presence.\nTo understand why defense counsel\u2019s brief absence did not prejudice Roy, it is important to consider the five charges against him. Count 1 was different in kind from Counts 2-5. Count 1 charged Roy with attempted child enticement, based on his efforts to arrange a sexual encounter with a fictitious 13-year-old girl in response to an internet ad posted by law enforcement. That charge did not involve any child pornography. And not a single question was asked about that charge during counsel\u2019s absence.\nCounts 2-5 did involve child pornography. Each of those four counts charged Roy with knowingly possessing \u201cany visual depiction\u201d of child pornography, and the same pornographic photographs and videos of minors were apparently used to prove each count. The difference in the counts is based on the four different electronic devices Roy used to store those images: his desktop computer (Count 2); his laptop computer (Count 3); his USB thumb drive (Count 4); and three of his CDs (Count 5). The statutory basis for each of those four counts, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), (b)(2), required just one image, but the evidence proved without dispute that there were multiple pornographic photographs and videos of multiple minors on each of the four devices. Each count was proven many times over.\nA. The Testimony Presented During the First Two-and-a-Half Days of Trial Before Defense Counsel\u2019s Absence\nDuring the first two days of the trial, with defense counsel present at all times, the government called ten witnesses who provided testimony focused almost exclusively on the attempted child enticement charge in Count 1. That testimony showed that Roy, a middle school teacher, ar*1301ranged a sexual encounter that he thought would involve a 13-year-old girl and her mother, and he drove to a prearranged location to meet them so that he could have sex with the girl. The testimony also showed that Roy went to the liaison prepared \u2014 with condoms and lubricant in his pockets. Roy\u2019s lawyer was in the courtroom for the entirety of those first two days of trial and for the presentation of all of the testimony and evidence about Count 1. He did not miss anything about Count 1 on those or any other days. Yet the majority reverses that count of conviction anyway.\nOn the third day of trial, before the lunch break and in counsel\u2019s presence, there was some additional testimony about Count 1, including the fact that Roy had traveled more than an hour to get to the meeting place for the purpose of having sex with a 13-year-old girl. Much of the testimony that morning, however, went to Counts 2-5 and concerned Roy\u2019s sexual relationship with L.B., the girl depicted in the pornographic images and videos that he had produced and stored on the four electronic devices specified in those four counts. (As I have mentioned, there was also child pornography stored on each of those devices that depicted other minors, which Roy had downloaded from the internet.)\nAlso on the morning of the third day of trial, with defense counsel present, Florida Department of Law Enforcement Agent William Kulp testified without objection that L.B. was bom on May 9, 1989. That means any pornography depicting her that was produced before May 9, 2007 is child pornography. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(1) (defining \u201cminor\u201d for this purpose as anyone under 18 years of age). The principal at the high school L.B. had attended identified photos of her in various school yearbooks, three of which were admitted into evidence without objection. The purpose of that testimony was to permit the jury to compare how L.B. looked at various ages with the depictions of her in the pornography.\nThe third and final witness to be called before the lunch break on the third day was Deputy Sheriff Charlie Longson, a computer forensics expert. In defense counsel\u2019s presence, he testified extensively about his qualifications and how he forensically examines a computer. He also testified about the user and email/messenger accounts he found on Roy\u2019s desktop computer which, among other things, was used to get into evidence Roy\u2019s email conversations setting up the sexual liaison with the 13 year old and the sexually oriented instant messenger conversations between Roy and L.B. that were on that computer. Longson\u2019s testimony was interrupted by a lunch break.\nAgain, all of the testimony recounted so far occurred during the first two-and-a-half days of the trial, while Roy\u2019s counsel was continuously present in the courtroom.\nB. The Testimony Presented During Defense Counsel\u2019s Brief Absence After Lunch on the Third Day of Trial\nDefense counsel returned late from the lunch break on that third day and missed seven minutes of the testimony of Deputy Longson. During the seven minutes counsel was out of the courtroom, Longson gave 18 answers to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. All of those 18 answers concerned only six of the numerous images of child pornography. All six of those images were of L.B. and were found in only one of the several file folders containing child pornography on Roy\u2019s desktop computer. That folder had been labeled \u201c2006-03-11.\u201d Longson testified that those six images depicted \u201ca nude white female ... bound to a table by her feet with rope\u201d and with *1302\u201can orange cloth ... secured around her neck with silver duct tape.\u201d He also testified that those six images were taken with a Kodak v530 Zoom Digital Camera on March 10, 2005, were initially uploaded onto a computer on March 11, 2006, and were then transferred to Roy\u2019s desktop computer on April 4, 2009. All of that testimony was about facts that had been disclosed to the defense two months before trial in Longson\u2019s forensic lab report. During the seven minutes while defense counsel was out, no exhibits were admitted into evidence and Longson did not identify L.B. as the female in the pornographic images.\nC. The Testimony Presented After Defense Counsel\u2019s Return to the Courtroom Following His Brief Absence\nDefense counsel returned to the courtroom following those seven minutes of testimony, which covered only three transcript pages. The prosecutor then continued questioning Longson for 69 more pages of the transcript, he was cross-examined by defense counsel for 45 more pages, and his re-direct testimony covers 19 more pages. Adding those numbers to Longson\u2019s 42 pages of testimony before the lunch break, his testimony spans two days and covers 133 pages of the transcript, only three pages of which occurred in defense counsel\u2019s brief .absence.\nThe testimony Longson gave during the seven minutes defense counsel was not there, all of which concerned only six of the multiple images of child pornography, was repeated immediately after counsel returned to the courtroom. After defense counsel entered the courtroom, the prosecutor approached Longson with 10 exhibits that included, among others, the six images Longson had found in the \u201c2006-03-11\u201d folder on Roy\u2019s desktop computer. Longson then described in detail what each image depicted, and testified that they had been created on March 11, 2006, and uploaded onto Roy\u2019s desktop computer on April 4, 2009. Those images showed the then-16-year-old L.B. \u201cbound to a table by her feet with a ... red and white ski rope\u201d; she was wearing an \u201corange hood across her head with silver duct tape secured around the neck\u201d; there was a \u201cdildo inserted in her vagina\u201d and \u201ca male\u2019s penis ... suspended above [her] body.\u201d (A few pages later in the transcript, Longson repeated his earlier testimony that all of the images of L.B. on Roy\u2019s desktop had been taken with a Kodak v530 Zoom Digital Camera.) At the time those images of L.B. were taken, she was a minor for purposes of the child pornography charges against Roy in Counts 2-5 because she was under 18 years of age. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(1). The ten images were admitted into evidence without objection while defense counsel was present.\nBeing present during all of the testimony recounted in the preceding paragraph, Roy\u2019s trial counsel had an opportunity to object to the testimony or admission of the exhibits into evidence, but he did not object. Likewise, Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has not suggested any basis for objecting to the testimony or to the admission of the exhibits. Their failure to do so shows that trial counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence when the same testimony was given by the same witness earlier (and no exhibits were admitted) did not deprive the defense of an opportunity to lodge a valid objection to any testimony or evidence.\nAfter repeating in defense counsel\u2019s presence all of the testimony he had missed, Longson testified for the first time about other pornographic images of L.B. that he had found on Roy\u2019s desktop, laptop, thumb drive, and CDs. None of those other images had been mentioned in coun*1303sel\u2019s absence. With counsel present, Longson described a series of three images found on Roy\u2019s desktop in a separate file folder labeled \u201c2006-02-04,\u201d which featured L.B. lying naked in a bathtub with \u201cAlex\u2019s Little Cunt\u201d written in \u201cblack ink both on [her] chest between the breasts and then on [her] stomach over the nav[e]l.\u201d Longson testified that those images were taken on December 2, 2006, when L.B. indisputably would have been only 17 years old, which means she was a minor for purposes of the child pornography charges against Roy in Counts 2-5.\nWith defense counsel present, Longson also testified about finding on Roy\u2019s desktop and laptop numerous videos of L.B. that had been made between October and December 2006 using a Kodak v530 Zoom Digital Camera, and it was undisputed that L.B. would have been 17 years old during that time. Some of those videos showed: L.B. bound and blindfolded with a \u201cbody net covering her body\u201d and \u201ca red dildo inserted into her anus\u201d; L.B. \u201cfully nude\u201d with a \u201cdildo in her vagina\u201d while she \u201cperform[ed] fellatio on a white male\u201d; L.B. \u201cfully nude\u201d with a \u201cvibrator in her vagina\u201d while a white male \u201cattempted] to have annal [sic] sex with her\u201d; L.B. performing fellatio after removing a \u201cschoolgirl outfit\u201d; L.B. having sexual intercourse with a man while she was tied up; and L.B. lying \u201cnude in [a] bathtub\u201d with \u201cAlex\u2019s little cunt\u201d scrawled across her chest and stomach while a man urinated on her.\nLongson described each of those videos and they were admitted into evidence. Although defense counsel was present during all of that testimony and admission of exhibits, he never objected to any of it. And Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has not suggested to us that there was any basis for objecting to that testimony or to the admission of those videos into evidence.\nLongson\u2019s testimony about the child pornography he found on Roy\u2019s desktop, laptop, USB drive, and CDs was not limited to images and videos of L.B. Longson also testified about finding several images of downloaded child pornography in temporary internet files on Roy\u2019s desktop computer, as well as pornographic images of minors stored elsewhere on his electronic devices, including files named \u201cKing-pouge_14,\u201d \u201cVica_16,\u201d and \u201cSvet_16.\u201d Longson specifically described how one of those images showed \u201ctwo or three subjects under the age of 18 engaged in sexual activity with two men.\u201d These were images of minors other than L.B., and they were admitted into evidence. Although he was present during all of that testimony, defense counsel never objected to any of it, and Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has not suggested to us any ground for keeping it out.\nThe importance of the unrefuted testimony and evidence about the child pornography involving minors other than L.B., all of which was admitted while defense counsel was present, is that any one of those images was enough by itself to prove each of the charges contained in Counts 2-5, because all the statute requires is one \u201cvisual depiction\u201d of child pornography. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4). That means that even if all of the testimony involving L.B. were struck from the record because defense counsel was out of the courtroom while a small part of that testimony was first given, the Count 2-5 charges against Roy were still conclusively proven. They were conclusively proven by the testimony and other evidence concerning child pornography depicting minors other than L.B., all of which came in during counsel\u2019s presence.\nOnce the prosecution completed its direct examination of Longson, defense counsel thoroughly and vigorously cross-examined him over the course of 45 pages *1304of the trial transcript. Counsel attempted to challenge Longson\u2019s testimony that the photographs and videos of L.B. were created when she was under the age of 18. His challenge fell short, however, because Longson explained that data embedded in the photographs and videos of L.B. showed that they had been taken with a Kodak digital camera on a date when L.B. was a minor. Significantly, defense counsel did not even attempt during cross-examination or elsewhere to challenge Longson\u2019s testimony about the pornographic images involving minors other than L.B., and any one of those images on the devices was enough to convict Roy on Counts 2-5.\nOn the fourth day of trial, the government called its last witness and then rested. The defense called a few witnesses, including Robert Deane Moody, its own computer forensics expert. He testified that there were reported problems with the battery life of the Kodak camera model that Roy had used to produce the images of L.B., which would cause the camera\u2019s internal clock to reset to its default date and time if the camera\u2019s battery went dead. If the internal clock in the camera used to create the images of L.B. had reset, it was possible that the creation dates that Deputy Longson had noted for the L.B. images and videos might be inaccurate. Moody conceded, however, that the problems were not necessarily present in all of those models of the Kodak camera and that Roy\u2019s may not have had any battery issues anyway. He admitted that the names of the computer folders in which the L.B. images were stored (i.e., \u201c2006-03-11\u201d and \u201c2006-10-13\u201d) were all consistent with the creation dates that the camera had embedded in those images. He also admitted that the images and videos were numbered sequentially and showed no signs of reverting back to an earlier date. And none of his testimony concerned the numerous other images of child pornography that were found on Roy\u2019s four electronic devices, any one of which was enough to prove his guilt.\nII. Defense Counsel\u2019s Absence for Less Than One-Half of One Percent of the Trial Was Not Cronic Error\nThis part proceeds in four sections to explain why Cronic\u2019s presumption of prejudice does not apply in this case. Section A reviews the Cronic decision and related Supreme Court precedent and shows how trial counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence during a six-day trial is far removed from the narrow and extreme circumstances in which the Cronic presumption is appropriate. Section B discusses the meaning of a \u201ccritical stage,\u201d a meaning vital to consideration of Cronic in this case, and explains how the majority\u2019s extreme definition of \u201cstage\u201d runs counter to common sense and precedent. Section C recognizes, as this Court sitting en banc has held, that Cronic\u2019s presumption is reserved for \u201conly a very narrow spectrum of cases\u201d where the adversary process is presumptively unreliable, and it explains how the record plainly shows that there is nothing unreliable about Roy\u2019s trial and his convictions. Section D discusses decisions from other circuits that have addressed whether Cronic applies to temporary absences of an attorney from trial, and it shows that today\u2019s decision is an extreme outlier. It also discusses why courts are capable of determining whether brief attorney absences are prejudicial.\nA. Supreme Court Precedent\nThe majority\u2019s conclusion that defense counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence during a six-day trial requires a presumption of prejudice is unprecedented and wrong. Cronic carved out only a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the general requirement that a defendant must affirmatively prove preju*1305dice from an error involving counsel; the presumption of prejudice it created is limited to circumstances so grave that they amount to a total failure or complete deprivation of counsel. See Vines v. United States, 28 F.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir.1994); see also United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2047, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Stano v. Dugger, 921 F.2d 1125, 1153 (11th Cir.1991) (en banc) (\u201cCronic\u2019s presumption of prejudice applies to only a very narrow spectrum of cases where the circumstances leading to counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness are so egregious that the defendant was in effect denied any meaningful assistance at all.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Those circumstances include \u201cthe complete denial of counsel\u201d at a \u201ccritical stage of [the] trial\u201d and counsel\u2019s \u201centire[] fail[ure] to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047 (emphasis added).\nFor example, the Court in Cronic cited Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961), where prejudice was presumed when the defendant was entirely denied any counsel at his arraignment, and White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963), where prejudice was presumed after the defendant was entirely denied counsel at a preliminary hearing. Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047. Here, by contrast, defense counsel was present during more than 99.5% of Roy\u2019s trial, which can hardly be characterized as the \u201ccomplete denial of counsel\u201d at a critical stage or an \u201centire[] fail[ure] to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d See id. Counsel vigorously represented Roy. Among other things, he cross-examined Deputy Longson for 45 pages of the trial transcript and called his own competing expert witness to undermine Longson\u2019s testimony.\nGiven the \u201cvery narrow spectrum of cases\u201d to which the Cronic exception to the actual prejudice requirement applies, we have held en banc that the burden of establishing that an error warrants Cronic\u2019s presumption of prejudice is \u201ca very heavy one.\u201d Stano, 921 F.2d at 1153 (quotation marks omitted). Both the difficulty of carrying that \u201cvery heavy\u201d burden and the \u201cvery narrow\u201d scope of the Cronic exception are evident from the fact that the Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to apply it. For example, the Court has held that the Cronic exception did not apply, and the usual showing of actual prejudice was required, where trial counsel failed to present any mitigating evidence or any final argument during the penalty phase of a capital trial. Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 692-98, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1849-52, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). The Court also has held that Cronic did not apply, and a showing of actual prejudice was required, where trial counsel without the defendant\u2019s consent conceded that the defendant was guilty of capital murder. Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 178, 190-91, 125 S.Ct. 551, 555, 562-63, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004). Not once in the thirty years since the Cronic decision was issued has the Supreme Court ever found that its presumptive prejudice rule applied. The scope of the rule is that narrow; the burden of showing that it applies is that heavy.\nEven in the Cronic case itself, the Court did not find that the Cronic exception applied. That case involved a woefully inexperienced, young attorney who had been appointed counsel in a complex mail fraud case only 25 days before trial, a case that the government had investigated for over four-and-a-half years during which it reviewed thousands of documents. Cronic, 466 U.S. at 649, 662-66, 104 S.Ct. at 2041, *13062049-51. Despite those extreme facts, the Court refused to presume prejudice, requiring instead that the defendant show that he actually was prejudiced. The Supreme Court\u2019s insistence on confining the Cronic exception to narrow boundaries is evident from the fact that in Bell, Nixon, and Cronic itself the Court reversed the decisions of lower courts that had presumed prejudice. See Nixon, 543 U.S. at 189-93, 125 S.Ct. at 561-63; Bell, 535 U.S. at 688, 702, 122 S.Ct. at 1847, 1854; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666-67, 104 S.Ct. at 2051. And in all of those cases, the risk of prejudice to the defendant was much greater than the risk of prejudice to Roy from his lawyer\u2019s seven-minute absence during a six-day trial.\nThe opinions in Cronic and Strickland indicate that Cronic\u2019s narrow exception to the requirement that actual prejudice be shown rests in large part on considerations of judicial economy applicable only to rare circumstances. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046 (\u201cThere are, however, circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d) (emphasis added); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. at 2067 (\u201cPrejudice in these [Cronic] circumstances is so likely that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost.\u201d) (emphasis added). The rare circumstances are those in which the likelihood of prejudice is so high that there is no point in wasting time looking into it. This case does not involve one of those rare circumstances any more than the Bell, Nixon, and Cronic eases did.\nB. A Single Inculpatory Question and Answer Does Not Qualify as a \u201cStage\u201d of a Trial\nThe majority\u2019s strategy for escaping the narrow confines of Cronic, a decision which presumes prejudice only when defense counsel is absent or not functioning as counsel for an entire stage of a criminal trial, is to fragment the meaning of \u201cstage\u201d so that any and every inculpatory answer, or any eighteen out of 2,745 of them in this case, is a separate stage of the case. While that extraordinary view serves the purpose of converting Cronic\u2019s \u201cvery narrow\u201d exception into a very broad one, it is indefensible. Under the majority\u2019s view the trial is not a stage of the case, it is instead a collection of hundreds or thousands of stages depending on its length. Every time a witness, whether a government witness on direct examination or a defense witness on cross-examination, provides an inculpatory answer, a separate stage of the trial has occurred, according to the majority. That means, in this case with 2,745 answers from witnesses for the government, the presentation of the government\u2019s case was not a stage of the case but instead was more than two thousand stages of the case. See Maj. Opn. at 1290-92. That is the only way the majority can conclude that because Roy\u2019s counsel missed 18 answers out of 2,745 that government witnesses gave, he was absent during a critical \u201cstage\u201d of the trial, or actually during eighteen critical stages.\nThe majority\u2019s definition distorts the common meaning of the word \u201cstage.\u201d See Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 1853 (2d ed. 2001) (defining \u201cstage\u201d as \u201ca particular phase, period, position, etc., in a process, development, or series\u201d). When we use the word \u201cstage\u201d in our everyday life, and throughout the law, we do not mean to refer to fleeting moments or small slices of events. Instead, we use the word to refer to larger component parts of a process that share a common characteristic. For example, adolescence is considered a stage of life; but we would never speak of every minute, hour, or day of an adolescent\u2019s life as a stage of his life. But that is what the *1307majority is doing in this case. A stage is not a stage, in its view, but instead is every small part of every single component of all the phases of a stage. That does not make sense.\nDistorting the definition of \u201cstage\u201d eviscerates Cronic\u2019s requirement that there be \u201ca complete denial of counsel\u201d \u201cat a critical stage of his trial\u201d before a presumption of prejudice applies. Cronic, 466 U.S at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047. Denial of counsel during less than one-half of one percent of a trial, for only seven minutes of a 31.4 hour-long trial, can hardly be called a \u201ccomplete denial of counsel\u201d during \u201ca critical stage\u201d of the trial. If that is \u201ca complete denial of counsel\u201d during a critical stage, what would a partial denial of counsel look like? What would denial of counsel for less than an entire stage of a trial be?\nOnly by shrinking \u201ccritical stage of [the defendant\u2019s] trial\u201d to an indefensibly tiny fraction of what it means can the majority reach the result it does in today\u2019s decision. If we defined the stage to be the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, there would not be a complete denial of counsel because Roy\u2019s attorney was absent for only a small sliver of the government\u2019s case. If we defined the stage to be the testimony of any of the government\u2019s 13 witnesses, there would not be a complete denial of counsel because Roy\u2019s attorney missed only a few answers of the testimony of one of those witnesses. Even if we fragmented \u201cstage\u201d down to the direct examination of any of the government\u2019s 13 witnesses, there would still not be a complete denial of counsel because Roy\u2019s attorney was present during the vast majority of Deputy Longson\u2019s direct examination.\nThe majority\u2019s redefinition of the word \u201cstage\u201d finds no support in the Supreme Court decisions in this area. Instead, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions show that it understands \u201cstage,\u201d as it used the term in Cronic, to mean a broader, qualitatively distinct phase of a criminal proceeding, such as a post-indictment lineup or interrogation, an arraignment, a plea or other pretrial hearing, closing arguments as a whole, and sentencing. See Missouri v. Frye, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1407, 182 L.Ed.2d 379 (2012) (plea negotiations as a critical stage); Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778, 786, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2085, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009) (post-indictment interrogation as a critical stage); Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 87, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 1387, 158 L.Ed.2d 209 (2004) (\u201cA plea hearing qualifies as a critical stage.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); Bell, 535 U.S. at 695-96, 122 S.Ct. at 1851 (noting that a \u201ccritical stage\u201d denotes \u201ca step of a criminal proceeding, such as arraignment\u201d) (emphasis added); Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1205, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) (sentencing as a critical stage); Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 863, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 2555, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975) (invalidating a statute that allowed a trial judge \u201cto deny absolutely the opportunity for any closing summation at all\u201d); Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 683, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1879, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972) (post-indictment lineup as a critical stage); Hamilton, 368 U.S. at 54-55, 82 S.Ct. at 158-59 (complete absence of counsel from the defendant\u2019s arraignment); White, 373 U.S. at 59-60, 83 S.Ct. at 1051 (complete absence of counsel from a preliminary hearing).\nThe Supreme Court has never suggested for a moment that a single inculpatory question and answer, or a handful of them, is an independent or separate \u201cstage\u201d of a criminal proceeding, nor has it ever suggested that a critical stage can, or should, be subdivided into countless sub-stages. For example, in Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 267, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1953, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), the Supreme Court *1308analyzed whether the whole process of taking handwriting exemplars qualified as a critical stage, not whether each stroke of the defendant\u2019s pen was its own distinct stage. And in United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 236-37, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1937, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), the Court decided whether a post-indictment lineup, considered as a whole, was a critical stage of criminal proceedings, not whether each glance of the witness at the defendant or other moment was itself a stage.\nToday\u2019s decision is the first time that an appellate court has subdivided a stage of criminal proceedings into hundreds or thousands of smaller stages and called them all critical. See, e.g., United States v. Ross, 703 F.3d 856, 873-74 (6th Cir.2012) (analyzing whether a competency hearing qualified as a critical stage); McNeal v. Adams, 623 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir.2010) (holding that a hearing on a motion to compel the defendant to provide a DNA sample was not a critical stage after considering several factors that might \u201cmake a proceeding a critical stage\u201d) (emphasis added); McDowell v. Kingston, 497 F.3d 757, 762-63 (7th Cir.2007) (discussing whether the complete testimony of a defendant constituted a critical stage of his trial); Harrington v. Gillis, 456 F.3d 118, 132 (3d Cir.2006) (noting that \u201can appeal is a critical stage of criminal proceedings\u201d) (emphasis added); United States v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that a \u201cplea withdrawal hearing \u201d was a critical stage) (emphasis added); United States v. Branch, 91 F.3d 699, 723 (5th Cir.1996) (analyzing whether a pre-verdict bench conference was a critical stage of the criminal proceedings); United States v. Hicks, 948 F.2d 877, 885 (4th Cir.1991) (analyzing whether \u201ca routine presentence interview \u201d qualified as a critical stage of the criminal proceedings) (emphasis added); United States v. Sayeedi, 903 F.2d 88, 91 (2d Cir.1990) (noting that jury selection is a critical stage and not analyzing whether every question asked and answer given during voir dire qualified as an independent critical stage).\nEven the decision that the majority relies on for its \u201cworking definition\u201d of a critical stage did not define \u201cstage\u201d the way the majority does. See Van v. Jones, 475 F.3d 292 (6th Cir.2007). In Van, the Sixth Circuit addressed whether a \u201cconsolidation hearing\u201d qualified as a critical stage of the proceedings against the defendant. Id. at 293. The question, as the court framed it, was not whether seven minutes of that hearing amounted to a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d Nor was the question whether a single statement made during the hearing was a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d Instead, the question in the Sixth Circuit\u2019s view was whether the entire hearing, which Van\u2019s attorney had missed, was a critical stage.\nThe majority also relies on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s en banc decision in Burdine v. Johnson for its definition of a critical stage, but in that decision the Fifth Circuit emphasized that \u201cstages\u201d are broader proceedings. 262 F.3d 336, 347 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cTo justify a particular stage as critical, the Court has not required the defendant to explain how having counsel would have altered the outcome of his specific case. Rather, the Court has looked to whether the substantial rights of a defendant may be affected during that type of proceeding.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). There is no support in either the decisions of the Supreme Court or of other federal appellate courts for the majority\u2019s extraordinary definition of a stage of a criminal proceeding for Cronic critical stage purposes.\nC. The Adversary Process of Roy\u2019s Trial Was Not Unreliable and Roy Did Not Suffer Prejudice\nAs the Supreme Court has explained, Cronic\u2019s rarely applicable presumption is *1309reserved for Sixth Amendment violations that are so serious that they \u201cmake[ ] the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047; see also Hammonds v. Newsome, 816 F.2d 611, 613 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cThis Court has stated that the presumptive prejudice approach of the Cronic dictum applies to a narrow range of cases where there is a fundamental breakdown of the adversarial process.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); Chadwick v. Green, 740 F.2d 897, 900 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cCircumstances which would warrant a presumption of prejudice ... are those where \u2018the adversary process itself is [rendered] presumptively unreliable [by the circumstances].\u2019\u201d) (alterations in original) (footnote omitted); United States v. Russell, 205 F.3d 768, 771 (5th Cir.2000). The trial record in this case makes it abundantly clear that the adversary process leading to Roy\u2019s convictions on each of the five counts against him was not unreliable, much less presumptively so. Roy suffered no prejudice on any count because of his attorney\u2019s seven-minute absence from the 1,884-min-ute trial, and the majority\u2019s conjecture that the testimony presented during counsel\u2019s brief absence \u201ccontributed to [Roy\u2019s] conviction,\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1286, ignores the evidence in the record.\nThe majority\u2019s refusal to take a hard look at whether there was a real possibility of actual prejudice also runs counter to the nature of a critical stage. As the Seventh Circuit has explained, whether part of a criminal prosecution is a critical stage \u201cdepends itself to some degree on a prejudice analysis.\u201d United States v. Morrison, 946 F.2d 484, 503 n. 5 (7th Cir.1991) (\u201cWe note that despite Cronic\u2019s insistence on a presumption of prejudice in certain cases, the definition of a prosecution[ ]\u2019s critical stage \u2014 and hence the determination of whether a prejudice presumption applies\u2014 depends itself to some degree on a prejudice analysis. Even when engaging in a Cronic inquiry, then, we are never completely loosed from the factual moorings of the case before us. The notion that Cronic and its progeny completely obviate the need for any inquiry into the potential for prejudice is thus not entirely accurate.\u201d). To borrow the Seventh Circuit\u2019s apt words, the analysis in the majority opinion is \u201ccompletely loosed from the factual moorings of the case before us.\u201d\nAlS I have pointed out, all of the evidence of Roy\u2019s guilt on Count 1, the attempted child enticement charge, was presented while defense counsel was present. He did not miss any of it. The brief testimony that did occur while counsel was momentarily out of the courtroom went only to Counts 2-5; those four counts involved conduct that was not even discovered by the police until after Roy was arrested on the attempted child enticement charge and his house was searched. The charges in Counts 2-5 were separate from and independent of the Count 1 charge. See supra Part I.\nRoy\u2019s defense theory on Count 1 was that the police had entrapped him in the reverse sting operation. He asserted in closing argument that it had been the police who were \u201cdoing the enticing.\u201d The majority believes that the six images of L.B. that were partially discussed while defense counsel was absent were relevant to Roy\u2019s entrapment defense to Count 1 because the government argued in closing argument that all of the images, including the ones discussed during counsel\u2019s absence, showed Roy\u2019s proclivity for having sex with underage girls. See Maj. Opn. at 1296-97. There are two reasons why that prejudice theory is unconvincing. One reason is that those same six images were discussed in much greater detail and length after counsel returned to the courtroom and, in fact, the six images were *1310admitted into evidence (without objection) only after counsel returned. Anything that the initial testimony about those six images showed about Roy\u2019s proclivity was also shown through the testimony taken and the images that were admitted into evidence while counsel was there.\nThe other reason this possibility of prejudice through proclivity theory is unconvincing is that those six images of L.B. were only a small fraction of the total number of hardcore photographic and video images of her that were discussed and admitted into evidence. The vast majority of the testimony about those six images of L.B. and all of the testimony about the numerous other pornographic images of L.B. took place after counsel returned to the courtroom. Counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, and he did cross-examine him for 45 pages of the trial transcript.\nNot only that, but there were also numerous pornographic images of other minor females found on Roy\u2019s electronic devices. Every bit of the testimony about all of that non-L.B. child pornography came in while defense counsel was present. And every one of the images of child pornography \u2014 of L.B. and of other minors \u2014 was admitted into evidence without objection while defense counsel was present. Roy\u2019s proclivity was overwhelmingly proven by testimony given and evidence admitted in the presence of his counsel.\nWhen the government argued against Roy\u2019s entrapment defense at closing, it did not tell the jury to consider only the six images that Deputy Longson had mentioned while defense counsel was absent. Instead it asked the jury to consider all of the images and videos, stating: \u201cHe was predisposed. You know that from all of these videos and pictures he likes to watch.\u201d There is no doubt, and no reason to doubt, that the adversarial process leading to Roy\u2019s conviction on the Count 1 charge was reliable, and he was not prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s seven-minute absence during which that charge did not even come up.1\nThere is also no question that the adversarial process leading to Roy\u2019s convictions on Counts 2-5 was reliable. Again, those counts were organized by different devices \u2014 a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a USB thumb drive, and three CDs \u2014 that were found in Roy\u2019s home and all of which contained child pornography. To convict him on Counts 2-5, the jury had to find only that he possessed the named device and that he knew it contained at least one image of child pornography. Roy has never denied possessing each of those devices, nor has he ever denied that there was child pornography on them.\nRoy\u2019s defense theory was that all of the L.B. images were taken after her eighteenth birthday. The evidence overwhelmingly disproved that theory, but even if the jury had somehow accepted it, even if we totally disregard not just the six images of L.B. that were discussed in counsel\u2019s absence but all of the L.B. images, the other child pornography on Roy\u2019s various electronic devices establishes his guilt of the charges contained in Counts 2-*13115. And none of that other child pornography was discussed, mentioned, or even alluded to during the seven minutes while defense counsel was outside the courtroom. All of the evidence about that other child pornography came in without objection during the 1,877 minutes, or more than 31 hours, that counsel was present and fully participating in the trial. Because of that evidence, Roy would have been just as guilty of the Count 2-5 charges if the pornographic images and videos of L.B. had never been mentioned, never been discovered, never existed.\nThe majority seeks to render irrelevant the fact that Roy could not possibly have suffered prejudice on any count of conviction by simply labeling counsel\u2019s absence a \u201cstructural error\u201d that precludes any examination of how the evidence related to each count.2 Maj. Opn. at 1296-97. Its circular reasoning is that defense counsel\u2019s temporary absence was a Cronic error and all Cronic errors are structural errors, therefore the temporary absence was structural error. Maj. Opn. at 1293-94. I do not dispute that Cronic errors are structural errors, or at least akin to them, because they require automatic reversal without any inquiry into the existence of actual prejudice. See United States v. Arbolaez, 450 F.3d 1283, 1295 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that the \u201cconstructive denial of counsel is legally presumed to result in prejudice and thus to constitute a structural error\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). But calling Cronic errors structural errors does not add anything to the majority\u2019s analysis. Instead, it simply assumes the conclusion that the temporary absence was Cronic error.\nIf defense counsel\u2019s temporary absence were a Cronic error, it would necessarily follow that it was a structural error, which is a type of error that, by definition, \u201caffect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds\u201d and prevents the trial from \u201creliably serving] its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (emphasis added). As the facts of this case and the previous discussion show, defense counsel\u2019s brief absence did not prevent him from vigorously defending Roy, did not affect the entire framework of Roy\u2019s trial, and did not undermine the reliability of the trial as a mechanism for determining Roy\u2019s guilt or innocence. The seven-minute absence during a trial that lasted more than 31 hours was not a structural error.\nThe majority attempts to bolster its \u201cstructural error\u201d conclusion by asserting that structural errors are ones in which a reviewing court can only speculate as to their effect. Maj. Opn. at 1296. That view won\u2019t work because, as the Supreme Court has pointed out, any and every inquiry into prejudice is necessarily speculative. See Sears, 130 S.Ct. at 3266 (observing that Strickland\u2019s prejudice inquiry \u201cwill necessarily require a court to speculate\u201d). An error is not transformed into structural error simply because in determining whether it had prejudicial effect a reviewing court must engage in speculation. If it were, every error would be structural error mandating reversal; there would be no harmless error review.\n*1312Yet the harmless error doctrine is alive and well. And as the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, the majority of constitutional errors that occur at a criminal trial may be examined for prejudicial effect and do not require reversal if they are harmless. In Fulminante, the Court listed a dozen and a half of its decisions establishing this point, which refutes the majority\u2019s position:\nSince this Court\u2019s landmark decision in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), in which we adopted the general rule that a constitutional error does not automatically require reversal of a conviction, the Court has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless. See, e.g., Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738, 752-754, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 1450-1451, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990) (unconstitutionally overbroad jury instructions at the sentencing stage of a capital case); Satterwhite v.

By insisting that a structural error exists *1313whenever a reviewing court cannot know for certain what effect, if any, the error had, the majority expands the category of structural errors to include most or all errors despite the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reminder that only a \u201cvery limited class of errors\u201d qualifies as structural error. United States v. Davila, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 2149, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013).\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Fulmi-nante illustrates why defense counsel\u2019s brief absence in this case was not a structural error. In that case the Supreme Court held that the improper admission of a coerced confession was subject to harmless error review even though \u201cconfessions have [a] profound impact on the jury, so much so that we may justifiably doubt its ability to put them out of mind even if told to do so.\u201d Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 296, 111 S.Ct. at 1257 (quotation marks omitted). If the erroneous admission of a confession, which may have had a \u201cprofound impact on the jury\u201d is not structural error, then neither is the erroneous admission of inculpatory evidence presented during counsel\u2019s brief absence. That is particularly true where that inculpatory evidence is repeated in counsel\u2019s presence along with other overwhelming evidence of guilt.\nD. The Majority\u2019s Decision Is an Outlier and the Reasons It Gives for Presuming Prejudice Are Not Persuasive\nIn its effort to persuade us that the complete absence of prejudice should not matter, the majority puts forward some decisions from our sister circuits. It also gives several reasons why it believes that Cronic\u2019s presumption of prejudice should apply when defense counsel misses the presentation of any inculpatory evidence, even a single question and answer. That effort to persuade fails.\n1. The Decisions of Other Circuits\nToday\u2019s decision makes us the only court of appeals to hold that any attorney absence during the presentation of any directly inculpatory evidence, even a single question and answer, is \u201cso likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating [its] effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046. This decision is an outlier that puts us way out there.\nThe majority asserts that \u201cno Circuit has applied harmless error review upon a finding that a defendant was deprived of his lawyer during the presentation of incul-patory testimony to the jury.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1294, at *8. That is somewhat misleading because it implies that all circuits have treated attorney absences as Cronic errors, which they have not.3 In United States v. Raid, for example, the Second Circuit was asked to apply Cronic\u2019s presumption to a factual scenario remarkably similar to the one in this case, and it refused to do so. 502 F.3d 43 (2d Cir.2007). In Raid several codefendants were *1314convicted of conspiring to commit money laundering and trafficking in contraband cigarettes. Id. at 45. Defense counsel for one of those codefendants, Azzeaz Saleh, missed 20 minutes of his client\u2019s trial because he misunderstood when the judge planned to continue the trial after a lunch break. Id. at 44-45. During defense counsel\u2019s absence, the government presented evidence that was highly inculpato-ry of Saleh. The government showed video footage of Saleh and other codefendants purchasing the contraband cigarettes that were in issue at the trial, and it called a witness to the stand who testified \u201cat nine separate points that the video showed Sa-leh.\u201d Id. at 45. On appeal Saleh argued that he was entitled to a presumption of prejudice because his attorney had been absent during a critical stage of the trial, id. at 46, but the Second Circuit unequivocally rejected that argument and applied Strickland to Saleh\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Id. at 46-47. The Raid court affirmed Saleh\u2019s convictions after concluding that he had not suffered prejudice from his counsel\u2019s 20-minute absence because (1) counsel had been able to challenge the admissibility of the identification testimony the day before he was absent from the courtroom, and (2) after he returned to the courtroom counsel had been able to cross-examine the witness who had repeatedly identified Saleh in the video. Id. at 47. The circumstances in our case are even stronger for affirmance than those in Raid, because there is no indication in the Raid opinion that the evidence counsel missed was repeated after he returned to the courtroom; here, we know it was. The Raid decision is correct, and it is important.\nThe majority attempts to distinguish Raid, by arguing that the Second Circuit\u2019s decision \u201chas nothing to do with Cronic\u201d because the defendant in Raid raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the court analyzed the claim in that ease under Strickland. See Maj. Opn. at 1294-95, at *8. The majority\u2019s argument ignores the fact that Cronic concerned ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and that its sole function is to serve as a rare exception to the requirement that a defendant show prejudice from an error relating to counsel. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666, 104 S.Ct. at 2051 (concluding that \u201c[t]his case is not one in which the surrounding circumstances make it unlikely that the defendant could have received the effective assistance of counsel \u201d) (emphasis added). Indeed, the very issue presented to the Second Circuit by the argument of the petitioner in that case was whether Cronic\u2019s presumption of per se prejudice applied, or instead the petitioner had to show prejudice. See Raid, 502 F.3d at 46 (\u201cSaleh argues, however, that the above mentioned Strickland requirements, particularly the prejudice prong, are not necessary because his counsel\u2019s absence constituted per se ineffective assistance.\u201d). The petitioner in Raid argued that Cronic meant he did not have to show prejudice. See Brief for Defendant-Appellant Azzeaz Saleh at 9, Kaid, 502 F.3d 43 (No. 05-4470-cr), 2006 WL 5309723 (citing Cronic in support of Saleh\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a presumption of prejudice). The Second Circuit rejected Saleh\u2019s Cronic contention and held that he had to show that his attorney\u2019s absence from trial prejudiced him. And it held that he failed to do so, even though his counsel missed the presentation of twenty minutes of in-culpatory testimony (as compared to seven minutes in this case). The majority concedes that \u201cthe Second Circuit worked under Strickland\u2019s framework, not Cronic\u2019s,\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1294-95, at *8, but it fails to recognize what that means, which is that the Second Circuit rejected the argument that Cronic should apply to a brief ab*1315sence of counsel from trial during the presentation of inculpatory testimony.\nAlthough the majority cites various decisions from other circuit courts of appeals in support of its claim that Cronic applies when counsel is absent during the presentation of any inculpatory evidence, all of those decisions are distinguishable from the present case. The circuits that have applied Cronic\u2019s presumption to attorney trial absences have done so only when those absences were substantial. In Russell, for example, the Fifth Circuit applied Cronic when counsel missed two entire days of trial. 205 F.3d at 669-71. That case did not involve an absence of only seven minutes of a six-day trial, and it did not involve a situation where all of the questions and answers that counsel missed were repeated after he returned to the courtroom. The Fifth Circuit also applied Cronic to a constructive attorney absence when defense counsel was \u201crepeatedly unconscious through not insubstantial portions of the defendant\u2019s capital murder trial,\u201d having \u201crepeatedly dozed and/or actually slept during substantial portions of [the] capital murder trial.\u201d Burdine, 262 F.3d at 340-41. Seven minutes is not a substantial portion of a six-day trial. And, in any event, there is no indication in the Burdine opinion that the testimony defense counsel missed while unconscious was repeated in full after he returned to a state of consciousness.\nThe Sixth Circuit applied the Cronic presumption in a case where defense counsel missed at least 100 minutes of trial.4 See Green v. Arn, 809 F.2d 1257, 1260-61 (6th Cir.1987), vacated on other grounds, 484 U.S. 806, 108 S.Ct. 52, 98 L.Ed.2d 17 *1316(1987), reinstated, 839 F.2d 300 (1988). But a hundred minutes is not seven minutes, and the Green court acknowledged that \u201csome absences by a criminal defendant\u2019s attorney might be so de minimis that there would be no constitutional significance.\u201d Id. at 1261. The counsel in that case missed cross-examining an important prosecution witness because he had left the trial to attend to other business. Id. at 1259-60. That did not happen in the present case where counsel cross-examined the witness and did so for 45 pages of the trial transcript. Instead of being \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to this case, as the majority believes, the facts in Green are clearly distinguishable. In another case the Sixth Circuit again applied a presumption of prejudice where defense counsel \u201cwas absent on numerous occasions during trial,\u201d including for the entire testimony of two witnesses against him and the presentation of incriminating wiretap evidence. Olden v. United States, 224 F.3d 561, 568-69 (6th Cir.2000). That did not happen here.\nIn United States v. Patterson, 215 F.3d 776, 783, 785-86 (7th Cir.2000), vacated in part on other grounds, 531 U.S. 1033, 121 S.Ct. 621, 148 L.Ed.2d 531 (2000), the Seventh Circuit held that an inquiry into prejudice was unnecessary when defense counsel missed a lot of the trial. And I mean a lot. He \u201cmissed seven days of [a police officer\u2019s] testimony, four of five sessions of the jury instruction conference, most of the other defendants\u2019 closing arguments, and proceedings to address notes from the jury during deliberations.\u201d Id. at 783. Seven days is not seven minutes.\nThe attorney absences in all of the decisions from other circuits that the majority relies on were lengthy \u2014 far longer than in this case. In addition, the trial court was aware of defense counsel\u2019s absence in almost every one of those cases.5 And in none of those cases was the testimony that counsel had missed repeated after he returned to the courtroom, as it was here. While it may be said that the absences of counsel in the cases cited by the majority were, so substantial and \u201cso likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect [was] unjustified,\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046, the same cannot be said of the brief absence in this case. The closest case to the facts of this one is Raid, where the Second Circuit refused to presume prejudice and affirmed the convictions. Today\u2019s decision stands alone as the most extreme application of Cronic. It has no peers.\n2. Temporary Attorney Absences Are Not Always Prejudicial and Courts Can Determine Whether Prejudice Occurred\nIn support of its position, the majority engages in a lengthy discussion to establish that Cronic error and structural error are not subject to harmless error review. See Maj. Opn. at 1293-95, *7-8. Everyone knows that. That is not the issue. The issue is whether a brief attorney absence during the presentation of any inculpatory evidence at all is always Cronic error no matter what. If it is a Cronic error, then it is a structural error and not subject to review for harmlessness. If it is not a Cronic error, then we review for harmlessness if the error was properly preserved at trial or only for plain error if it was not.\nThe majority asserts that whenever an attorney is not present during any part of *1317the presentation of inculpatory evidence, no matter how small the part he missed, we should find Cronic error and presume prejudice because determining whether there actually was prejudice would be \u201can exacting and problematic undertaking\u201d and a court can never \u201caccurately determine whether and to what extent counsel\u2019s absence prejudiced\u201d a defendant. Maj. Opn. at 1294, at *8. The majority relies on a law review article for its belief about that instead of on relevant decisions that provide sounder guidance. See, e.g., United States v. Osterbrock, 891 F.2d 1216, 1218 (6th Cir.1989) (applying harmless error review to attorney\u2019s trial absence when jury verdict was returned); Siverson v. O\u2019Leary, 764 F.2d 1208, 1218-19 (7th Cir.1985) (applying harmless error review to attorney\u2019s absence during jury deliberations and return of verdict); United States v. Calabro, 467 F.2d 973, 988-89 (2d Cir.1972) (same).\nMany state appellate courts have concluded that courts are capable of determining whether the temporary absence of an attorney prejudiced a defendant. See Jackson v. State, 983 So.2d 562, 574-77 (Fla.2008) (applying harmless error analysis to trial court\u2019s decision to hear testimony from the victim for purposes of sentencing the defendant while defense counsel was absent); Wilson v. State, 764 So.2d 813, 816-19 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000) (applying harmless error analysis to defense counsel\u2019s absence during jury deliberations and proceedings involving a question from the jury); State v. Scherzer, 301 N.J.Super. 363, 694 A.2d 196, 237-40 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1997) (applying harmless error analysis where defense counsel was absent \u201cfrom many pretrial proceedings; a portion of jury voir dire; several days of testimony during trial, including the entire testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness ...; parts of [the] codefendants\u2019 and the prosecutor\u2019s summations; a portion of the charge conference; some of the jury\u2019s questions during deliberations; and also the reading of the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d); Hodges v. State, 116 S.W.3d 289, 292-94 (Tex.App.2003) (applying harmless error analysis to defense counsel\u2019s absence during presentation of adverse testimony from a detective during the penalty phase of a case). In the Hodges decision, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stated that it agreed with our decision in Vines that a temporary absence of counsel during part of the trial does not necessarily infect the entire trial and preclude application of the harmless error doctrine. Hodges, 116 S.W.3d at 294 n. 7.\nIn our decision in Vines, we specifically held that:\n[T]he temporary absence of a defendant\u2019s trial counsel during a portion of the actual trial does not necessarily affect the conduct of the entire trial. While trial counsel may exercise poor judgment in absenting himself or herself from a portion of a trial, such flawed judgment does not necessarily infect the entire trial.\n28 F.3d at 1129 (emphasis omitted). We determined in Vines that harmless error analysis was appropriate after concluding that the attorney absence in that case was neither Cronic error nor structural error, but instead a \u201ctrial error.\u201d Id. at 1128-29. Like the attorney\u2019s absence in Vines, the attorney\u2019s brief absence in this case does not qualify as Cronic error or structural error because, as explained in Part II.C above, it did not render Roy\u2019s entire trial unreliable. See id. at 1129 (explaining that structural defects, such as \u201cthe total deprivation of counsel,\u201d \u201cnecessarily affect the conduct of the entire trial\u201d and involve errors so egregious that \u201cin their absence no criminal trial can be deemed reliable\u201d).\nAlthough our conclusion in Vines that the Cronic presumption of prejudice did *1318not apply came after we had found that the evidence introduced during counsel\u2019s absence was not directly inculpatory, see Vines, 28 F.3d at 1128, we did not hold that the Cronic presumption applies whenever any inculpatory evidence is presented during counsel\u2019s absence. We could not have held that in Vines because those were not the facts before us in that case. See Watts v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 316 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[J]udicial decisions cannot make law beyond the facts of the cases in which those decisions are announced.\u201d); see also Anders v. Hometown Mortg. Servs., Inc., 346 F.3d 1024, 1031 (11th Cir.2003). We have never held that prejudice is conclusively presumed if any inculpatory evidence at all is taken in counsel\u2019s absence, and we should not be holding that today.\nAny error involving the seven-minute absence of Roy\u2019s counsel during the testimony of one of thirteen government witnesses during a six-day trial, where the same evidence also came in during testimony the witness gave after counsel returned, is at most a \u201ctrial error.\u201d As we explained in Vines:\nA trial error is an error which occurs during the presentation of a case to a jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed ... in order to determine whether [it] was harmless.\n28 F.3d at 1129 (quotation marks and brackets omitted). Again, the record in this case is such that we can assess the testimony that occurred in the seven-minute absence of Roy\u2019s counsel to determine whether that absence was harmless. See supra Part II.C.\nDespite these controlling principles, the majority insists that prejudice must be presumed because the absence of counsel during the presentation of inculpatory evidence \u201celiminates the opportunity to decide whether to lodge an objection and how to frame the objection.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1291, at *5. That assertion, as well as the majority\u2019s claim that Roy\u2019s attorney \u201ccould not have known\u201d what evidence he missed, Maj. Opn. at 1295-96, at *9, is simply not correct. A defense attorney who misses any moment of the direct examination of a government witness could, upon returning to the courtroom, ask that the transcript be read back outside the presence of the jury and request that any objectionable testimony be stricken from the record. And once that testimony has been read back to defense counsel, he would have full knowledge of the witness\u2019 statements, which he could then challenge on cross-examination.\nIn this case, as far as we know, Roy\u2019s attorney did not ask for an opportunity to review the portion of Deputy Longson\u2019s testimony that he had missed. But we do know that there was no lost-objection prejudice from his seven-minute absence because no exhibits were admitted during that time, and when the same testimony was presented immediately after counsel returned, he did not object to any of it. There is no valid objection that he could have made had he been there the seven minutes he was absent (Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has not suggested one), and counsel was able to vigorously cross-examine Longson about his testimony after he returned to the courtroom.\nThe defect in the majority\u2019s reasoning is also apparent from the fact that courts regularly analyze whether an attorney\u2019s failure to object resulted in prejudice. See, e.g., Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 366, 113 S.Ct. 838, 841, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993) (determining whether petitioner was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to make an objection in a state criminal sentencing proceeding\u201d in a capital ease); Gordon v. United States, 518 F.3d 1291, 1299-1301 (11th Cir.2008) (determining whether trial \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to object to *1319an absence of inquiry about the right to allocute\u201d prejudiced the habeas petitioner); Purvis v. Crosby, 451 F.Bd 784, 738 (11th Cir.2006) (determining whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the closure of the courtroom during a young victim\u2019s testimony in a child molestation trial prejudiced the habeas petitioner); Sims v. Singletary, 155 F.3d 1297, 1309 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that \u201cassuming arguendo that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted ineffective assistance, [the petitioner] has shown no prejudice as a result of this inaction\u201d). Although the majority contends that the prejudice inquiry is an \u201cexacting and problematic undertaking,\u201d there is nothing unusual or unusually difficult about determining whether a failure to object was prejudicial. Courts do it all the time. The majority\u2019s position that we cannot or should not determine whether a failure to object was prejudicial is contrary to binding precedent and our regular practice.\nThe majority also asserts that counsel\u2019s absence during the presentation of any inculpatory testimony \u201celiminates ... the ability to conduct cross-examination.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1291, at *5. Not necessarily, and not in this case. As I mentioned earlier, once counsel returns to the courtroom he can ask to have the transcript read back to him outside the presence of the jury. That would provide him with full knowledge of the witness\u2019 statements, which he could then challenge on cross-examination. And as this case illustrates, that approach may not even be necessary where the witness repeats all of his testimony after defense counsel returns to the courtroom. It is obvious in this case that defense counsel\u2019s absence for seven minutes of Longson\u2019s testimony did not eliminate his ability to cross-examine that witness. The record shows that the testimony Deputy Longson gave during counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence was repeated immediately after he returned, and counsel vigorously cross-examined Longson about it.\nAnd even if defense counsel\u2019s ability to cross-examine Longson had been impeded, the majority\u2019s reasoning is flawed because it assumes that any gap or shortcoming in cross-examination cannot be examined for its prejudicial effect. Although the majority may believe that it is \u201can exacting and problematic\u201d task to do so, courts regularly inquire into whether an attorney\u2019s failure to cross-examine a witness in a particular way or to use a particular strategy or tactic in cross-examination prejudiced the defendant. See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 289-95, 296, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1952-55, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (determining whether petitioner had shown prejudice from being deprived of any opportunity to use certain withheld documents to impeach a key prosecution witness, and finding that he had); Fugate v. Head, 261 F.3d 1206, 1220 (11th Cir.2001) (determining whether petitioner had shown prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination to impeach the sole eyewitness to the murder with his prior inconsistent statement to the police, and finding that he had not); id. at 1220-21 (determining whether petitioner had shown prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination of the medical examiner to impeach him with inconsistencies between his autopsy report and his testimony, and finding that he had not); Nixon v. Newsome, 888 F.2d 112, 116 (11th Cir.1989) (determining whether petitioner had shown prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination to impeach the key prosecution witness with her prior inconsistent testimony, and finding that he had); Smith v. Wainwright, 799 F.2d 1442, 1444 (11th Cir.1986) (determining whether petitioner had shown prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination to impeach the two prosecution witnesses *1320with their prior inconsistent statements, and finding that he had not). All of those decisions and others show that courts can, and regularly do, determine whether a failure to cross-examine a witness about a particular fact or in a particular way was prejudicial. There is nothing unusual or especially difficult about doing that. If there were, we would not do it routinely. Yet we do. We could and should do it in this case.\nThe majority also theorizes that prejudice must be presumed from defense counsel\u2019s brief absence because \u201ca defendant may irretrievably lose available defenses and rights during direct testimony of a prosecution witness.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1291, at *5. The first problem with that theory is that it confuses presentation of the government\u2019s case at trial with arraignment. The only authorities that the majority cites for its proposition are two decisions that involved a defense attorney\u2019s absence from arraignment. See Hamilton, 368 U.S. at 54, 82 S.Ct. at 159; White, 373 U.S. at 60, 83 S.Ct. at 1051. There is a difference between arraignment, where certain defenses must be asserted or lost, and the direct examination of a prosecution witness during the middle of a trial, where the defendant is not required to assert defenses.\nThe second problem with the majority\u2019s lost-defenses theory is that, even if a defense is somehow lost by defense counsel missing a few minutes of a direct examination, courts regularly inquire into whether a defense attorney\u2019s failure to raise a defense at trial prejudiced the defendant. See Roberts v. Comm\u2019r, Ala. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 677 F.3d 1086, 1090-93 (11th Cir.2012) (insanity defense); Pietri v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 641 F.3d 1276, 1280-84 (11th Cir.2011) (voluntary intoxication defense); West v. United States, 631 F.Sd 563, 567-68 (1st Cir.2011) (entrapment defense); Currier v. United States, 320 F.3d 52, 56-57 (1st Cir.2003) (necessity defense). We did just that, just last year, when we held that an attorney\u2019s failure to assert a voluntary intoxication defense on behalf of a capital defendant was not prejudicial. See Reaves v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 717 F.3d 886, 900-05 (11th Cir.2013). The majority, presumably, would have decided the \u201clost defenses\u201d cases differently than this Court did in Roberts, Pietri, and Reaves because it believes that looking into prejudice is an \u201cexacting and problematic\u201d endeavor. But binding precedent is binding precedent, and the majority\u2019s position that a prejudice inquiry is impossible, or at least should not be permitted, on a lost-defense claim is contrary to all of that binding precedent. In any event, neither the majority nor Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has been able to point to any conceivable defenses that were lost by defense counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence in this case.\nAlthough the majority does not argue this, a defense counsel\u2019s temporary absence might also be prejudicial if it results in the failure to present evidence countering the testimony of an adverse witness. But that possibility does not require a presumption of prejudice because courts regularly determine whether an attorney\u2019s failure to present evidence prejudiced the defendant. See, e.g., Hinton v. Alabama, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1081, 1089-90, 188 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014) (vacating and remanding to allow the district court to determine whether petitioner was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to request additional funding in order to hire an adequate expert); Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 791-92, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (determining whether petitioner was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to present expert testimony on serology, pathology, and blood spatter patterns); Jackson v. Herring, 42 F.3d 1350, 1362, 1368-69 (11th Cir.1995) (determining whether petitioner *1321was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence at sentencing). This kind of prejudice inquiry is old hat for courts. We do it often, without any suggestion that it is impossible or too much trouble. It is part of our judicial duties.\nDespite all of this long-standing precedent, the majority insists that we must presume prejudice because \u201c[i]t would be difficult, if not impossible, for us as a reviewing court to discern, on a cold record, the reaction of the jury to the evidence presented and, therefore, to what extent counsel may have been able to react in a manner that would improve his client\u2019s likelihood of acquittal.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1295, at *20. Really? Does this mean that in order to be effective an attorney must constantly monitor the jurors\u2019 faces for reactions to the testimony? Does it mean that if defense counsel focuses on the witness or is reading his notes during the testimony, prejudice must be presumed from his failure to watch \u201cthe reaction of the jury to the evidence\u201d? In any event, the majority\u2019s assertion, which is supported only by citation to a Nebraska Law Review article, goes against all of the binding precedent cited in this section, in addition to all of our case law dealing with claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, which illustrates that courts regularly rely on a \u201ccold record\u201d to determine whether prejudice actually occurred.\nIII. The Majority\u2019s Holding Will Have Far Reaching Adverse Effects\nUnder the majority\u2019s holding and reasoning, if defense counsel misses even a single inculpatory question and answer, courts in this circuit must conclusively presume prejudice and set aside any conviction no matter how clearly and irrefutably the record establishes that there was no prejudice. Even when a court is firmly convinced there is no prejudice. No exceptions. It does not matter what the facts are, it does not matter how overwhelming the other evidence of guilt is, it does not matter if no reasonable person could believe that counsel\u2019s momentary absence made any difference at all. Prejudice is not required because it is conclusively presumed, which in this instance means that we must pretend that something exists even if we know that it does not. Nothing else will ever matter but the majority\u2019s ironclad rule that nothing else matters. And the majority\u2019s rule has a wide kill zone. Not only must the conviction on the count that the missed testimony concerns be extinguished, but every conviction on every count in the indictment must be as well. No exceptions.\nThe majority makes a futile attempt to persuade us that maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 its all-encompassing rule might not encompass all inculpatory testimony after all. It points out that counsel\u2019s absence came during not just the testimony of any old witness for the prosecution but during the testimony of the deputy sheriff who was the government\u2019s specialist expert witness. See Maj. Opn. at 1297-98, at *11. But so what? For purposes of the pretend-prejudice rule what principled basis is there for distinguishing one category or type of prosecution witness from another? Suppose the deputy sheriff had not been testifying as an expert witness in the field of computer forensics but for some other reason. Would that have mattered; if so, why? Or suppose the government\u2019s computer expert witness had not been a deputy but instead had been an outside expert hired on a contract basis. Would that have mattered; if so, why? Or suppose the witness testifying while counsel was out had been a non-law enforcement, non-expert witness who nonetheless gave incriminating testimony against Roy. Would that have mattered; if so, why? The point *1322is that all, or virtually all, government witnesses give inculpatory testimony against the defendant, which is why they are government witnesses. There is no principled basis for distinguishing one from another. The majority\u2019s absolute, all-encompassing pretend-prejudice rule either encompasses all witnesses who give any inculpatory testimony or it encompasses none. It ought to be none.\nThe majority opinion and its ironclad, pretend-prejudice rule will as a practical matter require district judges to closely monitor their courtrooms to ensure that each attorney arrives on time in the morning, returns promptly after every break, is at the bench during each discussion there, and doesn\u2019t step out of the courtroom for even a moment while testimony is being taken. Judges, like kindergarten teachers, will be forced to keep an eye on their lawyer-children at all times to prevent one from toddling away without being noticed. How this is to be done, given everything else that is going on in a trial and competing for the judge\u2019s attention, the majority does not say. Maybe the requirement of perfect attendance during every minute of the trial can be achieved by forcing each lawyer to wear an ankle bracelet rigged to set off an alarm when he strays out of range from counsel table. That might do the trick. Given all of the important duties a judge has during a trial, the majority creates a misguided rule that now requires a judge to keep an eye on all of the attorneys at all times throughout a trial, under pain of automatic reversal if one attorney momentarily steps away unnoticed.\nThere also is no reason why this \u201cRoy rule\u201d won\u2019t apply to situations where defense counsel\u2019s constructive or actual absence is likely to go unnoticed by the prosecution and the judge, such as where defense counsel dozes during trial or in a large multi-defendant trial where counsel is actually absent. There is no principled basis not to apply the rule of today\u2019s decision to those two situations as well. Why would the risk of prejudice, or the justification for pretending that there was prejudice, be any less if Roy\u2019s counsel had dozed off during those seven minutes and, instead of being physically away from the courtroom, was away in dreamland? Either way the attorney would not be conscious of what was being said. All an attorney now has to do to get his client an automatic reversal of any conviction is file an affidavit stating that he had inadvertently dozed off during two or three minutes while a government witness was testifying against his client and for that reason missed some of the testimony. Remember that under the majority\u2019s rule once an attorney\u2019s absence, in this hypothetical a mental absence, is shown, prejudice must be conclusively presumed and all of the defendant\u2019s convictions overturned. No questions may be asked of counsel. So trial judges will have the duty not only to ensure that every defendant\u2019s attorney is physically present during every minute of the trial but also that every attorney is wide awake and alert at all times. The prudent judge may want to have each counsel table stocked with caffeine tablets and energy drinks.6\n*1323Whatever measures a judge takes in response to today\u2019s ruling, it will be practically impossible to prevent presumptive prejudice error in a large, multidefendant, long-running trial. See Green, 809 F.2d at 1265 (Boggs, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf a reversal is mandated whenever counsel (even retained) is absent from the courtroom for any significant period, we make such an escape a sure ticket to a new trial. In multi-defendant cases, judges will be required to keep a continual head count ... lest cagey counsel be able to invoke this new rule.\u201d). After the judge, jury, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and others have spent months in a complex trial and verdicts of conviction have been returned, none of it will mean anything for any defendant whose attorney can show that he was absent or dozed off during any of the testimony from any of the many witnesses against his client. That will be true even if the attorney missed only a few of the thousands of questions and answers that directly or indirectly inculpated his client during the long trial. It will not matter, as the majority insists it does not matter in this case, whether the inculpato-ry testimony that the attorney missed was repeated in his (conscious) presence. And it will not matter in the least why the attorney was absent or whether the judge noticed the absence. That is the rule the majority adopts.\nThe majority suggests that its no-exceptions, pretend-prejudice rule is particularly warranted in this case because there was only a single defendant and a single defense attorney for the court to monitor. See Maj. Opn. at 1286-87, 1298, at *1, *12. But the rationale for the Cronie rule, and the majority\u2019s reason for applying it and presuming prejudice in this case, has nothing to do with the number of defendants or defense attorneys in a particular case. The Cronie opinion does not talk about the ease of preventing an error but instead about the great likelihood of prejudice from certain errors, such as the total deprivation of counsel from an entire stage of the trial. See 466 U.S. at 658-60, 104 S.Ct. at 2046-47. Why would the risk of prejudice, or the justification for presuming it, be any less if Roy had been tried with eight or ten codefendants and the same inculpatory evidence had been presented while his attorney was absent? There is no logical reason why the likelihood that an attorney absence is overlooked, or the difficulty in guarding against an absence and ensuring perfect attendance and perfect attention, would change the prejudicial effect of an absence. If the prejudicial effect of a seven-minute absence must be conclusively presumed in this case involving a six-day trial with one defendant, it must also be conclusively presumed when there is a seven-minute absence during a six-month trial with a dozen defendants. The presumption of prejudice that the majority has written into our circuit law logically must apply in all trials or in none. It should be none.\nThe majority\u2019s rule permits no inquiry into the reason or motivation behind the absence, as its refusal to permit a remand for an evidentiary inquiry in this case demonstrates. Even if a defense attorney deliberately steps out of the courtroom for a minute or two for the purpose of putting in his pocket a get-out-of-jail-free card for his client, he still gets to play that card. His absence trumps his client\u2019s conviction, which must be set aside, and no further questions may be asked because nothing else matters. We must always pretend that prejudice exists. Absence, whatever the reason or motive, equals reversal.\nThe majority tells us not to worry about an attorney deliberately missing a few minutes of testimony to guarantee that any conviction of his client will be set aside. See Maj. Opn. at 1297-98, at *11. *1324It could not possibly be a problem, we are told, because lawyers are \u201cofficers of the Court bound by rules of professional responsibility.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1297, at *11. The majority believes that the threat of disciplinary proceedings will prevent defense attorneys from taking advantage of today\u2019s holding. That is not true, but \u201c[i]sn\u2019t it pretty to think so?\u201d7 If lawyers were angels, the majority\u2019s belief that all lawyers are always ethical would make sense, but if they were angels we would not need ethical rules and disciplinary bodies. Lawyers are people and like all people they have flaws and failings and sometimes behave improperly and unethically. The majority\u2019s contrary theory does not fit the world in which we live.\nAnd the facts belie the majority\u2019s theory. Lawyers practicing in our circuit are regularly disciplined and even prosecuted for violating their ethical duties and the law. The Florida Supreme Court enters hundreds of orders each year disciplining attorneys for unethical conduct.8 The Georgia Supreme Court enters more than a hundred each year,9 and the Alabama Supreme Court is not far behind.10 In all, there were more than 600 disciplinary orders entered against lawyers in the three states of our circuit during 2011, the last published reporting year.11 And those are counting only the cases where lawyers were caught and formally disciplined.\nThe temptation to game the system and take advantage of the guaranteed reversal that the Roy rule creates will be especially great in capital cases. Many attorneys who represent capital defendants sincerely believe that the death penalty is not only bad policy but is also immoral. They can literally save their client\u2019s life, or at least delay his death, by strategically slipping out of the courtroom for a few minutes, or returning to it a little late, while the prosecution\u2019s case against him is being presented. And what about counsel representing a defendant who is a member of a violent gang? His client may insist that counsel game the system with a brief absence so that any conviction can be overturned under \u201cthe Roy rule.\u201d The client\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d may be one that counsel finds difficult to refuse.\nThe majority is confident that lawyers won\u2019t place their licenses in jeopardy by strategically taking advantage of today\u2019s holding. That confidence is especially unwarranted because there is so little chance that an attorney who does take advantage of the \u201cRoy rule\u201d would ever suffer any consequences. If a trial judge notices defense counsel leaving the courtroom in the middle of trial, the penalty for that act is relatively small. See United States v. Fakhoury, 819 F.2d 1415, 1424 (7th Cir.1987) (\u201c[Tjrial counsel was reprimanded by the district judge for leaving the court*1325room when the government was presenting its ease.... \u201d). If the trial judge does not notice defense counsel\u2019s brief absence and the issue is raised for the first time on appeal, counsel can avoid ever having to account for his absence by having a new attorney represent the defendant on appeal. Recall that in this case trial counsel has never been held to account for his absence or even asked about it. The majority sees no reason for inquiring into the absence because all that matters to the majority is the fact that it occurred, not the reason it occurred. And even if there were an inquiry, how would one ever prove that the reason an attorney was out of the courtroom was his subjective intent to ensure a reversal of any conviction?\nAnd what about a \u201cconstructive\u201d absence? If a defense attorney decides on the 15th day of a trial that the proceeding is not going well for his client, what is to stop him from closing his eyes for a minute or two during the examination of a government witness, approaching the judge to claim that he was \u201csleeping\u201d when his eyes were closed, and then asserting that his client is entitled to a mistrial because he was constructively absent during the presentation of inculpatory evidence? How could the court know whether the attorney had in fact been asleep?\nFor all of these reasons, the majority\u2019s reasoning is unpersuasive and the \u201cvery narrow\u201d presumed prejudice rule of Cronic should not be applied in this case. See Stano, 921 F.2d at 1153 (quotation marks omitted).\nIV. How We Should Decide This Case\nBecause any error involved in counsel\u2019s momentary absence from the courtroom was not Cronic error, it was at most trial error and trial errors are subject to the normal rules of review. See Vines, 28 F.3d at 1128-29.\nA. The Contemporaneous Objection Rule Furthers Important Interests of Our Criminal Justice System and Should Apply to Brief Attorney Absences from the Courtroom\nThe contemporaneous objection rule requires an objection in the trial court before a defendant is entitled to plenary review on appeal. The rule \u201cfosters finality of judgment and deters sandbagging\u201d by preventing a party from \u201csaving an issue for appeal in hopes of having another shot at trial if the first one misses.\u201d United States v. Rodriguez, 627 F.3d 1372, 1379 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). It also promotes \u201cthe salutary interest of making the trial the main event\u201d because \u201c[f]ailure to enforce it tends to detract from the perception of the trial of a criminal case ... as a decisive and portentous event.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted and ellipsis in original). By requiring timely objections, we \u201callow[ ] trial courts to develop a full record on [an] issue, consider the matter, and correct any error before substantial judicial resources are wasted on appeal and then in an unnecessary retrial.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). Finally, the rule provides substantial assistance for appellate review because \u201c[a] full record and a prior decision in the district court are essential ingredients to our substantive review of issues.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). An objection allows for the \u201cthe record to be made with respect to a constitutional claim when the recollections of witnesses are freshest\u201d and \u201cenables the judge who observed the demean- or of those witnesses to make the factual determinations necessary for properly deciding the federal constitutional question.\u201d Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 88, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2507, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of the contemporaneous objec*1326tion rule and the values it supports. As the Court wrote in Sykes:\n[When a] defendant has been accused of a serious crime, [the trial] is the time and place set for him to be tried by a jury of his peers and found either guilty or not guilty by that jury. To the greatest extent possible all issues which bear on this charge should be determined in this proceeding: the accused is in the court-room, the jury is in the box, the judge is on the bench, and the witnesses, having been subpoenaed and duly sworn, await their turn to testify. Society\u2019s resources have been concentrated at that time and place in order to decide, within the limits of human fallibility, the question of guilt or innocence of one of its citizens. Any procedural rule which encourages the result that those proceedings be as free of error as possible is thoroughly desirable, and the contemporaneous-objection rule surely falls within this classification.\nId. at 90, 97 S.Ct. at 2508.\nBy not objecting when he returned to the courtroom to testimony having been taken during his brief absence, Roy\u2019s trial counsel deprived the district court of an opportunity to address the problem on the spot, just after it occurred, and while everyone\u2019s recollection of the events were as fresh as they could be. If counsel had objected, the attorneys and the judge could have decided what, if any, action was appropriate to remedy the problem. One possibility is that the court could have had the court reporter, outside the presence of the jury, read to counsel the questions and answers he had missed, and then let counsel decide whether he wanted some or all of them stricken and the jury instructed to disregard them. That way, when those questions were asked again in his presence, counsel could object to any of them for which there was any arguable basis for objection.\nBy requiring a timely objection, the contemporaneous objection rule encourages remedies. Instead of fostering that laudatory policy, the majority\u2019s decision rewards counsel\u2019s silence with an automatic reversal. It \u201ceneourage[s] \u2018sandbagging\u2019 on the part of defense lawyers.\u201d See id. at 89, 97 S.Ct. at 2508. As we have asked before, \u201c[W]hat lawyer will not be \u2018understandably reluctant\u2019 to object if no objection is required? By not objecting the lawyer can avoid any risk that ... an actual error [will be] corrected on the spot....\u201d Rodriguez, 627 F.3d at 1380. By remaining silent, instead of objecting, under today\u2019s holding defense attorneys can get \u201canother shot at trial if the first one misses.\u201d Id. at 1379 (quotation marks omitted).\nB. Roy Has Failed to Show, or Even Assert, That His Counsel Was Unaware That Testimony Had Been Taken During His Brief Absence\nIf Roy\u2019s attorney was unaware that testimony had been taken while he was absent, his failure to object probably should be overlooked. But counsel must have known, and Roy has never even suggested that counsel did not know.\nCounsel knew that the judge had informed everyone before the lunch recess that the trial would resume at 1:30 p.m., and he knew that he was walking in late. When counsel walked into the courtroom, the jury was sitting in the box, Deputy Longson was on the witness stand, and the prosecutor was asking the court for a moment to approach defense counsel following Longson\u2019s response to one of her questions. Id. at 108. The prosecutor then approached and conferred with defense counsel, and although the record does not tell us what they discussed, it seems likely that they talked about the fact that defense counsel had missed some testimony. *1327See id. Under all of the circumstances, it is extremely doubtful that Roy\u2019s attorney did not know that the trial had recommenced without him.12 Indeed, Roy has not even suggested that his attorney was unaware that he had missed some of Long-son\u2019s direct examination.\nBecause Roy\u2019s counsel failed to object to the error, our review should be for plain error only. See United States v. Williams, 527 F.3d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.2008). The majority\u2019s claim that we should not review the error that occurred at Roy\u2019s trial under the plain error standard is wrong because it relies on the faulty premise that a Cronic error occurred in this case. See Maj. Opn. at 1295-96, at *9. None of the opinions that the majority relies on supports its position. First, the majority relies on Justice Souter\u2019s dissent in Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 204, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1261, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002) (Souter, J., dissenting), which was just that, a dissenting opinion, not an opinion of the Court. The dissenting opinion asserted that a court\u2019s error should not be excused simply because an attorney failed to object, but that extreme position would apply to all judicial errors, thereby abolishing the contemporaneous objection rule. Such a proposal is untenable and goes against the settled law that defendants must object even to judicially created errors in order to properly preserve them for full review on appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Davila, 749 F.3d 982, 993-94, 998-99 (11th Cir.2014) (applying plain error review where defendant failed to object to magistrate judge\u2019s \u201cemphatic and highly improper\u201d remarks \u201cregarding the desirability of a guilty plea\u201d). The majority also relies on Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 265 n. 5, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 1100 n. 5, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981), but in that case the Supreme Court did not directly address an issue that had not been properly preserved in the trial court. Instead, it remanded the case for consideration of a possible due process violation that was apparent from the facts of the case but had not been raised on appeal or in the defendant\u2019s petition for certiorari. Id. at 264-65, 101 S.Ct. at 1100. The Supreme Court chose that approach only for prudential reasons because it wanted to avoid deciding a novel constitutional question that had been raised on appeal. Id. at 265, 101 S.Ct. at 1100. Finally, the majority relies on our decision in Harding v. Davis, 878 F.2d 1341 (11th Cir.1989), but unlike this case, Harding involved actual Cronic error. In that case, as a result of a disagreement with his client, defense counsel \u201cremained silent through virtually the entire trial, except for various remarks indicating that [the defendant] did not desire his assistance.\u201d Id. at 1343. As a result, it was as though Harding had no counsel at all because his attorney completely failed to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to any meaningful adversarial testing at all, an obvious Cronic violation. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047. None of those opinions supports the majority\u2019s assertion that plain error review is inappropriate in this case.\nC. Roy Cannot Prevail on Plain Error Review\nUnder plain error review, Roy has the burden of establishing that \u201c(1) an error *1328occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d Rodriguez, 627 F.3d at 1380 (quotation marks omitted). We need not look beyond the third requirement to decide that Roy has not established plain error. To show that an error affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights for plain error purposes, a defendant has the burden of proving \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result\u201d but for the error. Id. at 1382 (quotation marks omitted). If we cannot tell whether an unobjected to error prejudiced a defendant, the defendant loses. United States v. Rodriguez, 398 F.3d 1291, 1299-1300 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that where it is uncertain whether prejudice exists, the defendant loses).\nRoy has not come close to establishing a reasonable probability of a different result but for his counsel\u2019s absence during seven minutes of testimony, less than one-half of one percent of the trial. In fact, the record overwhelmingly establishes that the brief absence could not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict on Count 1. See supra pp. 56-58. Nor could it have affected the jury verdict on Counts 2-5. See supra pp. 59-60. There is no reasonable probability of a different result but for the error, which the majority implicitly recognizes by insisting that we apply Cronic and pretend that there was prejudice.\nD. Roy Could Not Prevail Even Under Plenary Review\nEven if we ignore the failure to object, Roy\u2019s convictions should still be affirmed under plenary review because of the harmless error rule.\nContrary to the majority\u2019s argument, Maj. Opn. at 1293-96, at *7-10, harmless error analysis is not inappropriate, much less impossible, to apply to brief absences of counsel from trial. (And the standard is not whether the error was de minimis, see Maj. Opn. at 1297, but whether it was harmless. It is the harmless error rule, not the de minimis error rule.)\nAs the Supreme Court has held, application of the harmless error doctrine \u201cpromotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial.\u201d Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1838, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (quotation marks omitted). When a constitutional violation occurs in a criminal trial, harmless error analysis is the norm, not the exception. See, e.g., Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 306, 111 S.Ct. at 1263 (\u201cSince this Court\u2019s landmark decision in Chapman v. California, in which we adopted the general rule that a constitutional error does not automatically require reversal of a conviction, the Court has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u201d) (citation omitted) (emphasis added); Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 579, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 3106, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986) (\u201c[I]f the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless-error analysis. The thrust of the many constitutional rules governing the conduct of criminal trials is to ensure that those trials lead to fair and correct judgments. Where a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the interest in fairness has been satisfied and the judgment should be affirmed.\u201d). The majority\u2019s contrary position flies in the face of the Supreme Court\u2019s teaching in Fulminante, Chapman, Rose, and a host of other decisions. See also Vines, 28 F.3d at 1128 (applying harmless error review after concluding \u201cthat the temporary absence of a defendant\u2019s trial counsel during *1329a portion of the actual trial does not necessarily affect the conduct of the entire trial\u201d).\nThe rule the majority adopts today, and its reversal of Roy\u2019s well-deserved convictions without regard to whether the error affected the outcome of the trial, smacks of a \u201csporting theory of justice.\u201d See United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 108, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (quotation marks omitted). It will undermine fairness in the administration of justice by inviting reversals that have nothing to do with the merits of a case. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, \u201cReversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u201d Rose, 478 U.S. at 579, 106 S.Ct. at 3106 (quotation marks omitted); accord Neder, 527 U.S. at 18, 119 S.Ct. at 1838; Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1550, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); see also Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 681, 106 S.Ct. at 1436 (\u201cAs we have stressed on more than one occasion, the Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 122, 54 S.Ct. 330, 338, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934) (\u201c[J]us-tice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser also. The concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to a filament. We are to keep the balance true.\u201d).\nThe public loses confidence in the judicial process when reliable convictions are reversed on technical errors that did not affect the result. See United States v. Keys, 95 F.3d 874, 883 (9th Cir.1996) (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhat really hurts the reputation of judicial proceedings is vacating a criminal conviction because of what laymen properly call a technicality, that is, a technical defect which made no practical difference in the particular case.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted), vacated, 520 U.S. 1226, 117 S.Ct. 1816, 137 L.Ed.2d 1025 (1997). Any rule that requires us as judges to decide a case by pretending that something exists, when we as men and women know that it does not, risks undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the administration of justice. That is another reason the majority\u2019s \u201cRoy rule\u201d is wrong.\n\n. The majority claims that I contend that Roy\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count 1 should stand \"even if counsel's absence taints the conviction as to Counts 2-5\u201d because \"we can separate out the evidence as to each count.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1296. Just to be clear, my position is that counsel\u2019s absence did not taint any of Roy\u2019s convictions, including the convictions on Counts 2-5. Period. And the very fact that we can easily separate out the evidence as to each count in this case is a persuasive indication that the error in Roy\u2019s trial was not Cronic error. Because there was no Cronic error, there is no presumption of prejudice.\n\n\n. The majority asserts that looking into whether there was prejudice as to each count \u201cmakes little sense because we would have to speculate about what evidence the jury may have applied in its deliberations as to each individual count.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1297, at *10. The majority appears to disregard the fact that every inquiry into prejudice is inherently speculative, yet courts do it all the time. Cf. Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, 130 S.Ct. 3259, 3266, 177 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2010) (observing that Strickland\u2019s prejudice inquiry \"will necessarily require a court to speculate\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n. Actually, that is not the only part of that sentence from the majority opinion that is wrong. The first clause of the sentence says: \"Despite other Circuits\u2019 willingness to apply harmless error review to Cronic error generally. ...\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1294, at *8. No circuit has been willing to apply harmless error review to a Cronic error, nor should one. As I have explained, if there is Cronic error, no prejudice need be shown. The majority cites Siverson v. O\u2019Leary, 764 F.2d 1208, 1217-19 (7th Cir.1985), as an example of a decision applying the harmless error rule to Cronic error, but the Seventh Circuit did not find Cronic error in that case. Instead, it found that the absence of counsel during jury deliberations, including when the judge questioned the jury about whether it had reached a verdict, and counsel's absence during the return of the verdict was not Cronic error and was harmless. Id. at 1217-21.\n\n\n. Although the majority points out that there may be some ambiguity in the Green opinion concerning the length of defense counsel\u2019s absence, see Majority Opn. at *6 n. 2, portions of the transcript quoted in the Green decision indicate that the absence was not brief. See Green, 809 F.2d at 1260-61 (noting that defense counsel for Green\u2019s codefendants had begun cross-examining a witness at 2 pm and by 3:40 pm the defendant\u2019s trial counsel still had not returned to the courtroom). The majority also fails to acknowledge that Green alleged that her attorney had been absent during other portions of the criminal proceedings against her, including an entire hearing on a suppression motion, the government's closing arguments at trial, and when the jury asked the court questions during its deliberations. Id. at 1259 n. 1. Nothing like that happened in this case.\nEven though defense counsel in Green missed far more of the trial than Roy\u2019s counsel missed in this case, the decision to presume prejudice was ardently attacked by a dissenting judge in that case. Judge Boggs recognized that the majority\u2019s decision in Green went well beyond Cronic, created perverse incentives for defense attorneys, and unduly burdened trial judges. He noted that Cronic applied where there was a \"complete denial of counsel\u201d at a critical stage, and that a presumption of prejudice was warranted only when there was a denial of counsel that was \"complete in terms of the process of truth-seeking.\u201d Id. at 1264 (Boggs, J., dissenting) (quotation marks omitted). He argued that there was no complete denial of counsel in Green because of \"the episodic nature of the absence.\u201d Id. at 1265.\nThe majority argues that \"Judge Boggs, the dissenter in Green, would seem to join the majority in this case.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1297, at *11. That is a mistaken view of his position, as this excerpt from his dissenting opinion in that case makes clear:\nHere, there is no hint or even speculation that what went into the record or into the ears of the jury would have differed if the error had not occurred. Nor is this an instance where counsel\u2019s presence to object or take a strategic decision could have been crucial, nor where an opportunity was irrevocably waived. It elevates form over substance to equate what occurred here to the true denials of counsel cited in Cronic.\nGreen, 809 F.2d at 1265 (Boggs, J. dissenting). Exactly the same is true in this case where the majority has elevated form over substance to reverse convictions based on a false analogy to the denial of counsel during an entire stage of a criminal prosecution, the situation to which Cronic applies.\n\n\n. The only clear exception is that the trial court in Burdine was unaware that defense counsel was sleeping. Burdine, 262 F.3d at 389 (Barksdale, J., dissenting). The Patterson decision does not indicate whether the trial court was aware of the defense attorney\u2019s absence in that case.\n\n\n. Judges might also consider converting their bailiffs into something akin to Puritan Tith-ingmen. Those \"ancient watchm[e]n of the congregation\u201d had among their duties \"disturb[ing] the slumbers of age\u201d and seeing to it \"that all persons were attentive\u201d throughout seemingly interminable sermons. They carried a wooden rod tipped at one end with a squirrel's tail used to awaken female congregants who dozed off. At the other end was a brass tip, or in some cases a deer's hoof, \"which carried sharp conviction to men and boys\u201d who dared doze. Herbert B. Adams, Saxon Tithingmen in America 1 &amp; n. 1 (1883).\n\n\n. Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises 247 (Macmillan Publ\u2019g Co.1987) (1926).\n\n\n. Florida attorneys were publically disciplined in 380 instances in 2011, 380 instances in 2012, and 233 instances in 2013. See Standing Comm, on Prof'l Discipline, ABA Ctr. for Prof'l Responsibility, 2011 Survey on Lawyer Discipline Systems (S.O.L.D.) (2013). The ABA has not yet published its S.O.L.D. reports for 2012 and 2013, and the figures for those years come from preliminary data submitted to the ABA by Florida\u2019s disciplinary agency.\n\n\n. Georgia lawyers were disciplined in 177 instances in 2011, 149 instances in 2012, and 120 instances in 2013. See ABA, supra. Like the 2012 and 2013 statistics for Florida, Georgia\u2019s figures for those two years come from preliminary data collected by the ABA.\n\n\n. Alabama lawyers were sanctioned in 82 instances in 2011. See ABA, supra. Alabama\u2019s figures for 2012 and 2013 have not yet been reported to the ABA.\n\n\n. See supra nn. 1289-90.\n\n\n. Even if the scene confronting defense counsel when he returned to the courtroom had not signaled to him that the trial had continued in his absence, testimony from Deputy Longson soon after counsel\u2019s return would have alerted him to that fact. With counsel back in the courtroom, Longson specifically testified that one of the photos was one he had \"described earlier\" showing \"a white female who is bound to a table by her feet with a red and white ski rope.\u201d The record shows that the only time that photo had been described earlier was during the part of Longson's testimony that occurred while counsel was out of the courtroom.\n\n",

Cronic, 466 U.S.\n\n648, 659, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 2047 (1984), which creates a presumption of prejudice\n\nand requires a new trial when counsel is absent during a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the trial.\n\nBecause (1) Roy was a sole defendant during his criminal trial, (2) the afternoon\n\nsession of Roy\u2019s trial commenced while his counsel was actually and physically\n\nabsent, and (3) during that absence, evidence directly inculpating Roy in a crime\n\nfor which he was eventually convicted was presented to the jury, we conclude that\n\nRoy was denied counsel at a critical stage, and based on Cronic, we are required to\n\nreverse Roy\u2019s conviction as to all counts of the indictment and remand the case to\n\nthe district court for a new trial.\n\n                                           I.\n\n       Pursuant to a \u201creverse sting\u201d operation conducted in conjunction with the\n\nOsceola County Sherriff\u2019s Office (OCSO), Detective Athena Ross of the Sumter\n\nCounty Sherriff\u2019s Office (SCSO) placed an advertisement on Craigslist purportedly\n\nsoliciting sex for two women. Roy responded to the advertisement, after which\n\nRoss, acting undercover, told Roy that the advertisement was for herself, a thirty-\n\nyear-old woman named Denise, and her daughter, a thirteen-year-old girl named\n\nTorie. Roy, \u201cDenise,\u201d and \u201cTorie\u201d (played by a second undercover SCSO\n\n                                            2\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 3 of 101\n\n\ndetective) discussed various potential sexual activities by email, telephone, and\n\ntext message. Eventually, they arranged a meeting at a Waffle House restaurant in\n\nKissimmee, Florida. Roy drove to the restaurant and entered the parking lot, but\n\nhe drove away without ever parking his vehicle. OCSO deputies pulled him over\n\nand arrested him, finding condoms and lubricant in his pockets.\n\n      OCSO conducted two searches of Roy\u2019s home, leading to the seizure of a\n\ndesktop computer, a laptop, a thumb drive, and three compact discs, all of which\n\ncontained photographs and videos containing child pornography. Detectives also\n\nfound the text of online conversations Roy had with L.B., a minor with whom Roy\n\nhad carried on a romantic relationship. L.B. was depicted in some of the\n\npornography found on his computer, which Roy himself created. Much of the\n\nchild pornography depicted other underage girls.\n\n      Roy was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida\n\non one count of enticing or attempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual\n\nactivity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) (Count 1) and four counts of\n\npossession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and\n\n(b)(2) (Counts 2\u20135). A motion to suppress the evidence seized during the\n\nexecution of the warrants was denied.\n\n      During a portion of Roy\u2019s jury trial, defense counsel was absent from the\n\ncourtroom immediately following a lunchtime recess. There was no explanation\n\n                                          3\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 4 of 101\n\n\nfor the absence in the record. Prior to the recess, the court had stated that the trial\n\nwould recommence at 1:30 p.m. Instead, it started at 1:29 p.m. without defense\n\ncounsel present; counsel did not arrive until 1:36 p.m. The record does not reflect\n\nany reaction by the court or the government either to counsel\u2019s absence or to his\n\nlate arrival, though the court reporter did note both in the transcript. During\n\ncounsel\u2019s absence, the government offered the following testimony from its\n\ncomputer forensics expert witness, Detective Charlie Longson of OCSO:\n\n      Q.   Now, did you have occasion to find during your forensic\n      examination a folder on the desktop computer named \u201cMy Pictures,\u201d\n      which would fall within the \u201cMy Documents\u201d file that was on that\n      computer?\n\n      A.     Yes, I did.\n\n      Q.    And within the \u201cMy Pictures\u201d folder, were there other\n      subfolders?\n\n      A.     Yes.\n\n      Q.   And how were they categorized within that general folder of\n      \u201cMy Pictures\u201d?\n\n      A.    Those folders were categorized by date, the year first, month\n      second, and the date third.\n\n      Q.    And were you able to determine any folders that had\u2014or\n      contained notable images within them?\n\n      A.     Yes. I did find folders with notable images.\n\n      Q.    And what were\u2014what was the first folder of concern that you\n      found?\n\n                                           4\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 5 of 101\n\n\n      A.     The first one I found was named \u201c2006-03-11.\u201d\n\n      Q.   And would that folder have been created by a user of that\n      computer?\n\n      A.     Yes, it was.\n\n      Q.     And did you find any images within that folder?\n\n      A.     Yes, I did. I found six images.\n\n      Q.    And would you please describe the images to the ladies and\n      gentlemen of the jury within that March 11, 2006, folder that you\n      found?\n\n      A.    These images are a nude white female who was bound to a table\n      by her feet with rope. The subject was laid across the table and had\n      her head covered with an orange cloth which was secured around her\n      neck with silver duct tape.\n\n      Q.    Were you able to determine forensically how those pictures had\n      been taken?\n\n      A.     Yes. They were taken with a Kodak v530 zoom digital camera.\n\n      Q.     And were you able to determine forensically a date and time\n      those images were taken?\n\n      A.   Yes, I was. These were taken on March the 10th, 2005, at 6:49\n      p.m.\n\nCounsel returned soon after this exchange and, upon his return, did not raise any\n\nobjections. Direct examination of Detective Longson continued uninterrupted.\n\nDetective Longson later testified as to the identity of the individual portrayed in the\n\nphotographs, L.B., as well as her date of birth: May 9, 1989. The jury found Roy\n\nguilty on all counts, and the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n                                          5\n\f              Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 6 of 101\n\n\n      Roy raises four claims on appeal. Of these, we address only the Sixth\n\nAmendment denial of counsel claim. Specifically, Roy contends that his counsel\u2019s\n\nabsence occurred during a critical stage of trial when inculpatory evidence was\n\nadmitted against him and that, therefore, he is entitled to a new trial pursuant to\n\nCronic, 466 U.S. at 658\u201359, 104 S. Ct. at 2046\u201347.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      \u201cThe claim that the temporary absence of trial counsel during the taking of\n\nevidence constitutes a Sixth Amendment violation presents a mixed question of\n\nlaw and fact and, as such, is subject to plenary review.\u201d Vines v. United States, 28\n\nF.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir. 1994).\n\n      A criminal defendant is entitled to the \u201cAssistance of Counsel for his\n\ndefence.\u201d U.S. Const. amend VI. In Cronic, the Supreme Court \u201cconclude[d] that\n\na trial is unfair if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.\u201d 466\n\nU.S. at 659, 104 S. Ct. at 2047; see also Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 695\u201396, 122\n\nS. Ct. 1843, 1851 (2002) (listing the three bases for the Cronic presumption: (1)\n\n\u201ccomplete denial of counsel,\u201d including at a critical stage; (2) failure by counsel\n\n\u201cto subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing;\u201d and (3)\n\n\u201cwhere counsel is called upon to render assistance under circumstances where\n\ncompetent counsel very likely could not\u201d).\n\n                                            A.\n\n                                            6\n\f               Case: 12-15093       Date Filed: 08/05/2014      Page: 7 of 101\n\n\n       Roy contends that he was denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial when\n\nthe government recommenced direct examination of Detective Longson during his\n\ncounsel\u2019s absence from the courtroom. We must first decide, then, whether the\n\nportion of trial conducted in the absence of defense counsel was in fact a critical\n\nstage. Although there is no strict test or definition for a critical stage of trial, the\n\nSupreme Court, other United States Courts of Appeals, and our own precedent\n\nprovide us with guideposts to help answer that question.\n\n       In Vines, we did not apply a Cronic presumption of prejudice when Vines\u2019s\n\nlawyer was absent during the presentation of testimony to the jury. 28 F.3d at\n\n1128. Vines was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and\n\nconspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. Id. at 1125. The district\n\ncourt excused Vines\u2019s counsel on the first day of trial at 4:15 pm. 1 Id. at 1125\u201326.\n\nDuring his absence, two witnesses testified. Id. at 1126. One witness testified\n\nabout the arrest of Vines\u2019s co-defendant. Id. The second witness, who was part\n\nowner and operator of the warehouse where the shipment containing the cocaine\n\nwas received, \u201csimply testified about leasing the space.\u201d Id. Vines was convicted\n\nof the possession charge but was acquitted of conspiracy. Id. On appeal from the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201cwe decline[d] to give birth\n\n\n       1\n          We did not decide whether Vines waived his right to counsel because, after determining\nthat his counsel\u2019s absence was a trial error rather than a structural defect, we decided any\nconstitutional deprivation was harmless. Vines, 28 F.3d at 1129\u201331.\n                                               7\n\f              Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 8 of 101\n\n\nto a rule that the taking of evidence is necessarily a critical stage of trial [and\n\nfound] that no evidence directly inculpating Vines was presented during his\n\ncounsel\u2019s absence.\u201d Id. at 1128. Because \u201cno evidence directly inculpating [Vines\n\nwas] presented while [his] counsel [was] absent, we decline[d] to hold that counsel\n\nwas absent during a critical stage of trial within the meaning of Cronic.\u201d Id.\n\n      Vines, however, does not control our analysis because counsel here was\n\nabsent during the presentation of testimony directly inculpating Roy. Before\n\ncounsel returned, the following evidence was admitted through the testimony of\n\nDetective Longson, a witness for the prosecution:\n\n      Q.   And how were they categorized within that general folder of\n      \u201cMy Pictures\u201d?\n\n      A.    Those folders were categorized by date, the year first, month\n      second, and the date third.\n\n      Q.    And were you able to determine any folders that had\u2014or\n      contained notable images within them?\n\n      A.     Yes. I did find folders with notable images.\n\n      Q.    And what were\u2014what was the first folder of concern that you\n      found?\n\n      A.     The first one I found was named \u201c2006-03-11.\u201d\n\n      Q.   And would that folder have been created by a user of that\n      computer?\n\n      A.     Yes, it was.\n\n      Q.     And did you find any images within that folder?\n                                            8\n\f             Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 9 of 101\n\n\n      A.     Yes, I did. I found six images.\n\n      Q.    And would you please describe the images to the ladies and\n      gentlemen of the jury within that March 11, 2006, folder that you\n      found?\n\n      A.    These images are a nude white female who was bound to a table\n      by her feet with rope. The subject was laid across the table and had\n      her head covered with an orange cloth which was secured around her\n      neck with silver duct tape.\n\n      Q.    Were you able to determine forensically how those pictures had\n      been taken?\n\n      A.     Yes. They were taken with a Kodak v530 zoom digital camera.\n\n      Q.     And were you able to determine forensically a date and time\n      those images were taken?\n\n      A.   Yes, I was. These were taken on March the 10th, 2005, at 6:49\n      p.m.\n\nThat testimony, given during counsel\u2019s absence, established the date on which\n\nsome images at issue were created, that the folders in which they were contained\n\nwould \u201chave been created by a user of that computer,\u201d and the content of those\n\nimages. The district court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the possession counts\n\nincluded the following:\n\n      The Defendant can be found guilty of [possession of child\n      pornography] only if all the following facts are proved beyond a\n      reasonable doubt: [(1)] [t]he Defendant knowingly possessed a visual\n      depiction; [(2)] [t]hat the depiction was shipped or transported in\n      interstate or foreign commerce by any means including a computer or\n      that was produced using material that had been mailed, shipped, or\n      transported in interstate or foreign commerce; [(3)] [t]hat producing\n      the visual depiction involved the use of a minor engaged in sexually\n                                          9\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 10 of 101\n\n\n      explicit conduct; [(4)] [t]hat the depiction is of a minor engaged in\n      sexually explicit conduct; and [(5)] [t]hat the Defendant knew that at\n      least one performer was a minor and knew that the depiction showed\n      the minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\n\nThe evidence presented to the jury during counsel\u2019s absence, therefore, provided a\n\nbasis for conviction on those jury instructions. The testimony that \u201ca user of that\n\ncomputer\u201d would have created the folders containing the pornographic images\n\nsupports the conclusion that Roy \u201cknowingly possessed a visual depiction.\u201d The\n\nidentification of the date on which the images were created, when combined with\n\nDetective Longson\u2019s later identification of the subject\u2019s date of birth, and the\n\ndescription of the content of the images supported the third, fourth, and fifth\n\nelements\u2014that the images \u201cinvolved the use of a minor engaged in sexually\n\nexplicit conduct;\u201d that they were \u201cof a minor engaged in sexually explicit\n\nconduct;\u201d and that Roy \u201cknew that [they] showed the minor engaged in sexually\n\nexplicit conduct.\u201d\n\n      Thus, this case is markedly different from our prior decision in Vines. Here,\n\nthe government presented the jury with directly inculpatory evidence on a count\n\nfor which Roy was ultimately convicted while his attorney was absent from the\n\ncourtroom. In Vines, the government did not present evidence of Vines\u2019s own\n\nwrongdoing, and he was acquitted on the conspiracy charge, severing any potential\n\nimputation of his co-defendants\u2019 wrongdoing to him. 28 F.3d at 1126, 1128\n\n(\u201cUpon review of the record, we find that no evidence directly inculpating Vines\n                                          10\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 11 of 101\n\n\nwas presented during his counsel\u2019s absence. Where, as in this case, no evidence\n\ndirectly inculpating a defendant is presented while that defendant\u2019s counsel is\n\nabsent, we decline to hold that counsel was absent during a critical stage of trial\n\nwithin the meaning of Cronic.\u201d); cf. United States v. Russell, 205 F.3d 768, 772\n\n(5th Cir. 2000) (distinguishing the case presented, in which evidence directly\n\ninculpating only Russell\u2019s co-conspirators was presented during counsel\u2019s absence,\n\nfrom Vines because Russell was convicted of conspiracy, while Vines was\n\nacquitted of the conspiracy charge). Hence, we must decide whether the\n\npresentation of directly inculpatory testimony materially distinguishes this case\n\nfrom Vines and constitutes a critical stage of a criminal trial.\n\n      Whether a portion of trial is critical is a categorical question; it is not the\n\nunique facts of a particular trial that decide the issue but the nature of the stage.\n\nSee Van v. Jones, 475 F.3d 292, 301\u201302 (6th Cir. 2007) (emphasizing the\n\n\u201caccentuat[ion of] the categorical nature of [the critical stage] inquiry\u201d); Burdine v.\n\nJohnson, 262 F.3d 336, 347 (5th Cir. 2001) (\u201cTo justify a particular stage as\n\ncritical, the Court has not required the defendant to explain how having counsel\n\nwould have altered the outcome of his specific case. Rather, the Court has looked\n\nto whether the substantial rights of a defendant may be affected during that type of\n\nproceeding.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Hunter v. Moore, 304 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f              Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 12 of 101\n\n\n1066, 1070 (11th Cir. 2002) (concluding that closing argument is categorically a\n\ncritical stage).\n\n       One working definition of a critical stage for purposes of Cronic is that set\n\nforth by the Sixth Circuit in Van after it considered a quintet of Supreme Court\n\nopinions as well as one of its own: whether \u201ca reasonable likelihood that\n\n[substantial prejudice to the defendant\u2019s rights] will arise from complete absence of\n\ncounsel.\u201d 475 F.3d at 313. The Supreme Court opinions on which Van relied hold\n\nthat a critical stage arises when \u201c[a]vailable defenses may be . . . irretrievably lost,\n\nif not then and there asserted,\u201d Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 54, 82 S. Ct.\n\n157, 159 (1961), \u201cwhere rights are preserved or lost,\u201d White v. Maryland, 373 U.S.\n\n59, 60, 83 S.

See Van, 475 F.3d at 312.\n\n       Consideration of these precedents, as well as the Sixth Circuit\u2019s helpful\n\nstandard, convinces us that Roy\u2019s counsel was absent during a critical stage of his\n\n                                           12\n\f             Case: 12-15093       Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 13 of 101\n\n\ntrial. It is clear that there exists \u201ca reasonable likelihood that [substantial prejudice\n\nto the defendant\u2019s rights] will arise from complete absence of counsel\u201d during the\n\npresentation of directly inculpatory testimony to the jury. Van, 475 F.3d at 313.\n\nThe absence of counsel during the presentation of inculpatory evidence used by the\n\ngovernment to convict the defendant eliminates the opportunity to decide whether\n\nto lodge an objection and how to frame the objection, as well as the ability to\n\nconduct cross-examination. See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct.\n\n1105, 1111 (\u201c[D]eni[al of] the right of effective cross-examination [is]\n\nconstitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of\n\nprejudice would cure it.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, a defendant\n\nmay irretrievably lose available defenses and rights during direct testimony of a\n\nprosecution witness. See Hamilton, 368 U.S. at 54, 82 S. Ct. at 159; White, 373\n\nU.S. at 60, 83 S. Ct. at 1051. The presence of counsel during the examination of\n\nan adverse witness is \u201cnecessary to assure a meaningful \u2018defence.\u2019\u201d See Wade, 388\n\nU.S. at 225, 87 S. Ct. at 1931.\n\n      The present case presents a circumstance substantially similar to the Sixth\n\nCircuit decision in Green v. Arn, 809 F.2d 1257 (6th Cir.), vacated and remanded\n\non other grounds, 484 U.S. 806, 108 S. Ct. 52 (1987), reinstated on remand, 839\n\nF.2d 300 (6th Cir. 1988). In Green, a habeas corpus petitioner had been jointly\n\ntried with two other co-defendants. Id. at 1259. The co-defendants were\n\n                                            13\n\f              Case: 12-15093       Date Filed: 08/05/2014      Page: 14 of 101\n\n\nrepresented by a separate lawyer than that of Ms. Green. Id. Green\u2019s lawyer \u201cwas\n\nabsent during a critical part of the afternoon\u201d of the trial, and although co-counsel\n\nwas present, Green\u2019s lawyer was not. 2 Id. at 1259\u201361. During Green\u2019s lawyer\u2019s\n\nabsence, co-defendants\u2019 counsel conducted cross-examination of a prosecution\n\nwitness. Id. at 1259. Green was convicted of kidnapping and gross sexual\n\nimposition. Id. Affirming the grant of a writ of habeas corpus, the Sixth Circuit\n\ndetermined that \u201c[t]he presumption that counsel\u2019s assistance is essential requires us\n\nto conclude that a trial is unfair if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage\n\nof his trial.\u201d Id. at 1263 (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S. Ct. at 2047). The\n\nSixth Circuit went even further to say that \u201cif counsel entirely fails to subject the\n\nprosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing, then there has been a denial of\n\nSixth Amendment rights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively\n\nunreliable\u201d. Id. (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S. Ct. at 2047). And when\n\nthe Sixth Amendment claim is, as here, \u201cthe denial, rather than the ineffective\n\nassistance, of counsel, the criminal defendant need only show that counsel was\n\nabsent during a critical stage of the proceedings in order to establish the\n\nconstitutional violation. Absence from the proceedings is deficient performance as\n\na matter of law, and prejudice is presumed.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n       2\n         Notably, the absence may have been as short as five minutes, as the government argued;\nGreen asserted that it was nearly two hours long. Green, 809 F.2d at 1265 (Boggs, J.,\ndissenting).\n                                              14\n\f             Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 15 of 101\n\n\n                                      B.\n\n      The Fifth Circuit agrees that Cronic prejudice arises when the defendant is\n\ndeprived of the presence of counsel during the presentation of inculpatory\n\ntestimony to the jury. In Russell, the defendant was charged with and convicted of\n\n(1) conspiracy to possess cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute, and (2)\n\nconspiracy to launder money that was the proceeds of a drug transaction. 205 F.3d\n\nat 769. Russell\u2019s attorney was absent for two days of a joint trial while ill without\n\nRussell\u2019s waiver. Id. at 769\u201370, 771. Counsel for a co-defendant volunteered to\n\nsit in for Russell\u2019s counsel, and \u201c[t]he district court instructed the government not\n\nto call any witness relevant to Russell\u201d while Russell\u2019s counsel was absent. Id.\n\n769\u201370. During counsel\u2019s absence, none of the testimony presented \u201cdirectly\n\nimplicated Russell,\u201d but evidence relating to the conspiracy, which detailed the co-\n\nconspirators\u2019 attempts to launder money and import marijuana, was introduced. Id.\n\nat 770. Prior to the absence of counsel, the government had presented evidence\n\n\u201cabout Russell\u2019s management of the distribution of marijuana operations and\n\ninvolvement in providing [a co-conspirator] with funds.\u201d Id. The evidence\n\npresented during counsel\u2019s absence therefore \u201cflowed directly from Russell\u2019s role\n\nin the money laundering conspiracy to the roles of [his co-conspirators] in the same\n\nmoney laundering conspiracy and the overall conspiracy to import and distribute\n\nmarijuana.\u201d Id. Russell filed a motion to vacate the sentence pursuant to 28\n\n                                           15\n\f               Case: 12-15093        Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 16 of 101\n\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. Id. at 769. Although declining to\n\nadopt a \u201cbright line rule that the taking of any evidence at trial in the absence of\n\ncounsel is prejudicial per se,\u201d 3 id. at 771, the Fifth Circuit determined that counsel\n\nwas denied at a critical stage and that the Cronic presumption applied because\n\n\u201cRussell [was] without counsel as the probability of his guilt increased during the\n\ngovernment\u2019s presentation of evidence against his co-conspirators,\u201d id. at 772.\n\nRussell\u2019s conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Id.\n\nat 773.\n\n       Here, as in Russell, \u201cthe probability of [Roy\u2019s] guilt increased during the\n\ngovernment\u2019s presentation of evidence,\u201d Russell, 205 F.3d at 772, and \u201c[i]t is\n\ndifficult to perceive a more critical stage of a trial than the taking of evidence on\n\nthe defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d Green, 809 F.2d at 1263. At Roy\u2019s trial, evidence admitted\n\nto prove that Roy knowingly possessed photographs of a minor engaged in\n\nsexually explicit conduct was presented to the jury during his lawyer\u2019s absence\n\nfrom the courtroom. The absence constitutes \u201ccircumstances that are so likely to\n\nprejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is\n\nunjustified.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S. Ct. at 2046. We therefore find that\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Compare this with our conclusion in Vines: \u201c[W]e decline to give birth to a rule that the\ntaking of evidence is necessarily a critical stage of trial\u201d where \u201cno evidence directly inculpating\nVines was presented during his counsel\u2019s absence.\u201d 28 F.3d at 1128.\n                                                 16\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 17 of 101\n\n\nRoy was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a critical stage of his\n\ntrial and that Cronic requires a reversal of his convictions.\n\n                                          C.\n\n      Typically, where an appellant demonstrates constitutional error, an appellate\n\ncourt will not disturb a conviction if the government is able to show that the error\n\n\u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18,\n\n24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 828 (1967). Courts applying the Cronic presumption of\n\nprejudice where counsel was denied at a critical stage have reached varying\n\nconclusions regarding the applicability of harmless error review under those\n\ncircumstances. Compare Siverson v. O\u2019Leary, 764 F.2d 1208, 1217\u201319 (7th Cir.\n\n1985) (applying harmless error review to Cronic error), with Green, 809 F.2d at\n\n1263 (failing to apply harmless error review to the facts before it). We, however,\n\nhave previously held that \u201cstructural error exists where counsel is \u2018prevented from\n\nassisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.\u2019\u201d United States v.\n\nArbolaez, 450 F.3d 1283, 1295 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (quoting Cronic, 466\n\nU.S. at 659 n.25, 104 S. Ct. at 2047 n.25). Structural error is not subject to\n\nharmless error review. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 309, 111 S. Ct.\n\n1246, 1265 (1991) (Rehnquist, C.J., maj. op.) (\u201cThese are structural defects in the\n\nconstitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f               Case: 12-15093       Date Filed: 08/05/2014      Page: 18 of 101\n\n\nstandards.\u201d); Vines, 28 F.3d at 1129 (\u201cTrial errors are subject to harmless-error\n\nanalysis; structural defects are not.\u201d).\n\n      As we have stated, Cronic error is structural. \u201c[A]ny deprivation of\n\nassistance of counsel constitutes reversible error and necessitates a new trial. Our\n\nrule does not include a harmless error analysis. Cronic and Strickland4 make\n\nclear that where actual or constructive denial of assistance of counsel occurs a per\n\nse rule of prejudice applies.\u201d Crutchfield v. Wainwright, 803 F.2d 1103, 1108\n\n(11th Cir. 1986) (en banc) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nCronic error necessitates a per se reversal. See Smith v. Wainwright, 777 F.2d 609,\n\n616 (11th Cir. 1985) (\u201cWhere, however, a petitioner demonstrates that\n\ncircumstances surrounding his representation give rise to a presumption of\n\nprejudice, he will prevail.\u201d (citing Cronic, 466 U.S. at 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. at 2046\n\nn.20)); Harding v. Davis, 878 F.2d 1341, 1345\u201346 (11th Cir. 1989) (reversing after\n\nfinding Cronic error without conducting harmless error review); Hunter, 304 F.3d\n\nat 1070 (\u201c[D]enial of counsel at a critical stage . . . warrants reversal without a\n\nspecific showing of prejudice.\u201d); Darden v.

Ct. 2871 (2013) (\u201cWhen [denial of counsel at a\n\ncritical stage or other Cronic error] occurs, the reviewing court presumes the\n\ndefendant was prejudiced and his conviction is in turn vacated.\u201d).\n\n\n      4\n          Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.

Although the\n\ndissent makes a reference to United States v. Kaid, 502 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2007) (per\n\ncuriam), Kaid has nothing to do with Cronic. The Second Circuit confined its\n\nreview to \u201cwhether a defense attorney\u2019s purported twenty-minute absence from the\n\ncourtroom during a testimonial phase of a criminal trial constitutes ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\u201d Id. at 44 (emphasis added). In other words, the Second\n\nCircuit worked under Strickland\u2019s framework, not Cronic\u2019s. Id. at 46\u201347.\n\n      In Green, the Sixth Circuit considered \u201cwhether harmless error analysis is\n\nappropriate where a petitioner demonstrates she was unrepresented by counsel for\n\na critical period of time during the taking of evidence against her at trial.\u201d Green,\n\n809 F.2d at 1258. Green was tried jointly with two other co-defendants who were\n\nrepresented by separate counsel. Id. at 1259. Green was represented by her\n\nretained counsel. Id. Although her lawyer was present during a portion of the\n\nafternoon session of a day of her trial, he was absent during a critical part of the\n\nafternoon. Id. As the Sixth Circuit stated, \u201cthe present case is one where a\n\nharmless error inquiry should be foreclosed. It is difficult to perceive a more\n\ncritical stage of a trial than the taking of evidence on the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Id. at\n\n                                           19\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 20 of 101\n\n\n1263. Further stated: \u201cThe absence of counsel during the taking of evidence on the\n\ndefendant\u2019s guilt is prejudicial per se and justifies an automatic grant of the writ\n\n\u2018without any opportunity for a harmless error inquiry.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Siverson, 764\n\nF.2d at 1217 n.6).\n\n      The Seventh and District of Columbia Circuits have likewise determined\n\nthat harmless error review is inappropriate when counsel is denied at certain\n\ncritical stages. See Siverson, 764 F.2d at 1217 n.6 (\u201cWe recognize that the lack of\n\ncounsel at some critical stages may be considered prejudicial per se, and may result\n\nin automatic reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions without any opportunity for a\n\nharmless error inquiry.\u201d); United States v. Decoster, 624 F.2d 196, 256 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1976) (en banc) (\u201cThus, where the defendant had no counsel at all at a critical\n\nstage of his trial, automatic reversal of his conviction is usually in order.\u201d).\n\n      Harmless error review in a case like this one would be an exacting and\n\nproblematic undertaking. First, as a reviewing court, we could not accurately\n\ndetermine whether and to what extent counsel\u2019s absence prejudiced the defendant.\n\nSee David A. Moran, Don\u2019t Worry, I\u2019ll Be Right Back: Temporary Absences of\n\nCounsel During Criminal Trials and the Rule of Automatic Reversal, 85 Neb. L.\n\nRev. 186, 207\u201309 (2006). It would be difficult, if not impossible, for us as a\n\nreviewing court to discern, on a cold record, the reaction of the jury to the evidence\n\npresented and, therefore, to what extent counsel may have been able to react in a\n\n                                           20\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 21 of 101\n\n\nmanner that would improve his client\u2019s likelihood of acquittal had he been present\n\nin the courtroom. See id. at 207 (\u201cDuring an ongoing trial, real-world trial counsel\n\nmake crucial decisions based on the reaction of the jury to testimony, evidence,\n\nargument, and other courtroom proceedings.\u201d). In other words, harmless error\n\nreview under these circumstances either would give a defendant no meaningful\n\nopportunity to challenge his conviction for denial of counsel during presentation of\n\ninculpatory evidence or would require us to ignore relevant considerations simply\n\nbecause they cannot be discerned from the record. See id. at 209.\n\n       Upon his return to the courtroom, Roy\u2019s counsel failed to lodge an objection\n\nto the admission of the evidence that he missed. Of course, he could not have\n\nknown what evidence he missed, as he was absent. The contemporaneous\n\nobjection rule ordinarily requires a party to object to the introduction of evidence at\n\nthe time it is introduced. Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S. Ct.\n\n1423, 1428\u201329 (2009). Failure to do so subjects that evidentiary ruling to plain\n\nerror review. Fed R. Crim. P. 52(b); Puckett, 556 U.S. at 135, 129 S. Ct. at 1429.\n\nHowever, plain error review is inapplicable in this context. As Cronic notes,\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s presence is assured \u201cnot for its own sake, but because of the\n\neffect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial,\u201d e.g., to ensure that\n\nsomeone is present to prevent the improper introduction of evidence. 466 U.S. at\n\n658, 104 S. Ct. at 2046; cf. Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 204, 122 S. Ct. 1237,\n\n                                            21\n\f               Case: 12-15093        Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 22 of 101\n\n\n1261 (2002) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhy excuse a judge\u2019s breach of judicial duty\n\njust because a lawyer has fallen down in his own ethics or is short on competence?\n\nTransforming the factually sufficient trigger of a formal objection into a legal\n\nnecessity for responding to any breach of judicial duty is irrational. . . . The\n\nobjection requirement works elsewhere because the objecting lawyer believes that\n\nhe sights an error being committed by the judge or opposing counsel. That is\n\nhardly the motive to depend on when the risk of error, if there is one, is being\n\ncreated by the lawyer himself . . . .\u201d (citation omitted)); Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S.\n\n261, 265 n.5, 101 S.

The Fifth Circuit did not\n\napply plain error review in Russell, 205 F.3d at 772\u201373, even though \u201c[t]he district\n\ncourt did not speak to Russell or ask for his consent to the\u201d absence, and counsel\n\n\u201cdid not question anything that took place in his absence,\u201d id. at 770. Further, we\n\nhave refused to subject Cronic error to plain error review even where counsel\n\nremained silent when the judge directed a verdict against the defendant, a blatant\n\nconstitutional error. See Harding, 878 F.2d at 1345\u201346. 5 Therefore, plain error\n\nreview is not applicable under these circumstances.\n\n\n      5\n          Notably, in Harding, though the directed verdict was likely reversible plain error, see\n                                                 22\n\f              Case: 12-15093       Date Filed: 08/05/2014      Page: 23 of 101\n\n\n       Where, as here, structural error has occurred, the entire trial is unfair and the\n\nconvictions as to all counts are tainted. See Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309\u201310, 111\n\nS. Ct. at 1265. The Supreme Court has defined structural errors as those where the\n\nreviewing court \u201ccan only engage in pure speculation\u201d about what the jury might\n\nhave done; their consequences are \u201cnecessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate.\u201d\n\nSullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 281\u201382, 113 S.

Ct. at 1264\u201365 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). There are some errors that courts can accurately\n\nmeasure and hold harmless. This is not one of them.

Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 578, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 3106 (1986), we reversed for Cronic error,\nnot for the directed verdict. See Harding, 878 F.2d at 1345\u201346.\n                                               23\n\f            Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 24 of 101\n\n\ncan separate out the evidence as to each count. Therefore, Count 1, for which Roy\n\nreceived a life sentence, was unaffected by the evidence received during counsel\u2019s\n\nabsence as to Counts 2\u20135.\n\n      But the government asked the jury to do the complete opposite at Roy\u2019s trial.\n\nRoy was charged in Count 1 with enticing or attempting to entice a minor to\n\nengage in sexual activity. Counts 2\u20135 charged him with possession of child\n\npornography on his computer which, according to the government\u2019s evidence, he\n\nviewed a couple of days before traveling to the Waffle House in Kissimmee,\n\nFlorida, where his attempt to entice a minor allegedly occurred. As the\n\ngovernment stated in its closing argument:\n\n      Well, we know where he went, ladies and gentlemen, and I submit to\n      you we know what he was ultimately planning to do, because his\n      interest starts a couple days before.\n\n      You\u2019ll recall the evidence. He\u2019s accessing his girl\u2019s folder on the\n      laptop, he\u2019s accessing his Lily folder on the laptop . . . . All that adds\n      up to is little girls, ladies and gentlemen. You got a teacher sitting\n      here that\u2019s interested in little girls, because that\u2019s all he\u2019s got saved in\n      his collection. He\u2019s got it all backed up so if anything ever crashes,\n      he\u2019s got it in disk form, he\u2019s got it in thumbnail form. That\u2019s what\n      he\u2019s interested in, and that wasn\u2019t entrapment, because he was into\n      little girls a long time before he ever showed up in Kissimmee,\n      Florida.\n      You know it because that\u2019s what he likes to look at on the Internet, as\n      well.\n      Later in his closing argument, the prosecutor continued to invite the jury to\n\nconsider evidence admitted as to Counts 2\u20135 in connection with Count 1 as well:\n\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 25 of 101\n\n\n       He was predisposed. You know that from all of these videos and\n       pictures he likes to watch.\n\n       As Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote in Fulminante, a \u201cstructural defect\n\naffect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply [acting\n\nas] an error in the trial process itself. . . . [Where structural error exists] a criminal\n\ntrial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or\n\ninnocence, and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u201d\n\n499 U.S. at 310, 111 S. Ct. at 1265 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n\nVines, 28 F.3d at 1129 (\u201c[S]tructural defects . . . involve deprivations of\n\nconstitutional protections so basic that in their absence no criminal trial can be\n\ndeemed reliable, nor any punishment fundamentally fair.\u201d (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)). To examine the evidence separately as to each count\n\nwhen counsel has been denied makes little sense because we would have to\n\nspeculate about what evidence the jury may have applied in its deliberations as to\n\neach individual count, especially in a case like this one, where the charges are\n\ninterrelated and evidence relevant to one count may have influenced the jury as to\n\nothers.\n\n       Next, the dissent suggests that this case should be remanded for an\n\nevidentiary hearing to determine the circumstances surrounding counsel\u2019s absence\n\nfrom the courtroom during the presentation of evidence against Roy. Although\n\nJudge Boggs\u2019s dissent in Green (which reflects an almost identical yet condensed\n                                            25\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 26 of 101\n\n\nversion of the dissent that follows this opinion) made the same suggestion, the\n\nmajority in Green \u201cdecline[d] the State\u2019s invitation to remand for an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\u201d 809 F.2d at 1261. The majority found that \u201c[a]lthough it may be that\n\nsome absences by a criminal defendant\u2019s attorney might be so de minimis that there\n\nwould be no constitutional significance, the instant record unequivocally\n\ndemonstrates that [Green\u2019s attorney\u2019s] absence was not de minimis. In our view,\n\nthe record permits but one conclusion: [Green\u2019s] constitutional right to counsel\n\nwas implicated by [Green\u2019s lawyer\u2019s] absence.\u201d Id. at 1261\u201362. Contrary to the\n\ndissent, we do not state a blanket rule requiring automatic reversal on the occasion\n\nof any absence of counsel from the courtroom during the presentation of evidence\n\nagainst the defendant at his trial. But here, the absence of Roy\u2019s counsel from the\n\ncourtroom during the presentation of direct inculpatory testimony by a deputy\n\nsheriff who was the government\u2019s computer forensic specialist expert witness\n\ncannot reasonably be considered a de minimis constitutional violation.\n\n      In fact, Judge Boggs, the dissenter in Green, would seem to join the majority\n\nin this case. As Judge Boggs concedes, \u201c[t]he facts of this case are a long way\n\nfrom, for an extreme example, taking of direct testimony against a single defendant\n\nwhose counsel is absent.\u201d Id. at 1265 (Boggs, J., dissenting).\n\n      Our dissenting colleague next suggests that Roy\u2019s counsel \u201cmay have\n\ndeliberately taken advantage of his own tardiness and carefully avoided any\n\n                                         26\n\f              Case: 12-15093        Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 27 of 101\n\n\nattempt to correct the problem, hoping that he could have a get-out-of-jail-free card\n\nin his pocket for his client. If so, it worked.\u201d 6 Further, the dissent says that\n\ncounsel may have \u201cdeliberately engineered the whole thing\u201d and that our decision\n\ntoday could invite misconduct by opportunistic counsel, which, according to the\n\ndissent, is prevalent in the three states of the Eleventh Circuit as reflected by\n\nstatistics evidencing rampant lawyer misconduct in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama\n\nby criminal lawyers.\n\n       Our confidence in the integrity of lawyers, who are admitted to practice in\n\nour courtrooms as officers of the Court bound by rules of professional\n\nresponsibility, satisfies us that our decision today will not go so far as to motivate\n\nthem to place their licenses to practice law in jeopardy by, as the dissent suggests,\n\nstrategically slipping out of the courtroom when the judge is not looking and when\n\nthey think inculpatory evidence is coming, to invite reversible error in the event of\n\na conviction. Nor does the parade of horribles imagined by the dissent permit us to\n\ndisregard Cronic.\n\n       The dissent also maintains that judges are not like, in its words,\n\n\u201ckindergarten teachers, [who] will be forced to keep an eye on their lawyer-\n\nchildren.\u201d Contrary to that view, we are unpersuaded that United States District\n\n       6\n         Counsel is so clever, says the dissent, that he may have deliberately arranged the\nservices of another lawyer to argue this appeal rather than having to admit at oral argument that\nhe orchestrated the entire Cronic violation. The dissent infers too much to support such a\nconclusion.\n                                                27\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 28 of 101\n\n\nJudges should be excused from the less than onerous burden of ensuring that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s lawyer is seated at counsel table, next to his client, or is somewhere in\n\nthe courtroom when the government seeks the admission of incriminating evidence\n\nthat will be used by the jury to convict his client of a felony, resulting in life\n\nimprisonment. Especially in a trial with a single defendant who has a single\n\nlawyer.\n\n      We conclude that when the accused is deprived of his lawyer at a critical\n\nstage of his trial, there has been a denial of Sixth Amendment rights that makes the\n\nadversary process itself unreliable. The Constitution gives the defendant the right\n\nto \u201cthe guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.\u201d\n\nPowell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932). Accordingly,\n\ncounsel\u2019s absence during the admission of inculpatory evidence against Roy at his\n\ntrial is \u201c\u2018constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of\n\nwant of prejudice would cure it.\u2019\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S. Ct. at 2047\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting Alaska, 415 U.S. at 318, 94 S. Ct. at 1111).\n\n      Although we reverse and remand for a new trial, a reversal does not mean\n\nthat the defendant goes free. Rather, Roy will be retried in accordance with the\n\nrules of evidence and procedure, and without constitutional error.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\f             Case: 12-15093   Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 29 of 101\n\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Roy\u2019s convictions and remand for a\n\nnew trial.\n\n      REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 30 of 101\n\n\nED CARNES, Chief Judge, dissenting:\n\n      Returning late from a lunch break on the third day of a six-day trial, defense\n\ncounsel missed a small part of the testimony of the twelfth of thirteen government\n\nwitnesses. He was out of the courtroom for only seven of the 1,884 minutes, or\n\n31.4 hours, of the trial (not counting recesses and jury deliberations), which\n\namounts to less than one-half of one percent of the trial time. During his absence\n\ncounsel missed only 18 answers out of a total of approximately 2,745 answers that\n\nwere given by government witnesses during the trial, which means counsel missed\n\nless than one percent of the total number of answers given by witnesses for the\n\nprosecution. That\u2019s it. And all of the testimony that he missed was repeated in\n\neven more detail by the same witness after counsel returned to the courtroom.\n\n      So far as it appears from the record, the judge and the prosecutor did not\n\nnotice defense counsel\u2019s brief absence. When he returned to the courtroom,\n\ncounsel did not object to testimony having been taken in his absence. He did not\n\nask the court to strike the questions and answers that he had missed and instruct the\n\njury to disregard them. He apparently did not seek to have the questions and\n\nanswers he missed read back to him outside the presence of the jury so that he\n\ncould familiarize himself with them and object to any that were objectionable. For\n\nall that we can tell, counsel may have deliberately taken advantage of his own\n\ntardiness and carefully avoided any attempt to correct the problem, hoping that he\n\n                                         30\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 31 of 101\n\n\ncould have a get-out-of-jail-free card in his pocket for his client. If so, it worked.\n\nThe majority decides that the defendant\u2019s convictions for attempted child\n\nenticement and for possession of child pornography, most of which the defendant\n\nproduced himself, must be set aside because of his counsel\u2019s brief absence, even\n\nthough the record conclusively establishes that the absence could not possibly have\n\nprejudiced the defendant.\n\n      At oral argument, we could not ask the defendant\u2019s trial counsel about the\n\nfacts surrounding his absence from the courtroom, why he did not object, if he\n\nmade any off-the-record effort to familiarize himself with the testimony taken in\n\nhis absence, or anything else about the matter. The reason we could not ask what\n\nreally happened, and why, is that trial counsel conveniently did not represent the\n\ndefendant on appeal. Another attorney did. We could have remanded the case for\n\nan evidentiary hearing to find out all of the facts, but the majority refused my\n\nrequest to do that. The majority is content with only a swift sideways glance at the\n\nfacts because it thinks the facts can be presumed away. But \u201c[t]his is not a matter\n\nfor polite [or impolite] presumptions; we must look the facts in the face.\u201d Frank v.\n\nMangum, 237 U.S. 309, 349 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n\n      The majority\u2019s view, now the law of this circuit, is that if a witness gives any\n\ntestimony at all, even a single answer, supporting any count against the defendant\n\nwhile the defendant\u2019s attorney is outside the courtroom, reversal of every count of\n\n                                           31\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 32 of 101\n\n\nconviction is automatic. No matter what. Reversal is automatic regardless of the\n\nreason for the absence. Regardless of whether the trial judge or prosecutor noticed\n\nthe absence. Regardless of whether the answer given during the absence was\n\nobjectionable. Regardless of whether the defendant suffered any actual prejudice\n\nfrom counsel\u2019s absence. Regardless of whether counsel failed to object or seek\n\nany kind of corrective action. Regardless of whether counsel made a strategic\n\ndecision not to seek to correct the problem. Regardless of whether the first\n\nmention of the matter was on appeal. And regardless of whether counsel\n\ndeliberately engineered the whole thing. In other words, absence plus any\n\ninculpatory answer equals reversal regardless of any and all other facts and\n\ncircumstances.\n\n      The majority holds that no matter how strong the evidence of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s guilt, all a defense attorney has to do to guarantee an automatic\n\nreversal of his client\u2019s conviction on any and all counts is to be outside the\n\ncourtroom while a witness gives a single inculpatory answer on any count against\n\nhis client. The attorney can keep quiet about it until he sees what the verdict is and\n\nthen claim his right to have any convictions set aside. And under today\u2019s decision\n\nthey must be set aside.\n\n      In fact, under the majority\u2019s holding, it does not even matter if the attorney\n\nupon returning to the courtroom does object and does seek corrective action\n\n                                          32\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 33 of 101\n\n\nbecause as soon as a single answer is given in his absence an absolute, conclusive,\n\nirrebutable presumption of prejudice arises. Nothing can be done. The law today\u2019s\n\ndecision puts in place is that absence during any inculpatory testimony at all is all\n\nthat matters; no prejudice is required, no inquiry is allowed, no cure is permitted.\n\nOf course I dissent.\n\n      Because the facts do matter under a proper view of the law, Part I of this\n\nopinion summarizes the facts in order to show how defense counsel\u2019s brief absence\n\ncould not possibly have prejudiced Roy on any count. Part II explains why any\n\nclaim of error concerning Roy\u2019s trial is not Cronic error, and why the majority\u2019s\n\nunprecedented decision to the contrary is an extreme outlier. Part III addresses the\n\nfar reaching effects of this decision. Part IV lays out how we should have resolved\n\nthis case. It explains why any claim of error regarding defense counsel\u2019s\n\nmomentary absence should be subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, and\n\ngiven the failure to object, should be reviewed only for plain error. Applying that\n\nstandard, each of Roy\u2019s five convictions should be affirmed because he cannot\n\neven come close to showing that his lawyer\u2019s seven-minute absence, which\n\namounted to less than one-half of one percent of the trial\u2019s total length,\n\nprejudicially affected his substantial rights. Part IV also points out that even if we\n\nput aside the failure to object and do not restrict our review to plain error, any error\n\nstill would not be reversible because it was harmless.\n\n                                           33\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 34 of 101\n\n\n                            I. The Facts of the Matter\n\n      The transcripts of Roy\u2019s trial show that, during its case-in-chief, the\n\ngovernment questioned 13 witnesses who provided approximately 2,745 answers\n\nto questions while on the witness stand. Defense counsel was out of the courtroom\n\nfor only 18 of those answers and was present to hear 2,727 of them. The 18\n\nanswers that he missed were given during a seven-minute period in a trial that\n\nlasted 31.4 hours, not counting recesses and jury deliberations. To put it in\n\ncontext, defense counsel was out during less than one-half of one percent of the\n\ntrial time; he was out during less than one percent of the testimony that was given\n\nby the government\u2019s thirteen witnesses. Every answer given while counsel was\n\nabsent was repeated by the same witness after counsel returned, and trial counsel\n\nobjected to none of that testimony when it was reiterated in his presence.\n\n      To understand why defense counsel\u2019s brief absence did not prejudice Roy, it\n\nis important to consider the five charges against him. Count 1 was different in\n\nkind from Counts 2 \u2013 5. Count 1 charged Roy with attempted child enticement,\n\nbased on his efforts to arrange a sexual encounter with a fictitious 13-year-old girl\n\nin response to an internet ad posted by law enforcement. That charge did not\n\ninvolve any child pornography. And not a single question was asked about that\n\ncharge during counsel\u2019s absence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 35 of 101\n\n\n      Counts 2 \u2013 5 did involve child pornography. Each of those four counts\n\ncharged Roy with knowingly possessing \u201cany visual depiction\u201d of child\n\npornography, and the same pornographic photographs and videos of minors were\n\napparently used to prove each count. The difference in the counts is based on the\n\nfour different electronic devices Roy used to store those images: his desktop\n\ncomputer (Count 2); his laptop computer (Count 3); his USB thumb drive (Count\n\n4); and three of his CDs (Count 5). The statutory basis for each of those four\n\ncounts, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), (b)(2), required just one image, but the\n\nevidence proved without dispute that there were multiple pornographic\n\nphotographs and videos of multiple minors on each of the four devices. Each\n\ncount was proven many times over.\n\n A. The Testimony Presented During the First Two-and-a-Half Days of Trial\n                   Before Defense Counsel\u2019s Absence\n\n      During the first two days of the trial, with defense counsel present at all\n\ntimes, the government called ten witnesses who provided testimony focused almost\n\nexclusively on the attempted child enticement charge in Count 1. That testimony\n\nshowed that Roy, a middle school teacher, arranged a sexual encounter that he\n\nthought would involve a 13-year-old girl and her mother, and he drove to a pre-\n\narranged location to meet them so that he could have sex with the girl. The\n\ntestimony also showed that Roy went to the liaison prepared \u2013\u2013 with condoms and\n\n\n                                         35\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 36 of 101\n\n\nlubricant in his pockets. Roy\u2019s lawyer was in the courtroom for the entirety of\n\nthose first two days of trial and for the presentation of all of the testimony and\n\nevidence about Count 1. He did not miss anything about Count 1 on those or any\n\nother days. Yet the majority reverses that count of conviction anyway.\n\n      On the third day of trial, before the lunch break and in counsel\u2019s presence,\n\nthere was some additional testimony about Count 1, including the fact that Roy had\n\ntraveled more than an hour to get to the meeting place for the purpose of having\n\nsex with a 13-year-old girl. Much of the testimony that morning, however, went to\n\nCounts 2 \u2013 5 and concerned Roy\u2019s sexual relationship with L.B., the girl depicted\n\nin the pornographic images and videos that he had produced and stored on the four\n\nelectronic devices specified in those four counts. (As I have mentioned, there was\n\nalso child pornography stored on each of those devices that depicted other minors,\n\nwhich Roy had downloaded from the internet.)\n\n      Also on the morning of the third day of trial, with defense counsel present,\n\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement Agent William Kulp testified without\n\nobjection that L.B. was born on May 9, 1989. That means any pornography\n\ndepicting her that was produced before May 9, 2007 is child pornography. See 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2256(1) (defining \u201cminor\u201d for this purpose as anyone under 18 years of\n\nage). The principal at the high school L.B. had attended identified photos of her in\n\nvarious school yearbooks, three of which were admitted into evidence without\n\n                                          36\n\f             Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 37 of 101\n\n\nobjection. The purpose of that testimony was to permit the jury to compare how\n\nL.B. looked at various ages with the depictions of her in the pornography.\n\n      The third and final witness to be called before the lunch break on the third\n\nday was Deputy Sheriff Charlie Longson, a computer forensics expert. In defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s presence, he testified extensively about his qualifications and how he\n\nforensically examines a computer. He also testified about the user and\n\nemail/messenger accounts he found on Roy\u2019s desktop computer which, among\n\nother things, was used to get into evidence Roy\u2019s email conversations setting up\n\nthe sexual liaison with the 13 year old and the sexually oriented instant messenger\n\nconversations between Roy and L.B. that were on that computer. Longson\u2019s\n\ntestimony was interrupted by a lunch break.\n\n      Again, all of the testimony recounted so far occurred during the first two-\n\nand-a-half days of the trial, while Roy\u2019s counsel was continuously present in the\n\ncourtroom.\n\n B. The Testimony Presented During Defense Counsel\u2019s Brief Absence After\n                    Lunch on the Third Day of Trial\n\n      Defense counsel returned late from the lunch break on that third day and\n\nmissed seven minutes of the testimony of Deputy Longson. During the seven\n\nminutes counsel was out of the courtroom, Longson gave 18 answers to the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s questions. All of those 18 answers concerned only six of the\n\n\n                                         37\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 38 of 101\n\n\nnumerous images of child pornography. All six of those images were of L.B. and\n\nwere found in only one of the several file folders containing child pornography on\n\nRoy\u2019s desktop computer. That folder had been labeled \u201c2006-03-11.\u201d Longson\n\ntestified that those six images depicted \u201ca nude white female . . . bound to a table\n\nby her feet with rope\u201d and with \u201can orange cloth . . . secured around her neck with\n\nsilver duct tape.\u201d He also testified that those six images were taken with a Kodak\n\nv530 Zoom Digital Camera on March 10, 2005, were initially uploaded onto a\n\ncomputer on March 11, 2006, and were then transferred to Roy\u2019s desktop computer\n\non April 4, 2009. All of that testimony was about facts that had been disclosed to\n\nthe defense two months before trial in Longson\u2019s forensic lab report. During the\n\nseven minutes while defense counsel was out, no exhibits were admitted into\n\nevidence and Longson did not identify L.B. as the female in the pornographic\n\nimages.\n\n     C. The Testimony Presented After Defense Counsel\u2019s Return to the\n                 Courtroom Following His Brief Absence\n\n      Defense counsel returned to the courtroom following those seven minutes of\n\ntestimony, which covered only three transcript pages. The prosecutor then\n\ncontinued questioning Longson for 69 more pages of the transcript, he was cross-\n\nexamined by defense counsel for 45 more pages, and his re-direct testimony covers\n\n19 more pages. Adding those numbers to Longson\u2019s 42 pages of testimony before\n\n\n                                          38\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 39 of 101\n\n\nthe lunch break, his testimony spans two days and covers 133 pages of the\n\ntranscript, only three pages of which occurred in defense counsel\u2019s brief absence.\n\n      The testimony Longson gave during the seven minutes defense counsel was\n\nnot there, all of which concerned only six of the multiple images of child\n\npornography, was repeated immediately after counsel returned to the courtroom.\n\nAfter defense counsel entered the courtroom, the prosecutor approached Longson\n\nwith 10 exhibits that included, among others, the six images Longson had found in\n\nthe \u201c2006-03-11\u201d folder on Roy\u2019s desktop computer. Longson then described in\n\ndetail what each image depicted, and testified that they had been created on March\n\n11, 2006, and uploaded onto Roy\u2019s desktop computer on April 4, 2009. Those\n\nimages showed the then-16-year-old L.B. \u201cbound to a table by her feet with\n\na . . . red and white ski rope\u201d; she was wearing an \u201corange hood across her head\n\nwith silver duct tape secured around the neck\u201d; there was a \u201cdildo inserted in her\n\nvagina\u201d and \u201ca male\u2019s penis . . . suspended above [her] body.\u201d (A few pages later\n\nin the transcript, Longson repeated his earlier testimony that all of the images of\n\nL.B. on Roy\u2019s desktop had been taken with a Kodak v530 Zoom Digital Camera.)\n\nAt the time those images of L.B. were taken, she was a minor for purposes of the\n\nchild pornography charges against Roy in Counts 2 \u2013 5 because she was under 18\n\nyears of age. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(1). The ten images were admitted into\n\nevidence without objection while defense counsel was present.\n\n                                          39\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 40 of 101\n\n\n      Being present during all of the testimony recounted in the preceding\n\nparagraph, Roy\u2019s trial counsel had an opportunity to object to the testimony or\n\nadmission of the exhibits into evidence, but he did not object. Likewise, Roy\u2019s\n\nappellate counsel has not suggested any basis for objecting to the testimony or to\n\nthe admission of the exhibits. Their failure to do so shows that trial counsel\u2019s\n\nseven-minute absence when the same testimony was given by the same witness\n\nearlier (and no exhibits were admitted) did not deprive the defense of an\n\nopportunity to lodge a valid objection to any testimony or evidence.\n\n      After repeating in defense counsel\u2019s presence all of the testimony he had\n\nmissed, Longson testified for the first time about other pornographic images of\n\nL.B. that he had found on Roy\u2019s desktop, laptop, thumb drive, and CDs. None of\n\nthose other images had been mentioned in counsel\u2019s absence. With counsel\n\npresent, Longson described a series of three images found on Roy\u2019s desktop in a\n\nseparate file folder labeled \u201c2006-02-04,\u201d which featured L.B. lying naked in a\n\nbathtub with \u201cAlex\u2019s Little Cunt\u201d written in \u201cblack ink both on [her] chest between\n\nthe breasts and then on [her] stomach over the naval.\u201d Longson testified that those\n\nimages were taken on December 2, 2006, when L.B. indisputably would have been\n\nonly 17 years old, which means she was a minor for purposes of the child\n\npornography charges against Roy in Counts 2 \u2013 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 41 of 101\n\n\n      With defense counsel present, Longson also testified about finding on Roy\u2019s\n\ndesktop and laptop numerous videos of L.B. that had been made between October\n\nand December 2006 using a Kodak v530 Zoom Digital Camera, and it was\n\nundisputed that L.B. would have been 17 years old during that time. Some of\n\nthose videos showed: L.B. bound and blindfolded with a \u201cbody net covering her\n\nbody\u201d and \u201ca red dildo inserted into her anus\u201d; L.B. \u201cfully nude\u201d with a \u201cdildo in\n\nher vagina\u201d while she \u201cperform[ed] fellatio on a white male\u201d; L.B. \u201cfully nude\u201d\n\nwith a \u201cvibrator in her vagina\u201d while a white male \u201cattempt[ed] to have annal [sic]\n\nsex with her\u201d; L.B. performing fellatio after removing a \u201cschool-girl outfit\u201d; L.B.\n\nhaving sexual intercourse with a man while she was tied up; and L.B. lying \u201cnude\n\nin [a] bathtub\u201d with \u201cAlex\u2019s little cunt\u201d scrawled across her chest and stomach\n\nwhile a man urinated on her.\n\n      Longson described each of those videos and they were admitted into\n\nevidence. Although defense counsel was present during all of that testimony and\n\nadmission of exhibits, he never objected to any of it. And Roy\u2019s appellate counsel\n\nhas not suggested to us that there was any basis for objecting to that testimony or\n\nto the admission of those videos into evidence.\n\n      Longson\u2019s testimony about the child pornography he found on Roy\u2019s\n\ndesktop, laptop, USB drive, and CDs was not limited to images and videos of L.B.\n\nLongson also testified about finding several images of downloaded child\n\n                                         41\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 42 of 101\n\n\npornography in temporary internet files on Roy\u2019s desktop computer, as well as\n\npornographic images of minors stored elsewhere on his electronic devices,\n\nincluding files named \u201cKingpouge_14,\u201d \u201cVica_16,\u201d and \u201cSvet_16.\u201d Longson\n\nspecifically described how one of those images showed \u201ctwo or three subjects\n\nunder the age of 18 engaged in sexual activity with two men.\u201d These were images\n\nof minors other than L.B., and they were admitted into evidence. Although he was\n\npresent during all of that testimony, defense counsel never objected to any of it,\n\nand Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has not suggested to us any ground for keeping it out.\n\n      The importance of the unrefuted testimony and evidence about the child\n\npornography involving minors other than L.B., all of which was admitted while\n\ndefense counsel was present, is that any one of those images was enough by itself\n\nto prove each of the charges contained in Counts 2 \u2013 5, because all the statute\n\nrequires is one \u201cvisual depiction\u201d of child pornography. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2252(a)(4). That means that even if all of the testimony involving L.B. were\n\nstruck from the record because defense counsel was out of the courtroom while a\n\nsmall part of that testimony was first given, the Count 2 \u2013 5 charges against Roy\n\nwere still conclusively proven. They were conclusively proven by the testimony\n\nand other evidence concerning child pornography depicting minors other than L.B.,\n\nall of which came in during counsel\u2019s presence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 43 of 101\n\n\n      Once the prosecution completed its direct examination of Longson, defense\n\ncounsel thoroughly and vigorously cross-examined him over the course of 45\n\npages of the trial transcript. Counsel attempted to challenge Longson\u2019s testimony\n\nthat the photographs and videos of L.B. were created when she was under the age\n\nof 18. His challenge fell short, however, because Longson explained that data\n\nembedded in the photographs and videos of L.B. showed that they had been taken\n\nwith a Kodak digital camera on a date when L.B. was a minor. Significantly,\n\ndefense counsel did not even attempt during cross-examination or elsewhere to\n\nchallenge Longson\u2019s testimony about the pornographic images involving minors\n\nother than L.B., and any one of those images on the devices was enough to convict\n\nRoy on Counts 2 \u2013 5.\n\n      On the fourth day of trial, the government called its last witness and then\n\nrested. The defense called a few witnesses, including Robert Deane Moody, its\n\nown computer forensics expert. He testified that there were reported problems\n\nwith the battery life of the Kodak camera model that Roy had used to produce the\n\nimages of L.B., which would cause the camera\u2019s internal clock to reset to its\n\ndefault date and time if the camera\u2019s battery went dead. If the internal clock in the\n\ncamera used to create the images of L.B. had reset, it was possible that the creation\n\ndates that Deputy Longson had noted for the L.B. images and videos might be\n\ninaccurate. Moody conceded, however, that the problems were not necessarily\n\n                                         43\n\f              Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 44 of 101\n\n\npresent in all of those models of the Kodak camera and that Roy\u2019s may not have\n\nhad any battery issues anyway. He admitted that the names of the computer\n\nfolders in which the L.B. images were stored (i.e., \u201c2006-03-11\u201d and \u201c2006-10-\n\n13\u201d) were all consistent with the creation dates that the camera had embedded in\n\nthose images. He also admitted that the images and videos were numbered\n\nsequentially and showed no signs of reverting back to an earlier date. And none of\n\nhis testimony concerned the numerous other images of child pornography that were\n\nfound on Roy\u2019s four electronic devices, any one of which was enough to prove his\n\nguilt.\n\n II. Defense Counsel\u2019s Absence for Less Than One-Half of One Percent of the\n                        Trial Was Not Cronic Error\n\n         This part proceeds in four sections to explain why Cronic\u2019s presumption of\n\nprejudice does not apply in this case. Section A reviews the Cronic decision and\n\nrelated Supreme Court precedent and shows how trial counsel\u2019s seven-minute\n\nabsence during a six-day trial is far removed from the narrow and extreme\n\ncircumstances in which the Cronic presumption is appropriate. Section B\n\ndiscusses the meaning of a \u201ccritical stage,\u201d a meaning vital to consideration of\n\nCronic in this case, and explains how the majority\u2019s extreme definition of \u201cstage\u201d\n\nruns counter to common sense and precedent. Section C recognizes, as this Court\n\nsitting en banc has held, that Cronic\u2019s presumption is reserved for \u201conly a very\n\n\n                                          44\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 45 of 101\n\n\nnarrow spectrum of cases\u201d where the adversary process is presumptively\n\nunreliable, and it explains how the record plainly shows that there is nothing\n\nunreliable about Roy\u2019s trial and his convictions. Section D discusses decisions\n\nfrom other circuits that have addressed whether Cronic applies to temporary\n\nabsences of an attorney from trial, and it shows that today\u2019s decision is an extreme\n\noutlier. It also discusses why courts are capable of determining whether brief\n\nattorney absences are prejudicial.\n\n                          A. Supreme Court Precedent\n\n      The majority\u2019s conclusion that defense counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence\n\nduring a six-day trial requires a presumption of prejudice is unprecedented and\n\nwrong. Cronic carved out only a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the general requirement\n\nthat a defendant must affirmatively prove prejudice from an error involving\n\ncounsel; the presumption of prejudice it created is limited to circumstances so\n\ngrave that they amount to a total failure or complete deprivation of counsel. See\n\nVines v. United States, 28 F.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir. 1994); see also United States\n\nv. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2047 (1984); Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067 (1984); Stano v. Dugger,\n\n921 F.2d 1125, 1153 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc) (\u201cCronic\u2019s presumption of\n\nprejudice applies to only a very narrow spectrum of cases where the circumstances\n\nleading to counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness are so egregious that the defendant was in\n\n                                         45\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 46 of 101\n\n\neffect denied any meaningful assistance at all.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted)\n\n(emphasis added). Those circumstances include \u201cthe complete denial of counsel\u201d\n\nat a \u201ccritical stage of [the] trial\u201d and counsel\u2019s \u201centire[] fail[ure] to subject the\n\nprosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104\n\nS.Ct. at 2047 (emphasis added).\n\n       For example, the Court in Cronic cited Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52,\n\n82 S.Ct. 157 (1961), where prejudice was presumed when the defendant was\n\nentirely denied any counsel at his arraignment, and White v. Maryland, 373 U.S.\n\n59, 83 S.Ct. 1050 (1963), where prejudice was presumed after the defendant was\n\nentirely denied counsel at a preliminary hearing. Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104\n\nS.Ct. at 2047. Here, by contrast, defense counsel was present during more than\n\n99.5% of Roy\u2019s trial, which can hardly be characterized as the \u201ccomplete denial of\n\ncounsel\u201d at a critical stage or an \u201centire[] fail[ure] to subject the prosecution\u2019s case\n\nto meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d See id. Counsel vigorously represented Roy.\n\nAmong other things, he cross-examined Deputy Longson for 45 pages of the trial\n\ntranscript and called his own competing expert witness to undermine Longson\u2019s\n\ntestimony.\n\n       Given the \u201cvery narrow spectrum of cases\u201d to which the Cronic exception to\n\nthe actual prejudice requirement applies, we have held en banc that the burden of\n\nestablishing that an error warrants Cronic\u2019s presumption of prejudice is \u201ca very\n\n                                            46\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 47 of 101\n\n\nheavy one.\u201d Stano, 921 F.2d at 1153 (quotation marks omitted). Both the\n\ndifficulty of carrying that \u201cvery heavy\u201d burden and the \u201cvery narrow\u201d scope of the\n\nCronic exception are evident from the fact that the Supreme Court has repeatedly\n\nrefused to apply it. For example, the Court has held that the Cronic exception did\n\nnot apply, and the usual showing of actual prejudice was required, where trial\n\ncounsel failed to present any mitigating evidence or any final argument during the\n\npenalty phase of a capital trial. Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 692\u201398, 122 S.Ct.\n\n1843, 1849\u201352 (2002). The Court also has held that Cronic did not apply, and a\n\nshowing of actual prejudice was required, where trial counsel without the\n\ndefendant\u2019s consent conceded that the defendant was guilty of capital murder.\n\nFlorida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 178, 190\u201391, 125 S.Ct. 551, 555, 562\u201363 (2004).\n\nNot once in the thirty years since the Cronic decision was issued has the Supreme\n\nCourt ever found that its presumptive prejudice rule applied. The scope of the rule\n\nis that narrow; the burden of showing that it applies is that heavy.\n\n      Even in the Cronic case itself, the Court did not find that the Cronic\n\nexception applied. That case involved a woefully inexperienced, young attorney\n\nwho had been appointed counsel in a complex mail fraud case only 25 days before\n\ntrial, a case that the government had investigated for over four-and-a-half years\n\nduring which it reviewed thousands of documents. Cronic, 466 U.S. at 649, 662\u2013\n\n66, 104 S.Ct. at 2041, 2049\u201351. Despite those extreme facts, the Court refused to\n\n                                          47\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 48 of 101\n\n\npresume prejudice, requiring instead that the defendant show that he actually was\n\nprejudiced. The Supreme Court\u2019s insistence on confining the Cronic exception to\n\nnarrow boundaries is evident from the fact that in Bell, Nixon, and Cronic itself the\n\nCourt reversed the decisions of lower courts that had presumed prejudice. See\n\nNixon, 543 U.S. at 189\u201393, 125 S.Ct. at 561\u201363; Bell, 535 U.S. at 688, 702, 122\n\nS.Ct. at 1847, 1854; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666\u201367, 104 S.Ct. at 2051. And in all of\n\nthose cases, the risk of prejudice to the defendant was much greater than the risk of\n\nprejudice to Roy from his lawyer\u2019s seven-minute absence during a six-day trial.\n\n      The opinions in Cronic and Strickland indicate that Cronic\u2019s narrow\n\nexception to the requirement that actual prejudice be shown rests in large part on\n\nconsiderations of judicial economy applicable only to rare circumstances. See\n\nCronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046 (\u201cThere are, however, circumstances\n\nthat are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a\n\nparticular case is unjustified.\u201d) (emphasis added); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692, 104\n\nS.Ct. at 2067 (\u201cPrejudice in these [Cronic] circumstances is so likely that case-by-\n\ncase inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost.\u201d) (emphasis added). The rare\n\ncircumstances are those in which the likelihood of prejudice is so high that there is\n\nno point in wasting time looking into it. This case does not involve one of those\n\nrare circumstances any more than the Bell, Nixon, and Cronic cases did.\n\nB. A Single Inculpatory Question and Answer Does Not Qualify as a \u201cStage\u201d\n                                of a Trial\n                                            48\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 49 of 101\n\n\n\n\n      The majority\u2019s strategy for escaping the narrow confines of Cronic, a\n\ndecision which presumes prejudice only when defense counsel is absent or not\n\nfunctioning as counsel for an entire stage of a criminal trial, is to fragment the\n\nmeaning of \u201cstage\u201d so that any and every inculpatory answer, or any eighteen out\n\nof 2,745 of them in this case, is a separate stage of the case. While that\n\nextraordinary view serves the purpose of converting Cronic\u2019s \u201cvery narrow\u201d\n\nexception into a very broad one, it is indefensible. Under the majority\u2019s view the\n\ntrial is not a stage of the case, it is instead a collection of hundreds or thousands of\n\nstages depending on its length. Every time a witness, whether a government\n\nwitness on direct examination or a defense witness on cross-examination, provides\n\nan inculpatory answer, a separate stage of the trial has occurred, according to the\n\nmajority. That means, in this case with 2,745 answers from witnesses for the\n\ngovernment, the presentation of the government\u2019s case was not a stage of the case\n\nbut instead was more than two thousand stages of the case. See Maj. Opn. at 11\u2013\n\n13. That is the only way the majority can conclude that because Roy\u2019s counsel\n\nmissed 18 answers out of 2,745 that government witnesses gave, he was absent\n\nduring a critical \u201cstage\u201d of the trial, or actually during eighteen critical stages.\n\n      The majority\u2019s definition distorts the common meaning of the word \u201cstage.\u201d\n\nSee Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 1853 (2d ed. 2001)\n\n(defining \u201cstage\u201d as \u201ca particular phase, period, position, etc., in a process,\n                                           49\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 50 of 101\n\n\ndevelopment, or series\u201d). When we use the word \u201cstage\u201d in our everyday life, and\n\nthroughout the law, we do not mean to refer to fleeting moments or small slices of\n\nevents. Instead, we use the word to refer to larger component parts of a process\n\nthat share a common characteristic. For example, adolescence is considered a\n\nstage of life; but we would never speak of every minute, hour, or day of an\n\nadolescent\u2019s life as a stage of his life. But that is what the majority is doing in this\n\ncase. A stage is not a stage, in its view, but instead is every small part of every\n\nsingle component of all the phases of a stage. That does not make sense.\n\n      Distorting the definition of \u201cstage\u201d eviscerates Cronic\u2019s requirement that\n\nthere be \u201ca complete denial of counsel\u201d \u201cat a critical stage of his trial\u201d before a\n\npresumption of prejudice applies. Cronic, 466 U.S at 659, 104 S.Ct. at 2047.\n\nDenial of counsel during less than one-half of one percent of a trial, for only seven\n\nminutes of a 31.4 hour-long trial, can hardly be called a \u201ccomplete denial of\n\ncounsel\u201d during \u201ca critical stage\u201d of the trial. If that is \u201ca complete denial of\n\ncounsel\u201d during a critical stage, what would a partial denial of counsel look like?\n\nWhat would denial of counsel for less than an entire stage of a trial be?\n\n      Only by shrinking \u201ccritical stage of [the defendant\u2019s] trial\u201d to an\n\nindefensibly tiny fraction of what it means can the majority reach the result it does\n\nin today\u2019s decision. If we defined the stage to be the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief,\n\nthere would not be a complete denial of counsel because Roy\u2019s attorney was absent\n\n                                           50\n\f             Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 51 of 101\n\n\nfor only a small sliver of the government\u2019s case. If we defined the stage to be the\n\ntestimony of any of the government\u2019s 13 witnesses, there would not be a complete\n\ndenial of counsel because Roy\u2019s attorney missed only a few answers of the\n\ntestimony of one of those witnesses. Even if we fragmented \u201cstage\u201d down to the\n\ndirect examination of any of the government\u2019s 13 witnesses, there would still not\n\nbe a complete denial of counsel because Roy\u2019s attorney was present during the vast\n\nmajority of Deputy Longson\u2019s direct examination.\n\n      The majority\u2019s redefinition of the word \u201cstage\u201d finds no support in the\n\nSupreme Court decisions in this area. Instead, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions\n\nshow that it understands \u201cstage,\u201d as it used the term in Cronic, to mean a broader,\n\nqualitatively distinct phase of a criminal proceeding, such as a post-indictment\n\nlineup or interrogation, an arraignment, a plea or other pretrial hearing, closing\n\narguments as a whole, and sentencing. See Missouri v. Frye, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct.\n\n1399, 1407 (2012) (plea negotiations as a critical stage); Montejo v. Louisiana, 556\n\nU.S. 778, 786, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2085 (2009) (post-indictment interrogation as a\n\ncritical stage); Iowa v.

Florida,\n\n430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1205 (1977) (sentencing as a critical stage);\n\n                                          51\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 52 of 101\n\n\nHerring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 863, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 2555 (1975) (invalidating\n\na statute that allowed a trial judge \u201cto deny absolutely the opportunity for any\n\nclosing summation at all\u201d); Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 683, 92 S.Ct. 1877,\n\n1879 (1972) (post-indictment lineup as a critical stage); Hamilton, 368 U.S. at 54\u2013\n\n55, 82 S.Ct. at 158\u201359 (complete absence of counsel from the defendant\u2019s\n\narraignment); White, 373 U.S. at 59-60, 83 S.Ct. at 1051 (complete absence of\n\ncounsel from a preliminary hearing).\n\n      The Supreme Court has never suggested for a moment that a single\n\ninculpatory question and answer, or a handful of them, is an independent or\n\nseparate \u201cstage\u201d of a criminal proceeding, nor has it ever suggested that a critical\n\nstage can, or should, be subdivided into countless sub-stages. For example, in\n\nGilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 267, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1953 (1967), the Supreme\n\nCourt analyzed whether the whole process of taking handwriting exemplars\n\nqualified as a critical stage, not whether each stroke of the defendant\u2019s pen was its\n\nown distinct stage. And in United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 236\u201337, 87 S.Ct.\n\n1926, 1937 (1967), the Court decided whether a post-indictment lineup, considered\n\nas a whole, was a critical stage of criminal proceedings, not whether each glance of\n\nthe witness at the defendant or other moment was itself a stage.\n\n      Today\u2019s decision is the first time that an appellate court has subdivided a\n\nstage of criminal proceedings into hundreds or thousands of smaller stages and\n\n                                          52\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 53 of 101\n\n\ncalled them all critical. See, e.g., United States v. Ross, 703 F.3d 856, 873\u201374 (6th\n\nCir. 2012) (analyzing whether a competency hearing qualified as a critical stage);\n\nMcNeal v. Adams, 623 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that a hearing on\n\na motion to compel the defendant to provide a DNA sample was not a critical stage\n\nafter considering several factors that might \u201cmake a proceeding a critical stage\u201d)\n\n(emphasis added); McDowell v. Kingston, 497 F.3d 757, 762\u201363 (7th Cir. 2007)\n\n(discussing whether the complete testimony of a defendant constituted a critical\n\nstage of his trial); Harrington v. Gillis, 456 F.3d 118, 132 (3d Cir. 2006) (noting\n\nthat \u201can appeal is a critical stage of criminal proceedings\u201d) (emphasis added);\n\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that a\n\n\u201cplea withdrawal hearing\u201d was a critical stage) (emphasis added); United States v.\n\nBranch, 91 F.3d 699, 723 (5th Cir. 1996) (analyzing whether a pre-verdict bench\n\nconference was a critical stage of the criminal proceedings); United States v.\n\nHicks, 948 F.2d 877, 885 (4th Cir. 1991) (analyzing whether \u201ca routine\n\npresentence interview\u201d qualified as a critical stage of the criminal proceedings)\n\n(emphasis added); United States v. Sayeedi, 903 F.2d 88, 91 (2d Cir. 1990) (noting\n\nthat jury selection is a critical stage and not analyzing whether every question\n\nasked and answer given during voir dire qualified as an independent critical stage).\n\n      Even the decision that the majority relies on for its \u201cworking definition\u201d of a\n\ncritical stage did not define \u201cstage\u201d the way the majority does. See Van v. Jones,\n\n                                          53\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 54 of 101\n\n\n475 F.3d 292 (6th Cir. 2007). In Van, the Sixth Circuit addressed whether a\n\n\u201cconsolidation hearing\u201d qualified as a critical stage of the proceedings against the\n\ndefendant. Id. at 293. The question, as the court framed it, was not whether seven\n\nminutes of that hearing amounted to a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d Nor was the question\n\nwhether a single statement made during the hearing was a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d Instead,\n\nthe question in the Sixth Circuit\u2019s view was whether the entire hearing, which\n\nVan\u2019s attorney had missed, was a critical stage.\n\n      The majority also relies on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s en banc decision in Burdine v.\n\nJohnson for its definition of a critical stage, but in that decision the Fifth Circuit\n\nemphasized that \u201cstages\u201d are broader proceedings. 262 F.3d 336, 347 (5th Cir.\n\n2001) (\u201cTo justify a particular stage as critical, the Court has not required the\n\ndefendant to explain how having counsel would have altered the outcome of his\n\nspecific case. Rather, the Court has looked to whether the substantial rights of a\n\ndefendant may be affected during that type of proceeding.\u201d) (quotation marks\n\nomitted) (emphasis added). There is no support in either the decisions of the\n\nSupreme Court or of other federal appellate courts for the majority\u2019s extraordinary\n\ndefinition of a stage of a criminal proceeding for Cronic critical stage purposes.\n\n  C. The Adversary Process of Roy\u2019s Trial Was Not Unreliable and Roy Did\n                           Not Suffer Prejudice\n\n      As the Supreme Court has explained, Cronic\u2019s rarely applicable presumption\n\nis reserved for Sixth Amendment violations that are so serious that they \u201cmake[]\n                                           54\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 55 of 101\n\n\nthe adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659,\n\n104 S.Ct. at 2047; see also Hammonds v. Newsome, 816 F.2d 611, 613 (11th Cir.\n\n1987) (\u201cThis Court has stated that the presumptive prejudice approach of the\n\nCronic dictum applies to a narrow range of cases where there is a fundamental\n\nbreakdown of the adversarial process.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); Chadwick v.\n\nGreen, 740 F.2d 897, 900 (11th Cir. 1984) (\u201cCircumstances which would warrant a\n\npresumption of prejudice . . . are those where \u2018the adversary process itself is\n\n[rendered] presumptively unreliable [by the circumstances].\u2019\u201d) (alterations in\n\noriginal) (footnote omitted); United States v. Russell, 205 F.3d 768, 771 (5th Cir.\n\n2000). The trial record in this case makes it abundantly clear that the adversary\n\nprocess leading to Roy\u2019s convictions on each of the five counts against him was\n\nnot unreliable, much less presumptively so. Roy suffered no prejudice on any\n\ncount because of his attorney\u2019s seven-minute absence from the 1,884-minute trial,\n\nand the majority\u2019s conjecture that the testimony presented during counsel\u2019s brief\n\nabsence \u201ccontributed to [Roy\u2019s] conviction,\u201d Maj. Opn. at 1, ignores the evidence\n\nin the record.\n\n      The majority\u2019s refusal to take a hard look at whether there was a real\n\npossibility of actual prejudice also runs counter to the nature of a critical stage. As\n\nthe Seventh Circuit has explained, whether part of a criminal prosecution is a\n\ncritical stage \u201cdepends itself to some degree on a prejudice analysis.\u201d United\n\n                                          55\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 56 of 101\n\n\nStates v. Morrison, 946 F.2d 484, 503 n.5 (7th Cir. 1991) (\u201cWe note that despite\n\nCronic\u2019s insistence on a presumption of prejudice in certain cases, the definition of\n\na prosecution[]\u2019s critical stage\u2014and hence the determination of whether a\n\nprejudice presumption applies\u2014depends itself to some degree on a prejudice\n\nanalysis. Even when engaging in a Cronic inquiry, then, we are never completely\n\nloosed from the factual moorings of the case before us. The notion that Cronic and\n\nits progeny completely obviate the need for any inquiry into the potential for\n\nprejudice is thus not entirely accurate.\u201d). To borrow the Seventh Circuit\u2019s apt\n\nwords, the analysis in the majority opinion is \u201ccompletely loosed from the factual\n\nmoorings of the case before us.\u201d\n\n      As I have pointed out, all of the evidence of Roy\u2019s guilt on Count 1, the\n\nattempted child enticement charge, was presented while defense counsel was\n\npresent. He did not miss any of it. The brief testimony that did occur while\n\ncounsel was momentarily out of the courtroom went only to Counts 2 \u2013 5; those\n\nfour counts involved conduct that was not even discovered by the police until after\n\nRoy was arrested on the attempted child enticement charge and his house was\n\nsearched. The charges in Counts 2 \u2013 5 were separate from and independent of the\n\nCount 1 charge. See supra Part I.\n\n      Roy\u2019s defense theory on Count 1 was that the police had entrapped him in\n\nthe reverse sting operation. He asserted in closing argument that it had been the\n\n                                         56\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 57 of 101\n\n\npolice who were \u201cdoing the enticing.\u201d The majority believes that the six images of\n\nL.B. that were partially discussed while defense counsel was absent were relevant\n\nto Roy\u2019s entrapment defense to Count 1 because the government argued in closing\n\nargument that all of the images, including the ones discussed during counsel\u2019s\n\nabsence, showed Roy\u2019s proclivity for having sex with underage girls. See Maj.\n\nOpn. at 22\u201323. There are two reasons why that prejudice theory is unconvincing.\n\nOne reason is that those same six images were discussed in much greater detail and\n\nlength after counsel returned to the courtroom and, in fact, the six images were\n\nadmitted into evidence (without objection) only after counsel returned. Anything\n\nthat the initial testimony about those six images showed about Roy\u2019s proclivity\n\nwas also shown through the testimony taken and the images that were admitted\n\ninto evidence while counsel was there.\n\n       The other reason this possibility of prejudice through proclivity theory is\n\nunconvincing is that those six images of L.B. were only a small fraction of the total\n\nnumber of hardcore photographic and video images of her that were discussed and\n\nadmitted into evidence. The vast majority of the testimony about those six images\n\nof L.B. and all of the testimony about the numerous other pornographic images of\n\nL.B. took place after counsel returned to the courtroom. Counsel had the\n\nopportunity to cross-examine the witness, and he did cross-examine him for 45\n\npages of the trial transcript.\n\n                                           57\n\f              Case: 12-15093        Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 58 of 101\n\n\n       Not only that, but there were also numerous pornographic images of other\n\nminor females found on Roy\u2019s electronic devices. Every bit of the testimony about\n\nall of that non-L.B. child pornography came in while defense counsel was present.\n\nAnd every one of the images of child pornography \u2013\u2013 of L.B. and of other minors\n\n\u2013\u2013 was admitted into evidence without objection while defense counsel was\n\npresent. Roy\u2019s proclivity was overwhelmingly proven by testimony given and\n\nevidence admitted in the presence of his counsel.\n\n       When the government argued against Roy\u2019s entrapment defense at closing, it\n\ndid not tell the jury to consider only the six images that Deputy Longson had\n\nmentioned while defense counsel was absent. Instead it asked the jury to consider\n\nall of the images and videos, stating: \u201cHe was predisposed. You know that from\n\nall of these videos and pictures he likes to watch.\u201d There is no doubt, and no\n\nreason to doubt, that the adversarial process leading to Roy\u2019s conviction on the\n\nCount 1 charge was reliable, and he was not prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s seven-\n\nminute absence during which that charge did not even come up. 1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The majority claims that I contend that Roy\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count 1\nshould stand \u201ceven if counsel\u2019s absence taints the conviction as to Counts 2\u20135\u201d because \u201cwe can\nseparate out the evidence as to each count.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 23. Just to be clear, my position is that\ncounsel\u2019s absence did not taint any of Roy\u2019s convictions, including the convictions on Counts 2\u2013\n5. Period. And the very fact that we can easily separate out the evidence as to each count in this\ncase is a persuasive indication that the error in Roy\u2019s trial was not Cronic error. Because there\nwas no Cronic error, there is no presumption of prejudice.\n                                                58\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 59 of 101\n\n\n      There is also no question that the adversarial process leading to Roy\u2019s\n\nconvictions on Counts 2 \u2013 5 was reliable. Again, those counts were organized by\n\ndifferent devices \u2014 a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a USB thumb drive,\n\nand three CDs \u2014 that were found in Roy\u2019s home and all of which contained child\n\npornography. To convict him on Counts 2 \u2013 5, the jury had to find only that he\n\npossessed the named device and that he knew it contained at least one image of\n\nchild pornography. Roy has never denied possessing each of those devices, nor\n\nhas he ever denied that there was child pornography on them.\n\n      Roy\u2019s defense theory was that all of the L.B. images were taken after her\n\neighteenth birthday. The evidence overwhelmingly disproved that theory, but even\n\nif the jury had somehow accepted it, even if we totally disregard not just the six\n\nimages of L.B. that were discussed in counsel\u2019s absence but all of the L.B. images,\n\nthe other child pornography on Roy\u2019s various electronic devices establishes his\n\nguilt of the charges contained in Counts 2 \u2013 5. And none of that other child\n\npornography was discussed, mentioned, or even alluded to during the seven\n\nminutes while defense counsel was outside the courtroom. All of the evidence\n\nabout that other child pornography came in without objection during the 1,877\n\nminutes, or more than 31 hours, that counsel was present and fully participating in\n\nthe trial. Because of that evidence, Roy would have been just as guilty of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\f               Case: 12-15093         Date Filed: 08/05/2014        Page: 60 of 101\n\n\nCount 2 \u2013 5 charges if the pornographic images and videos of L.B. had never been\n\nmentioned, never been discovered, never existed.\n\n       The majority seeks to render irrelevant the fact that Roy could not possibly\n\nhave suffered prejudice on any count of conviction by simply labeling counsel\u2019s\n\nabsence a \u201cstructural error\u201d that precludes any examination of how the evidence\n\nrelated to each count.2 Maj. Opn. at 24\u201325. Its circular reasoning is that defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s temporary absence was a Cronic error and all Cronic errors are structural\n\nerrors, therefore the temporary absence was structural error. Maj. Opn. at 17\u201318. I\n\ndo not dispute that Cronic errors are structural errors, or at least akin to them,\n\nbecause they require automatic reversal without any inquiry into the existence of\n\nactual prejudice. See United States v. Arbolaez, 450 F.3d 1283, 1295 (11th Cir.\n\n2006) (explaining that the \u201cconstructive denial of counsel is legally presumed to\n\nresult in prejudice and thus to constitute a structural error\u201d) (quotation marks\n\nomitted). But calling Cronic errors structural errors does not add anything to the\n\nmajority\u2019s analysis. Instead, it simply assumes the conclusion that the temporary\n\nabsence was Cronic error.\n\n\n\n       2\n         The majority asserts that looking into whether there was prejudice as to each count\n\u201cmakes little sense because we would have to speculate about what evidence the jury may have\napplied in its deliberations as to each individual count.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 25. The majority appears\nto disregard the fact that every inquiry into prejudice is inherently speculative, yet courts do it all\nthe time. Cf. Sears v. Upton, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3259, 3266 (2010) (observing that\nStrickland\u2019s prejudice inquiry \u201cwill necessarily require a court to speculate\u201d) (quotation marks\nomitted).\n                                                  60\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 61 of 101\n\n\n      If defense counsel\u2019s temporary absence were a Cronic error, it would\n\nnecessarily follow that it was a structural error, which is a type of error that, by\n\ndefinition, \u201caffect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds\u201d and prevents\n\nthe trial from \u201creliably serv[ing] its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt\n\nor innocence.\u201d Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1265\n\n(1991) (emphasis added). As the facts of this case and the previous discussion\n\nshow, defense counsel\u2019s brief absence did not prevent him from vigorously\n\ndefending Roy, did not affect the entire framework of Roy\u2019s trial, and did not\n\nundermine the reliability of the trial as a mechanism for determining Roy\u2019s guilt or\n\ninnocence. The seven-minute absence during a trial that lasted more than 31 hours\n\nwas not a structural error.\n\n      The majority attempts to bolster its \u201cstructural error\u201d conclusion by asserting\n\nthat structural errors are ones in which a reviewing court can only speculate as to\n\ntheir effect. Maj. Opn. at 22\u201323. That view won\u2019t work because, as the Supreme\n\nCourt has pointed out, any and every inquiry into prejudice is necessarily\n\nspeculative. See Sears, 130 S.Ct. at 3266 (observing that Strickland\u2019s prejudice\n\ninquiry \u201cwill necessarily require a court to speculate\u201d). An error is not transformed\n\ninto structural error simply because in determining whether it had prejudicial effect\n\na reviewing court must engage in speculation. If it were, every error would be\n\nstructural error mandating reversal; there would be no harmless error review.\n\n                                           61\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 62 of 101\n\n\n        Yet the harmless error doctrine is alive and well. And as the Supreme\n\nCourt has repeatedly held, the majority of constitutional errors that occur at a\n\ncriminal trial may be examined for prejudicial effect and do not require reversal if\n\nthey are harmless. In Fulminante, the Court listed a dozen and a half of its\n\ndecisions establishing this point, which refutes the majority\u2019s position:\n\n              Since this Court\u2019s landmark decision in Chapman v. California,\n      386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), in which we\n      adopted the general rule that a constitutional error does not\n      automatically require reversal of a conviction, the Court has applied\n      harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized\n      that most constitutional errors can be harmless. See, e.g., Clemons v.\n      Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738, 752\u2013754, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 1450\u20131451, 108\n      L.Ed.2d 725 (1990) (unconstitutionally overbroad jury instructions at\n      the sentencing stage of a capital case); Satterwhite v.

Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 52\u201353, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1981\u2013\n      1982, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970) (admission of evidence obtained in\n      violation of the Fourth Amendment); Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S.\n      1, 10\u201311, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 2003\u20132004, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970) (denial of\n      counsel at a preliminary hearing in violation of the Sixth Amendment\n      Confrontation Clause).\n\n499 U.S. at 306\u201307, 111 S.Ct. at 1263\u201364. By insisting that a structural error\n\nexists whenever a reviewing court cannot know for certain what effect, if any, the\n\nerror had, the majority expands the category of structural errors to include most or\n\nall errors despite the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reminder that only a \u201cvery limited\n\nclass of errors\u201d qualifies as structural error. United States v. Davila, \u2014 U.S. \u2014,\n\n133 S.Ct. 2139, 2149 (2013).\n\n      The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Fulminante illustrates why defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s brief absence in this case was not a structural error. In that case the\n\nSupreme Court held that the improper admission of a coerced confession was\n\nsubject to harmless error review even though \u201cconfessions have [a] profound\n\n                                          63\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 64 of 101\n\n\nimpact on the jury, so much so that we may justifiably doubt its ability to put them\n\nout of mind even if told to do so.\u201d Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 296, 111 S.Ct. at 1257\n\n(quotation marks omitted). If the erroneous admission of a confession, which may\n\nhave had a \u201cprofound impact on the jury\u201d is not structural error, then neither is the\n\nerroneous admission of inculpatory evidence presented during counsel\u2019s brief\n\nabsence. That is particularly true where that inculpatory evidence is repeated in\n\ncounsel\u2019s presence along with other overwhelming evidence of guilt.\n\n    D. The Majority\u2019s Decision Is an Outlier and the Reasons It Gives for\n                Presuming Prejudice Are Not Persuasive\n\n      In its effort to persuade us that the complete absence of prejudice should not\n\nmatter, the majority puts forward some decisions from our sister circuits. It also\n\ngives several reasons why it believes that Cronic\u2019s presumption of prejudice should\n\napply when defense counsel misses the presentation of any inculpatory evidence,\n\neven a single question and answer. That effort to persuade fails.\n\n                        1. The Decisions of Other Circuits\n\n      Today\u2019s decision makes us the only court of appeals to hold that any\n\nattorney absence during the presentation of any directly inculpatory evidence, even\n\na single question and answer, is \u201cso likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of\n\nlitigating [its] effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658,\n\n104 S.Ct. at 2046. This decision is an outlier that puts us way out there.\n\n\n\n                                           64\n\f              Case: 12-15093        Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 65 of 101\n\n\n       The majority asserts that \u201cno Circuit has applied harmless error review upon\n\na finding that a defendant was deprived of his lawyer during the presentation of\n\ninculpatory testimony to the jury.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 19. That is somewhat misleading\n\nbecause it implies that all circuits have treated attorney absences as Cronic errors,\n\nwhich they have not.3 In United States v. Kaid, for example, the Second Circuit\n\nwas asked to apply Cronic\u2019s presumption to a factual scenario remarkably similar\n\nto the one in this case, and it refused to do so. 502 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2007). In Kaid\n\nseveral codefendants were convicted of conspiring to commit money laundering\n\nand trafficking in contraband cigarettes. Id. at 45. Defense counsel for one of\n\nthose codefendants, Azzeaz Saleh, missed 20 minutes of his client\u2019s trial because\n\nhe misunderstood when the judge planned to continue the trial after a lunch break.\n\nId. at 44\u201345. During defense counsel\u2019s absence, the government presented\n\nevidence that was highly inculpatory of Saleh. The government showed video\n\nfootage of Saleh and other codefendants purchasing the contraband cigarettes that\n\nwere in issue at the trial, and it called a witness to the stand who testified \u201cat nine\n\n\n       3\n          Actually, that is not the only part of that sentence from the majority opinion that is\nwrong. The first clause of the sentence says: \u201cDespite other Circuits\u2019 willingness to apply\nharmless error review to Cronic error generally . . . .\u201d Maj. Opn. at 19. No circuit has been\nwilling to apply harmless error review to a Cronic error, nor should one. As I have explained, if\nthere is Cronic error, no prejudice need be shown. The majority cites Siverson v. O\u2019Leary, 764\nF.2d 1208, 1217\u201319 (7th Cir. 1985), as an example of a decision applying the harmless error rule\nto Cronic error, but the Seventh Circuit did not find Cronic error in that case. Instead, it found\nthat the absence of counsel during jury deliberations, including when the judge questioned the\njury about whether it had reached a verdict, and counsel\u2019s absence during the return of the\nverdict was not Cronic error and was harmless. Id. at 1217\u201321.\n                                               65\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 66 of 101\n\n\nseparate points that the video showed Saleh.\u201d Id. at 45. On appeal Saleh argued\n\nthat he was entitled to a presumption of prejudice because his attorney had been\n\nabsent during a critical stage of the trial, id. at 46, but the Second Circuit\n\nunequivocally rejected that argument and applied Strickland to Saleh\u2019s ineffective\n\nassistance claim. Id. at 46\u201347. The Kaid court affirmed Saleh\u2019s convictions after\n\nconcluding that he had not suffered prejudice from his counsel\u2019s 20-minute\n\nabsence because (1) counsel had been able to challenge the admissibility of the\n\nidentification testimony the day before he was absent from the courtroom, and (2)\n\nafter he returned to the courtroom counsel had been able to cross-examine the\n\nwitness who had repeatedly identified Saleh in the video. Id. at 47. The\n\ncircumstances in our case are even stronger for affirmance than those in Kaid,\n\nbecause there is no indication in the Kaid opinion that the evidence counsel missed\n\nwas repeated after he returned to the courtroom; here, we know it was. The Kaid\n\ndecision is correct, and it is important.\n\n      The majority attempts to distinguish Kaid, by arguing that the Second\n\nCircuit\u2019s decision \u201chas nothing to do with Cronic\u201d because the defendant in Kaid\n\nraised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the court analyzed the claim\n\nin that case under Strickland. See Maj. Opn. at 19. The majority\u2019s argument\n\nignores the fact that Cronic concerned ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and\n\nthat its sole function is to serve as a rare exception to the requirement that a\n\n                                            66\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 67 of 101\n\n\ndefendant show prejudice from an error relating to counsel. See Cronic, 466 U.S.\n\nat 666, 104 S.Ct. at 2051 (concluding that \u201c[t]his case is not one in which the\n\nsurrounding circumstances make it unlikely that the defendant could have received\n\nthe effective assistance of counsel\u201d) (emphasis added). Indeed, the very issue\n\npresented to the Second Circuit by the argument of the petitioner in that case was\n\nwhether Cronic\u2019s presumption of per se prejudice applied, or instead the petitioner\n\nhad to show prejudice. See Kaid, 502 F.3d at 46 (\u201cSaleh argues, however, that the\n\nabove mentioned Strickland requirements, particularly the prejudice prong, are not\n\nnecessary because his counsel\u2019s absence constituted per se ineffective\n\nassistance.\u201d). The petitioner in Kaid argued that Cronic meant he did not have to\n\nshow prejudice. See Brief for Defendant-Appellant Azzeaz Saleh at 9, Kaid, 502\n\nF.3d 43 (No. 05-4470-cr), 2006 WL 5309723 (citing Cronic in support of Saleh\u2019s\n\nargument that he was entitled to a presumption of prejudice). The Second Circuit\n\nrejected Saleh\u2019s Cronic contention and held that he had to show that his attorney\u2019s\n\nabsence from trial prejudiced him. And it held that he failed to do so, even though\n\nhis counsel missed the presentation of twenty minutes of inculpatory testimony (as\n\ncompared to seven minutes in this case). The majority concedes that \u201cthe Second\n\nCircuit worked under Strickland\u2019s framework, not Cronic\u2019s,\u201d Maj. Opn. at 19, but\n\nit fails to recognize what that means, which is that the Second Circuit rejected the\n\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 68 of 101\n\n\nargument that Cronic should apply to a brief absence of counsel from trial during\n\nthe presentation of inculpatory testimony.\n\n      Although the majority cites various decisions from other circuit courts of\n\nappeals in support of its claim that Cronic applies when counsel is absent during\n\nthe presentation of any inculpatory evidence, all of those decisions are\n\ndistinguishable from the present case. The circuits that have applied Cronic\u2019s\n\npresumption to attorney trial absences have done so only when those absences\n\nwere substantial. In Russell, for example, the Fifth Circuit applied Cronic when\n\ncounsel missed two entire days of trial. 205 F.3d at 669\u201371. That case did not\n\ninvolve an absence of only seven minutes of a six-day trial, and it did not involve a\n\nsituation where all of the questions and answers that counsel missed were repeated\n\nafter he returned to the courtroom. The Fifth Circuit also applied Cronic to a\n\nconstructive attorney absence when defense counsel was \u201crepeatedly unconscious\n\nthrough not insubstantial portions of the defendant\u2019s capital murder trial,\u201d having\n\n\u201crepeatedly dozed and/or actually slept during substantial portions of [the] capital\n\nmurder trial.\u201d Burdine, 262 F.3d at 340\u201341. Seven minutes is not a substantial\n\nportion of a six-day trial. And, in any event, there is no indication in the Burdine\n\nopinion that the testimony defense counsel missed while unconscious was repeated\n\nin full after he returned to a state of consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n                                           68\n\f              Case: 12-15093        Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 69 of 101\n\n\n       The Sixth Circuit applied the Cronic presumption in a case where defense\n\ncounsel missed at least 100 minutes of trial. 4 See Green v. Arn, 809 F.2d 1257,\n\n1260\u201361 (6th Cir. 1987), vacated on other grounds, 484 U.S. 806, 108 S.Ct. 52\n\n(1987), reinstated, 839 F.2d 300 (1988). But a hundred minutes is not seven\n\nminutes, and the Green court acknowledged that \u201csome absences by a criminal\n\n\n       4\n          Although the majority points out that there may be some ambiguity in the Green\nopinion concerning the length of defense counsel\u2019s absence, see Majority Opn. at 14 n.2,\nportions of the transcript quoted in the Green decision indicate that the absence was not brief.\nSee Green, 809 F.2d at 1260\u201361 (noting that defense counsel for Green\u2019s codefendants had\nbegun cross-examining a witness at 2 pm and by 3:40 pm the defendant\u2019s trial counsel still had\nnot returned to the courtroom). The majority also fails to acknowledge that Green alleged that\nher attorney had been absent during other portions of the criminal proceedings against her,\nincluding an entire hearing on a suppression motion, the government\u2019s closing arguments at trial,\nand when the jury asked the court questions during its deliberations. Id. at 1259 n.1. Nothing\nlike that happened in this case.\n        Even though defense counsel in Green missed far more of the trial than Roy\u2019s counsel\nmissed in this case, the decision to presume prejudice was ardently attacked by a dissenting\njudge in that case. Judge Boggs recognized that the majority\u2019s decision in Green went well\nbeyond Cronic, created perverse incentives for defense attorneys, and unduly burdened trial\njudges. He noted that Cronic applied where there was a \u201ccomplete denial of counsel\u201d at a critical\nstage, and that a presumption of prejudice was warranted only when there was a denial of\ncounsel that was \u201ccomplete in terms of the process of truth-seeking.\u201d Id. at 1264 (Boggs, J.,\ndissenting) (quotation marks omitted). He argued that there was no complete denial of counsel\nin Green because of \u201cthe episodic nature of the absence.\u201d Id. at 1265.\n       The majority argues that \u201cJudge Boggs, the dissenter in Green, would seem to join the\nmajority in this case.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 26. That is a mistaken view of his position, as this excerpt\nfrom his dissenting opinion in that case makes clear:\n       Here, there is no hint or even speculation that what went into the record or into\n       the ears of the jury would have differed if the error had not occurred. Nor is this\n       an instance where counsel\u2019s presence to object or take a strategic decision could\n       have been crucial, nor where an opportunity was irrevocably waived. It elevates\n       form over substance to equate what occurred here to the true denials of counsel\n       cited in Cronic.\nGreen, 809 F.2d at 1265 (Boggs, J. dissenting). Exactly the same is true in this case where the\nmajority has elevated form over substance to reverse convictions based on a false analogy to the\ndenial of counsel during an entire stage of a criminal prosecution, the situation to which Cronic\napplies.\n                                                69\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 70 of 101\n\n\ndefendant\u2019s attorney might be so de minimis that there would be no constitutional\n\nsignificance.\u201d Id. at 1261. The counsel in that case missed cross-examining an\n\nimportant prosecution witness because he had left the trial to attend to other\n\nbusiness. Id. at 1259\u201360. That did not happen in the present case where counsel\n\ncross-examined the witness and did so for 45 pages of the trial transcript. Instead\n\nof being \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to this case, as the majority believes, the facts in\n\nGreen are clearly distinguishable. In another case the Sixth Circuit again applied a\n\npresumption of prejudice where defense counsel \u201cwas absent on numerous\n\noccasions during trial,\u201d including for the entire testimony of two witnesses against\n\nhim and the presentation of incriminating wiretap evidence. Olden v. United\n\nStates, 224 F.3d 561, 568\u201369 (6th Cir. 2000). That did not happen here.\n\n      In United States v. Patterson, 215 F.3d 776, 783, 785\u201386 (7th Cir. 2000),\n\nvacated in part on other grounds, 531 U.S. 1033, 121 S.Ct. 621 (2000), the Seventh\n\nCircuit held that an inquiry into prejudice was unnecessary when defense counsel\n\nmissed a lot of the trial. And I mean a lot. He \u201cmissed seven days of [a police\n\nofficer\u2019s] testimony, four of five sessions of the jury instruction conference, most\n\nof the other defendants\u2019 closing arguments, and proceedings to address notes from\n\nthe jury during deliberations.\u201d Id. at 783. Seven days is not seven minutes.\n\n      The attorney absences in all of the decisions from other circuits that the\n\nmajority relies on were lengthy \u2013\u2013 far longer than in this case. In addition, the trial\n\n                                           70\n\f              Case: 12-15093        Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 71 of 101\n\n\ncourt was aware of defense counsel\u2019s absence in almost every one of those cases. 5\n\nAnd in none of those cases was the testimony that counsel had missed repeated\n\nafter he returned to the courtroom, as it was here. While it may be said that the\n\nabsences of counsel in the cases cited by the majority were so substantial and \u201cso\n\nlikely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect [was]\n\nunjustified,\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046, the same cannot be said of\n\nthe brief absence in this case. The closest case to the facts of this one is Kaid,\n\nwhere the Second Circuit refused to presume prejudice and affirmed the\n\nconvictions. Today\u2019s decision stands alone as the most extreme application of\n\nCronic. It has no peers.\n\n  2. Temporary Attorney Absences Are Not Always Prejudicial and Courts\n              Can Determine Whether Prejudice Occurred\n\n       In support of its position, the majority engages in a lengthy discussion to\n\nestablish that Cronic error and structural error are not subject to harmless error\n\nreview. See Maj. Opn. at 17\u201320. Everyone knows that. That is not the issue. The\n\nissue is whether a brief attorney absence during the presentation of any inculpatory\n\nevidence at all is always Cronic error no matter what. If it is a Cronic error, then it\n\nis a structural error and not subject to review for harmlessness. If it is not a Cronic\n\n       5\n          The only clear exception is that the trial court in Burdine was unaware that defense\ncounsel was sleeping. Burdine, 262 F.3d at 389 (Barksdale, J., dissenting). The Patterson\ndecision does not indicate whether the trial court was aware of the defense attorney\u2019s absence in\nthat case.\n\n\n                                               71\n\f             Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 72 of 101\n\n\nerror, then we review for harmlessness if the error was properly preserved at trial\n\nor only for plain error if it was not.\n\n      The majority asserts that whenever an attorney is not present during any part\n\nof the presentation of inculpatory evidence, no matter how small the part he\n\nmissed, we should find Cronic error and presume prejudice because determining\n\nwhether there actually was prejudice would be \u201can exacting and problematic\n\nundertaking\u201d and a court can never \u201caccurately determine whether and to what\n\nextent counsel\u2019s absence prejudiced\u201d a defendant. Maj. Opn. at 20. The majority\n\nrelies on a law review article for its belief about that instead of on relevant\n\ndecisions that provide sounder guidance. See, e.g., United States v. Osterbrock,\n\n891 F.2d 1216, 1218 (6th Cir. 1989) (applying harmless error review to attorney\u2019s\n\ntrial absence when jury verdict was returned); Siverson v.

Calabro, 467 F.2d\n\n973, 988\u201389 (2d Cir. 1972) (same).\n\n      Many state appellate courts have concluded that courts are capable of\n\ndetermining whether the temporary absence of an attorney prejudiced a defendant.\n\nSee Jackson v. State, 983 So. 2d 562, 574\u201377 (Fla. 2008) (applying harmless error\n\nanalysis to trial court\u2019s decision to hear testimony from the victim for purposes of\n\nsentencing the defendant while defense counsel was absent); Wilson v.

Scherzer, 694 A.2d 196, 237\u201340 (N.J. Super. Ct.\n\nApp. Div. 1997) (applying harmless error analysis where defense counsel was\n\nabsent \u201cfrom many pretrial proceedings; a portion of jury voir dire; several days of\n\ntestimony during trial, including the entire testimony of the State\u2019s expert\n\nwitness . . . ; parts of [the] codefendants\u2019 and the prosecutor\u2019s summations; a\n\nportion of the charge conference; some of the jury\u2019s questions during deliberations;\n\nand also the reading of the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d); Hodges v. State, 116 S.W.3d 289, 292\u2013\n\n94 (Tex. App. 2003) (applying harmless error analysis to defense counsel\u2019s\n\nabsence during presentation of adverse testimony from a detective during the\n\npenalty phase of a case). In the Hodges decision, the Texas Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals stated that it agreed with our decision in Vines that a temporary absence\n\nof counsel during part of the trial does not necessarily infect the entire trial and\n\npreclude application of the harmless error doctrine. Hodges, 164 S.W.3d at 294\n\nn.7.\n\n       In our decision in Vines, we specifically held that:\n\n       [T]he temporary absence of a defendant\u2019s trial counsel during a\n       portion of the actual trial does not necessarily affect the conduct of the\n       entire trial. While trial counsel may exercise poor judgment in\n       absenting himself or herself from a portion of a trial, such flawed\n       judgment does not necessarily infect the entire trial.\n\n                                           73\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 74 of 101\n\n\n28 F.3d at 1129 (emphasis omitted). We determined in Vines that harmless error\n\nanalysis was appropriate after concluding that the attorney absence in that case was\n\nneither Cronic error nor structural error, but instead a \u201ctrial error.\u201d Id. at 1128\u201329.\n\nLike the attorney\u2019s absence in Vines, the attorney\u2019s brief absence in this case does\n\nnot qualify as Cronic error or structural error because, as explained in Part II.C\n\nabove, it did not render Roy\u2019s entire trial unreliable. See id. at 1129 (explaining\n\nthat structural defects, such as \u201cthe total deprivation of counsel,\u201d \u201cnecessarily\n\naffect the conduct of the entire trial\u201d and involve errors so egregious that \u201cin their\n\nabsence no criminal trial can be deemed reliable\u201d).\n\n      Although our conclusion in Vines that the Cronic presumption of prejudice\n\ndid not apply came after we had found that the evidence introduced during\n\ncounsel\u2019s absence was not directly inculpatory, see Vines, 28 F.3d at 1128, we did\n\nnot hold that the Cronic presumption applies whenever any inculpatory evidence is\n\npresented during counsel\u2019s absence. We could not have held that in Vines because\n\nthose were not the facts before us in that case. See Watts v. BellSouth\n\nTelecomms., Inc., 316 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir. 2003) (\u201c[J]udicial decisions\n\ncannot make law beyond the facts of the cases in which those decisions are\n\nannounced.\u201d); see also Anders v. Hometown Mortg. Servs., Inc., 346 F.3d 1024,\n\n1031 (11th Cir. 2003). We have never held that prejudice is conclusively\n\n\n\n\n                                          74\n\f             Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 75 of 101\n\n\npresumed if any inculpatory evidence at all is taken in counsel\u2019s absence, and we\n\nshould not be holding that today.\n\n      Any error involving the seven-minute absence of Roy\u2019s counsel during the\n\ntestimony of one of thirteen government witnesses during a six-day trial, where the\n\nsame evidence also came in during testimony the witness gave after counsel\n\nreturned, is at most a \u201ctrial error.\u201d As we explained in Vines:\n\n      A trial error is an error which occurs during the presentation of a case\n      to a jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed . . . in\n      order to determine whether [it] was harmless.\n\n28 F.3d at 1129 (quotation marks and brackets omitted). Again, the record in this\n\ncase is such that we can assess the testimony that occurred in the seven-minute\n\nabsence of Roy\u2019s counsel to determine whether that absence was harmless. See\n\nsupra Part II.C.\n\n      Despite these controlling principles, the majority insists that prejudice must\n\nbe presumed because the absence of counsel during the presentation of inculpatory\n\nevidence \u201celiminates the opportunity to decide whether to lodge an objection and\n\nhow to frame the objection.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 13. That assertion, as well as the\n\nmajority\u2019s claim that Roy\u2019s attorney \u201ccould not have known\u201d what evidence he\n\nmissed, Maj. Opn. at 21, is simply not correct. A defense attorney who misses any\n\nmoment of the direct examination of a government witness could, upon returning\n\nto the courtroom, ask that the transcript be read back outside the presence of the\n\n                                         75\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 76 of 101\n\n\njury and request that any objectionable testimony be stricken from the record. And\n\nonce that testimony has been read back to defense counsel, he would have full\n\nknowledge of the witness\u2019 statements, which he could then challenge on cross-\n\nexamination.\n\n      In this case, as far as we know, Roy\u2019s attorney did not ask for an opportunity\n\nto review the portion of Deputy Longson\u2019s testimony that he had missed. But we\n\ndo know that there was no lost-objection prejudice from his seven-minute absence\n\nbecause no exhibits were admitted during that time, and when the same testimony\n\nwas presented immediately after counsel returned, he did not object to any of it.\n\nThere is no valid objection that he could have made had he been there the seven\n\nminutes he was absent (Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has not suggested one), and\n\ncounsel was able to vigorously cross-examine Longson about his testimony after\n\nhe returned to the courtroom.\n\n      The defect in the majority\u2019s reasoning is also apparent from the fact that\n\ncourts regularly analyze whether an attorney\u2019s failure to object resulted in\n\nprejudice. See, e.g., Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 366, 113 S.Ct. 838, 841\n\n(1993) (determining whether petitioner was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to\n\nmake an objection in a state criminal sentencing proceeding\u201d in a capital case);\n\nGordon v. United States, 518 F.3d 1291, 1299\u20131301 (11th Cir. 2008) (determining\n\nwhether trial \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to object to an absence of inquiry about the right to\n\n                                          76\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 77 of 101\n\n\nallocute\u201d prejudiced the habeas petitioner); Purvis v. Crosby, 451 F.3d 734, 738\n\n(11th Cir. 2006) (determining whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the\n\nclosure of the courtroom during a young victim\u2019s testimony in a child molestation\n\ntrial prejudiced the habeas petitioner); Sims v. Singletary, 155 F.3d 1297, 1309\n\n(11th Cir. 1998) (noting that \u201cassuming arguendo that counsel\u2019s failure to object to\n\nthe prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted ineffective assistance, [the petitioner] has\n\nshown no prejudice as a result of this inaction\u201d). Although the majority contends\n\nthat the prejudice inquiry is an \u201cexacting and problematic undertaking,\u201d there is\n\nnothing unusual or unusually difficult about determining whether a failure to object\n\nwas prejudicial. Courts do it all the time. The majority\u2019s position that we cannot\n\nor should not determine whether a failure to object was prejudicial is contrary to\n\nbinding precedent and our regular practice.\n\n      The majority also asserts that counsel\u2019s absence during the presentation of\n\nany inculpatory testimony \u201celiminates . . . the ability to conduct cross-\n\nexamination.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 13. Not necessarily, and not in this case. As I\n\nmentioned earlier, once counsel returns to the courtroom he can ask to have the\n\ntranscript read back to him outside the presence of the jury. That would provide\n\nhim with full knowledge of the witness\u2019 statements, which he could then challenge\n\non cross-examination. And as this case illustrates, that approach may not even be\n\nnecessary where the witness repeats all of his testimony after defense counsel\n\n                                          77\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 78 of 101\n\n\nreturns to the courtroom. It is obvious in this case that defense counsel\u2019s absence\n\nfor seven minutes of Longson\u2019s testimony did not eliminate his ability to cross-\n\nexamine that witness. The record shows that the testimony Deputy Longson gave\n\nduring counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence was repeated immediately after he\n\nreturned, and counsel vigorously cross-examined Longson about it.\n\n      And even if defense counsel\u2019s ability to cross-examine Longson had been\n\nimpeded, the majority\u2019s reasoning is flawed because it assumes that any gap or\n\nshortcoming in cross-examination cannot be examined for its prejudicial effect.\n\nAlthough the majority may believe that it is \u201can exacting and problematic\u201d task to\n\ndo so, courts regularly inquire into whether an attorney\u2019s failure to cross-examine a\n\nwitness in a particular way or to use a particular strategy or tactic in cross-\n\nexamination prejudiced the defendant. See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263,\n\n289\u201395, 296, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1952\u201355 (1999) (determining whether petitioner had\n\nshown prejudice from being deprived of any opportunity to use certain withheld\n\ndocuments to impeach a key prosecution witness, and finding that he had); Fugate\n\nv. Head, 261 F.3d 1206, 1220 (11th Cir. 2001) (determining whether petitioner had\n\nshown prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination to impeach the\n\nsole eyewitness to the murder with his prior inconsistent statement to the police,\n\nand finding that he had not); id. at 1220\u201321 (determining whether petitioner had\n\nshown prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination of the medical\n\n                                           78\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 79 of 101\n\n\nexaminer to impeach him with inconsistencies between his autopsy report and his\n\ntestimony, and finding that he had not); Nixon v. Newsome, 888 F.2d 112, 116\n\n(11th Cir. 1989) (determining whether petitioner had shown prejudice from his\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination to impeach the key prosecution witness\n\nwith her prior inconsistent testimony, and finding that he had); Smith v.\n\nWainwright, 799 F.2d 1442, 1444 (11th Cir. 1986) (determining whether petitioner\n\nhad shown prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure during cross-examination to\n\nimpeach the two prosecution witnesses with their prior inconsistent statements, and\n\nfinding that he had not). All of those decisions and others show that courts can,\n\nand regularly do, determine whether a failure to cross-examine a witness about a\n\nparticular fact or in a particular way was prejudicial. There is nothing unusual or\n\nespecially difficult about doing that. If there were, we would not do it routinely.\n\nYet we do. We could and should do it in this case.\n\n      The majority also theorizes that prejudice must be presumed from defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s brief absence because \u201ca defendant may irretrievably lose available\n\ndefenses and rights during direct testimony of a prosecution witness.\u201d Maj. Opn.\n\nat 13. The first problem with that theory is that it confuses presentation of the\n\ngovernment\u2019s case at trial with arraignment. The only authorities that the majority\n\ncites for its proposition are two decisions that involved a defense attorney\u2019s\n\nabsence from arraignment. See Hamilton, 368 U.S. at 54, 82 S.Ct. at 159; White,\n\n                                          79\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 80 of 101\n\n\n373 U.S. at 60, 83 S.Ct. at 1051. There is a difference between arraignment, where\n\ncertain defenses must be asserted or lost, and the direct examination of a\n\nprosecution witness during the middle of a trial, where the defendant is not\n\nrequired to assert defenses.\n\n      The second problem with the majority\u2019s lost-defenses theory is that, even if\n\na defense is somehow lost by defense counsel missing a few minutes of a direct\n\nexamination, courts regularly inquire into whether a defense attorney\u2019s failure to\n\nraise a defense at trial prejudiced the defendant. See Roberts v. Comm\u2019r, Ala.\n\nDep\u2019t of Corr., 677 F.3d 1086, 1090\u201393 (11th Cir. 2012) (insanity defense); Pietri\n\nv. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 641 F.3d 1276, 1280\u201384 (11th Cir. 2011) (voluntary\n\nintoxication defense); West v. United States, 631 F.3d 563, 567\u201368 (1st Cir. 2011)\n\n(entrapment defense); Currier v. United States, 320 F.3d 52, 56\u201357 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(necessity defense). We did just that, just last year, when we held that an\n\nattorney\u2019s failure to assert a voluntary intoxication defense on behalf of a capital\n\ndefendant was not prejudicial. See Reaves v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 717 F.3d\n\n886, 900\u201305 (11th Cir. 2013). The majority, presumably, would have decided the\n\n\u201clost defenses\u201d cases differently than this Court did in Roberts, Pietri, and Reaves\n\nbecause it believes that looking into prejudice is an \u201cexacting and problematic\u201d\n\nendeavor. But binding precedent is binding precedent, and the majority\u2019s position\n\nthat a prejudice inquiry is impossible, or at least should not be permitted, on a lost-\n\n                                          80\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 81 of 101\n\n\ndefense claim is contrary to all of that binding precedent. In any event, neither the\n\nmajority nor Roy\u2019s appellate counsel has been able to point to any conceivable\n\ndefenses that were lost by defense counsel\u2019s seven-minute absence in this case.\n\n      Although the majority does not argue this, a defense counsel\u2019s temporary\n\nabsence might also be prejudicial if it results in the failure to present evidence\n\ncountering the testimony of an adverse witness. But that possibility does not\n\nrequire a presumption of prejudice because courts regularly determine whether an\n\nattorney\u2019s failure to present evidence prejudiced the defendant. See, e.g., Hinton v.\n\nAlabama, \u2013\u2013 U.S. \u2013\u2013, 134 S.Ct. 1081, 1089\u201390 (2014) (vacating and remanding to\n\nallow the district court to determine whether petitioner was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to request additional funding in order to hire an adequate expert);\n\nHarrington v. Richter, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 770, 791\u201392 (2011) (determining\n\nwhether petitioner was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to present expert testimony\n\non serology, pathology, and blood spatter patterns); Jackson v. Herring, 42 F.3d\n\n1350, 1362, 1368\u201369 (11th Cir. 1995) (determining whether petitioner was\n\nprejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence at\n\nsentencing). This kind of prejudice inquiry is old hat for courts. We do it often,\n\nwithout any suggestion that it is impossible or too much trouble. It is part of our\n\njudicial duties.\n\n\n\n\n                                          81\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 82 of 101\n\n\n      Despite all of this long-standing precedent, the majority insists that we must\n\npresume prejudice because \u201c[i]t would be difficult, if not impossible, for us as a\n\nreviewing court to discern, on a cold record, the reaction of the jury to the evidence\n\npresented and, therefore, to what extent counsel may have been able to react in a\n\nmanner that would improve his client\u2019s likelihood of acquittal.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 20.\n\nReally? Does this mean that in order to be effective an attorney must constantly\n\nmonitor the jurors\u2019 faces for reactions to the testimony? Does it mean that if\n\ndefense counsel focuses on the witness or is reading his notes during the testimony,\n\nprejudice must be presumed from his failure to watch \u201cthe reaction of the jury to\n\nthe evidence\u201d? In any event, the majority\u2019s assertion, which is supported only by\n\ncitation to a Nebraska Law Review article, goes against all of the binding\n\nprecedent cited in this section, in addition to all of our case law dealing with claims\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel, which illustrates that courts regularly rely on a\n\n\u201ccold record\u201d to determine whether prejudice actually occurred.\n\n    III. The Majority\u2019s Holding Will Have Far Reaching Adverse Effects\n\n        Under the majority\u2019s holding and reasoning, if defense counsel misses\n\neven a single inculpatory question and answer, courts in this circuit must\n\nconclusively presume prejudice and set aside any conviction no matter how clearly\n\nand irrefutably the record establishes that there was no prejudice. Even when a\n\ncourt is firmly convinced there is no prejudice. No exceptions. It does not matter\n\n                                          82\n\f             Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 83 of 101\n\n\nwhat the facts are, it does not matter how overwhelming the other evidence of guilt\n\nis, it does not matter if no reasonable person could believe that counsel\u2019s\n\nmomentary absence made any difference at all. Prejudice is not required because it\n\nis conclusively presumed, which in this instance means that we must pretend that\n\nsomething exists even if we know that it does not. Nothing else will ever matter\n\nbut the majority\u2019s ironclad rule that nothing else matters. And the majority\u2019s rule\n\nhas a wide kill zone. Not only must the conviction on the count that the missed\n\ntestimony concerns be extinguished, but every conviction on every count in the\n\nindictment must be as well. No exceptions.\n\n        The majority makes a futile attempt to persuade us that maybe \u2014 just\n\nmaybe \u2014 its all-encompassing rule might not encompass all inculpatory testimony\n\nafter all. It points out that counsel\u2019s absence came during not just the testimony of\n\nany old witness for the prosecution but during the testimony of the deputy sheriff\n\nwho was the government\u2019s specialist expert witness. See Maj. Opn. at 26. But so\n\nwhat? For purposes of the pretend prejudice rule what principled basis is there for\n\ndistinguishing one category or type of prosecution witness from another? Suppose\n\nthe deputy sheriff had not been testifying as an expert witness in the field of\n\ncomputer forensics but for some other reason. Would that have mattered; if so,\n\nwhy? Or suppose the government\u2019s computer expert witness had not been a\n\ndeputy but instead had been an outside expert hired on a contract basis. Would\n\n                                          83\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 84 of 101\n\n\nthat have mattered; if so, why? Or suppose the witness testifying while counsel\n\nwas out had been a non-law enforcement, non-expert witness who nonetheless\n\ngave incriminating testimony against Roy. Would that have mattered; if so, why?\n\nThe point is that all, or virtually all, government witnesses give inculpatory\n\ntestimony against the defendant, which is why they are government witnesses.\n\nThere is no principled basis for distinguishing one from another. The majority\u2019s\n\nabsolute, all-encompassing pretend prejudice rule either encompasses all witnesses\n\nwho give any inculpatory testimony or it encompasses none. It ought to be none.\n\n        The majority opinion and its ironclad, pretend-prejudice rule will as a\n\npractical matter require district judges to closely monitor their courtrooms to\n\nensure that each attorney arrives on time in the morning, returns promptly after\n\nevery break, is at the bench during each discussion there, and doesn\u2019t step out of\n\nthe courtroom for even a moment while testimony is being taken. Judges, like\n\nkindergarten teachers, will be forced to keep an eye on their lawyer-children at all\n\ntimes to prevent one from toddling away without being noticed. How this is to be\n\ndone, given everything else that is going on in a trial and competing for the judge\u2019s\n\nattention, the majority does not say. Maybe the requirement of perfect attendance\n\nduring every minute of the trial can be achieved by forcing each lawyer to wear an\n\nankle bracelet rigged to set off an alarm when he strays out of range from counsel\n\ntable. That might do the trick. Given all of the important duties a judge has during\n\n                                          84\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 85 of 101\n\n\na trial, the majority creates a misguided rule that now requires a judge to keep an\n\neye on all of the attorneys at all times throughout a trial, under pain of automatic\n\nreversal if one attorney momentarily steps away unnoticed.\n\n        There also is no reason why this \u201cRoy rule\u201d won\u2019t apply to situations\n\nwhere defense counsel\u2019s constructive or actual absence is likely to go unnoticed by\n\nthe prosecution and the judge, such as where defense counsel dozes during trial or\n\nin a large multi-defendant trial where counsel is actually absent. There is no\n\nprincipled basis not to apply the rule of today\u2019s decision to those two situations as\n\nwell. Why would the risk of prejudice, or the justification for pretending that there\n\nwas prejudice, be any less if Roy\u2019s counsel had dozed off during those seven\n\nminutes and, instead of being physically away from the courtroom, was away in\n\ndreamland? Either way the attorney would not be conscious of what was being\n\nsaid. All an attorney now has to do to get his client an automatic reversal of any\n\nconviction is file an affidavit stating that he had inadvertently dozed off during two\n\nor three minutes while a government witness was testifying against his client and\n\nfor that reason missed some of the testimony. Remember that under the majority\u2019s\n\nrule once an attorney\u2019s absence, in this hypothetical a mental absence, is shown,\n\nprejudice must be conclusively presumed and all of the defendant\u2019s convictions\n\noverturned. No questions may be asked of counsel. So trial judges will have the\n\nduty not only to ensure that every defendant\u2019s attorney is physically present during\n\n                                          85\n\f               Case: 12-15093      Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 86 of 101\n\n\nevery minute of the trial but also that every attorney is wide awake and alert at all\n\ntimes. The prudent judge may want to have each counsel table stocked with\n\ncaffeine tablets and energy drinks.6\n\n           Whatever measures a judge takes in response to today\u2019s ruling, it will be\n\npractically impossible to prevent presumptive prejudice error in a large, multi-\n\ndefendant, long-running trial. See Green, 809 F.2d at 1265 (Boggs, J. dissenting)\n\n(\u201cIf a reversal is mandated whenever counsel (even retained) is absent from the\n\ncourtroom for any significant period, we make such an escape a sure ticket to a\n\nnew trial. In multi-defendant cases, judges will be required to keep a continual\n\nhead count . . . lest cagey counsel be able to invoke this new rule.\u201d). After the\n\njudge, jury, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and others have spent months in a\n\ncomplex trial and verdicts of conviction have been returned, none of it will mean\n\nanything for any defendant whose attorney can show that he was absent or dozed\n\noff during any of the testimony from any of the many witnesses against his client.\n\nThat will be true even if the attorney missed only a few of the thousands of\n\nquestions and answers that directly or indirectly inculpated his client during the\n\n\n\n       6\n          Judges might also consider converting their bailiffs into something akin to Puritan\nTithingmen. Those \u201cancient watchm[e]n of the congregation\u201d had among their duties\n\u201cdisturb[ing] the slumbers of age\u201d and seeing to it \u201cthat all persons were attentive\u201d throughout\nseemingly interminable sermons. They carried a wooden rod tipped at one end with a squirrel\u2019s\ntail used to awaken female congregants who dozed off. At the other end was a brass tip, or in\nsome cases a deer\u2019s hoof, \u201cwhich carried sharp conviction to men and boys\u201d who dared doze.\nHerbert B. Adams, Saxon Tithingmen in America 1 & n.1 (1883).\n                                               86\n\f              Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 87 of 101\n\n\nlong trial. It will not matter, as the majority insists it does not matter in this case,\n\nwhether the inculpatory testimony that the attorney missed was repeated in his\n\n(conscious) presence. And it will not matter in the least why the attorney was\n\nabsent or whether the judge noticed the absence. That is the rule the majority\n\nadopts.\n\n          The majority suggests that its no-exceptions, pretend-prejudice rule is\n\nparticularly warranted in this case because there was only a single defendant and a\n\nsingle defense attorney for the court to monitor. See Maj. Opn. at 2, 28. But the\n\nrationale for the Cronic rule, and the majority\u2019s reason for applying it and\n\npresuming prejudice in this case, has nothing to do with the number of defendants\n\nor defense attorneys in a particular case. The Cronic opinion does not talk about\n\nthe ease of preventing an error but instead about the great likelihood of prejudice\n\nfrom certain errors, such as the total deprivation of counsel from an entire stage of\n\nthe trial. See 466 U.S. at 658\u201360, 104 S.Ct. at 2046\u201347. Why would the risk of\n\nprejudice, or the justification for presuming it, be any less if Roy had been tried\n\nwith eight or ten codefendants and the same inculpatory evidence had been\n\npresented while his attorney was absent? There is no logical reason why the\n\nlikelihood that an attorney absence is overlooked, or the difficulty in guarding\n\nagainst an absence and ensuring perfect attendance and perfect attention, would\n\nchange the prejudicial effect of an absence. If the prejudicial effect of a seven-\n\n                                            87\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 88 of 101\n\n\nminute absence must be conclusively presumed in this case involving a six-day\n\ntrial with one defendant, it must also be conclusively presumed when there is a\n\nseven-minute absence during a six-month trial with a dozen defendants. The\n\npresumption of prejudice that the majority has written into our circuit law logically\n\nmust apply in all trials or in none. It should be none.\n\n      The majority\u2019s rule permits no inquiry into the reason or motivation behind\n\nthe absence, as its refusal to permit a remand for an evidentiary inquiry in this case\n\ndemonstrates. Even if a defense attorney deliberately steps out of the courtroom\n\nfor a minute or two for the purpose of putting in his pocket a get-out-of-jail-free\n\ncard for his client, he still gets to play that card. His absence trumps his client\u2019s\n\nconviction, which must be set aside, and no further questions may be asked\n\nbecause nothing else matters. We must always pretend that prejudice exists.\n\nAbsence, whatever the reason or motive, equals reversal.\n\n        The majority tells us not to worry about an attorney deliberately missing a\n\nfew minutes of testimony to guarantee that any conviction of his client will be set\n\naside. See Maj. Opn. at 27. It could not possibly be a problem, we are told,\n\nbecause lawyers are \u201cofficers of the Court bound by rules of professional\n\nresponsibility.\u201d Maj. Opn. at 27. The majority believes that the threat of\n\ndisciplinary proceedings will prevent defense attorneys from taking advantage of\n\n\n\n\n                                           88\n\f                Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014       Page: 89 of 101\n\n\ntoday\u2019s holding. That is not true, but \u201c[i]sn\u2019t it pretty to think so?\u201d7 If lawyers\n\nwere angels, the majority\u2019s belief that all lawyers are always ethical would make\n\nsense, but if they were angels we would not need ethical rules and disciplinary\n\nbodies. Lawyers are people and like all people they have flaws and failings and\n\nsometimes behave improperly and unethically. The majority\u2019s contrary theory\n\ndoes not fit the world in which we live.\n\n            And the facts belie the majority\u2019s theory. Lawyers practicing in our circuit\n\nare regularly disciplined and even prosecuted for violating their ethical duties and\n\nthe law. The Florida Supreme Court enters hundreds of orders each year\n\ndisciplining attorneys for unethical conduct. 8 The Georgia Supreme Court enters\n\nmore than a hundred each year, 9 and the Alabama Supreme Court is not far\n\nbehind.10 In all, there were more than 600 disciplinary orders entered against\n\nlawyers in the three states of our circuit during 2011, the last published reporting\n\n\n\n       7\n           Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises 247 (Macmillan Publ\u2019g Co. 1987) (1926).\n       8\n         Florida attorneys were publically disciplined in 380 instances in 2011, 380 instances in\n2012, and 233 instances in 2013. See Standing Comm. on Prof\u2019l Discipline, ABA Ctr. for Prof\u2019l\nResponsibility, 2011 Survey on Lawyer Discipline Systems (S.O.L.D.) (2013). The ABA has\nnot yet published its S.O.L.D. reports for 2012 and 2013, and the figures for those years come\nfrom preliminary data submitted to the ABA by Florida\u2019s disciplinary agency.\n       9\n         Georgia lawyers were disciplined in 177 instances in 2011, 149 instances in 2012, and\n120 instances in 2013. See ABA, supra. Like the 2012 and 2013 statistics for Florida, Georgia\u2019s\nfigures for those two years come from preliminary data collected by the ABA.\n       10\n        Alabama lawyers were sanctioned in 82 instances in 2011. See ABA, supra.\nAlabama\u2019s figures for 2012 and 2013 have not yet been reported to the ABA.\n\n\n                                               89\n\f               Case: 12-15093   Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 90 of 101\n\n\nyear. 11 And those are counting only the cases where lawyers were caught and\n\nformally disciplined.\n\n           The temptation to game the system and take advantage of the guaranteed\n\nreversal that the Roy rule creates will be especially great in capital cases. Many\n\nattorneys who represent capital defendants sincerely believe that the death penalty\n\nis not only bad policy but is also immoral. They can literally save their client\u2019s\n\nlife, or at least delay his death, by strategically slipping out of the courtroom for a\n\nfew minutes, or returning to it a little late, while the prosecution\u2019s case against him\n\nis being presented. And what about counsel representing a defendant who is a\n\nmember of a violent gang? His client may insist that counsel game the system with\n\na brief absence so that any conviction can be overturned under \u201cthe Roy rule.\u201d The\n\nclient\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d may be one that counsel finds difficult to refuse.\n\n      The majority is confident that lawyers won\u2019t place their licenses in jeopardy\n\nby strategically taking advantage of today\u2019s holding. That confidence is especially\n\nunwarranted because there is so little chance that an attorney who does take\n\nadvantage of the \u201cRoy rule\u201d would ever suffer any consequences. If a trial judge\n\nnotices defense counsel leaving the courtroom in the middle of trial, the penalty for\n\nthat act is relatively small. See United States v. Fakhoury, 819 F.2d 1415, 1424\n\n\n\n      11\n           See supra nn.8\u201310.\n\n\n                                           90\n\f              Case: 12-15093    Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 91 of 101\n\n\n(7th Cir. 1987) (\u201c[T]rial counsel was reprimanded by the district judge for leaving\n\nthe courtroom when the government was presenting its case . . . .\u201d). If the trial\n\njudge does not notice defense counsel\u2019s brief absence and the issue is raised for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, counsel can avoid ever having to account for his absence by\n\nhaving a new attorney represent the defendant on appeal. Recall that in this case\n\ntrial counsel has never been held to account for his absence or even asked about it.\n\nThe majority sees no reason for inquiring into the absence because all that matters\n\nto the majority is the fact that it occurred, not the reason it occurred. And even if\n\nthere were an inquiry, how would one ever prove that the reason an attorney was\n\nout of the courtroom was his subjective intent to ensure a reversal of any\n\nconviction?\n\n      And what about a \u201cconstructive\u201d absence? If a defense attorney decides on\n\nthe 15th day of a trial that the proceeding is not going well for his client, what is to\n\nstop him from closing his eyes for a minute or two during the examination of a\n\ngovernment witness, approaching the judge to claim that he was \u201csleeping\u201d when\n\nhis eyes were closed, and then asserting that his client is entitled to a mistrial\n\nbecause he was constructively absent during the presentation of inculpatory\n\nevidence? How could the court know whether the attorney had in fact been\n\nasleep?\n\n\n\n\n                                           91\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 92 of 101\n\n\n        For all of these reasons, the majority\u2019s reasoning is unpersuasive and the\n\n\u201cvery narrow\u201d presumed prejudice rule of Cronic should not be applied in this\n\ncase. See Stano, 921 F.2d at 1153 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n                      IV. How We Should Decide This Case\n\n      Because any error involved in counsel\u2019s momentary absence from the\n\ncourtroom was not Cronic error, it was at most trial error and trial errors are\n\nsubject to the normal rules of review. See Vines, 28 F.3d at 1128\u201329.\n\n A. The Contemporaneous Objection Rule Furthers Important Interests of\n Our Criminal Justice System and Should Apply to Brief Attorney Absences\n                           from the Courtroom\n\n      The contemporaneous objection rule requires an objection in the trial court\n\nbefore a defendant is entitled to plenary review on appeal. The rule \u201cfosters\n\nfinality of judgment and deters sandbagging\u201d by preventing a party from \u201csaving\n\nan issue for appeal in hopes of having another shot at trial if the first one misses.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 627 F.3d 1372, 1379 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation marks\n\nomitted). It also promotes \u201cthe salutary interest of making the trial the main event\u201d\n\nbecause \u201c[f]ailure to enforce it tends to detract from the perception of the trial of a\n\ncriminal case . . . as a decisive and portentous event.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted\n\nand ellipsis in original). By requiring timely objections, we \u201callow[] trial courts to\n\ndevelop a full record on [an] issue, consider the matter, and correct any error\n\nbefore substantial judicial resources are wasted on appeal and then in an\n\n                                           92\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 93 of 101\n\n\nunnecessary retrial.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). Finally, the rule provides\n\nsubstantial assistance for appellate review because \u201c[a] full record and a prior\n\ndecision in the district court are essential ingredients to our substantive review of\n\nissues.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). An objection allows for the \u201cthe record to\n\nbe made with respect to a constitutional claim when the recollections of witnesses\n\nare freshest\u201d and \u201cenables the judge who observed the demeanor of those witnesses\n\nto make the factual determinations necessary for properly deciding the federal\n\nconstitutional question.\u201d Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 88, 97 S.Ct. 2497,\n\n2507 (1977).\n\n      The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of the contemporaneous\n\nobjection rule and the values it supports. As the Court wrote in Sykes:\n\n      [When a] defendant has been accused of a serious crime, [the trial] is\n      the time and place set for him to be tried by a jury of his peers and\n      found either guilty or not guilty by that jury. To the greatest extent\n      possible all issues which bear on this charge should be determined in\n      this proceeding: the accused is in the court-room, the jury is in the\n      box, the judge is on the bench, and the witnesses, having been\n      subpoenaed and duly sworn, await their turn to testify. Society\u2019s\n      resources have been concentrated at that time and place in order to\n      decide, within the limits of human fallibility, the question of guilt or\n      innocence of one of its citizens. Any procedural rule which\n      encourages the result that those proceedings be as free of error as\n      possible is thoroughly desirable, and the contemporaneous-objection\n      rule surely falls within this classification.\n\nId. at 90, 97 S.Ct. at 2508.\n\n\n\n\n                                          93\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 94 of 101\n\n\n      By not objecting when he returned to the courtroom to testimony having\n\nbeen taken during his brief absence, Roy\u2019s trial counsel deprived the district court\n\nof an opportunity to address the problem on the spot, just after it occurred, and\n\nwhile everyone\u2019s recollection of the events were as fresh as they could be. If\n\ncounsel had objected, the attorneys and the judge could have decided what, if any,\n\naction was appropriate to remedy the problem. One possibility is that the court\n\ncould have had the court reporter, outside the presence of the jury, read to counsel\n\nthe questions and answers he had missed, and then let counsel decide whether he\n\nwanted some or all of them stricken and the jury instructed to disregard them. That\n\nway, when those questions were asked again in his presence, counsel could object\n\nto any of them for which there was any arguable basis for objection.\n\n      By requiring a timely objection, the contemporaneous objection rule\n\nencourages remedies. Instead of fostering that laudatory policy, the majority\u2019s\n\ndecision rewards counsel\u2019s silence with an automatic reversal. It \u201cencourage[s]\n\n\u2018sandbagging\u2019 on the part of defense lawyers.\u201d See id. at 89, 97 S.Ct. at 2508. As\n\nwe have asked before, \u201c[W]hat lawyer will not be \u2018understandably reluctant\u2019 to\n\nobject if no objection is required? By not objecting the lawyer can avoid any risk\n\nthat . . . an actual error [will be] corrected on the spot . . . .\u201d Rodriguez, 627 F.3d\n\nat 1380. By remaining silent, instead of objecting, under today\u2019s holding defense\n\n\n\n\n                                           94\n\f              Case: 12-15093       Date Filed: 08/05/2014      Page: 95 of 101\n\n\nattorneys can get \u201canother shot at trial if the first one misses.\u201d Id. at 1379\n\n(quotation marks omitted).\n\n B. Roy Has Failed to Show, or Even Assert, That His Counsel Was Unaware\n        That Testimony Had Been Taken During His Brief Absence\n\n       If Roy\u2019s attorney was unaware that testimony had been taken while he was\n\nabsent, his failure to object probably should be overlooked. But counsel must have\n\nknown, and Roy has never even suggested that counsel did not know.\n\n       Counsel knew that the judge had informed everyone before the lunch recess\n\nthat the trial would resume at 1:30 p.m., and he knew that he was walking in late.\n\nWhen counsel walked into the courtroom, the jury was sitting in the box, Deputy\n\nLongson was on the witness stand, and the prosecutor was asking the court for a\n\nmoment to approach defense counsel following Longson\u2019s response to one of her\n\nquestions. Id. at 108. The prosecutor then approached and conferred with defense\n\ncounsel, and although the record does not tell us what they discussed, it seems\n\nlikely that they talked about the fact that defense counsel had missed some\n\ntestimony. See id. Under all of the circumstances, it is extremely doubtful that\n\nRoy\u2019s attorney did not know that the trial had recommenced without him. 12\n\n\n\n\n       12\n           Even if the scene confronting defense counsel when he returned to the courtroom had\nnot signaled to him that the trial had continued in his absence, testimony from Deputy Longson\nsoon after counsel\u2019s return would have alerted him to that fact. With counsel back in the\ncourtroom, Longson specifically testified that one of the photos was one he had \u201cdescribed\nearlier\u201d showing \u201ca white female who is bound to a table by her feet with a red and white ski\n                                              95\n\f              Case: 12-15093       Date Filed: 08/05/2014      Page: 96 of 101\n\n\nIndeed, Roy has not even suggested that his attorney was unaware that he had\n\nmissed some of Longson\u2019s direct examination.\n\n       Because Roy\u2019s counsel failed to object to the error, our review should be for\n\nplain error only. See United States v. Williams, 527 F.3d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.\n\n2008). The majority\u2019s claim that we should not review the error that occurred at\n\nRoy\u2019s trial under the plain error standard is wrong because it relies on the faulty\n\npremise that a Cronic error occurred in this case. See Maj. Opn. at 21\u201322. None\n\nof the opinions that the majority relies on supports its position. First, the majority\n\nrelies on Justice Souter\u2019s dissent in Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 204, 122\n\nS.Ct. 1237, 1261 (2002) (Souter, J., dissenting), which was just that, a dissenting\n\nopinion, not an opinion of the Court. The dissenting opinion asserted that a court\u2019s\n\nerror should not be excused simply because an attorney failed to object, but that\n\nextreme position would apply to all judicial errors, thereby abolishing the\n\ncontemporaneous objection rule. Such a proposal is untenable and goes against the\n\nsettled law that defendants must object even to judicially created errors in order to\n\nproperly preserve them for full review on appeal. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nDavila, 749 F.3d 982, 993\u201394, 998\u201399 (11th Cir. 2014) (applying plain error\n\nreview where defendant failed to object to magistrate judge\u2019s \u201cemphatic and highly\n\n\nrope.\u201d The record shows that the only time that photo had been described earlier was during the\npart of Longson\u2019s testimony that occurred while counsel was out of the courtroom.\n\n\n                                              96\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 97 of 101\n\n\nimproper\u201d remarks \u201cregarding the desirability of a guilty plea\u201d). The majority also\n\nrelies on Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 265 n.5, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 1100 n.5\n\n(1981), but in that case the Supreme Court did not directly address an issue that\n\nhad not been properly preserved in the trial court. Instead, it remanded the case for\n\nconsideration of a possible due process violation that was apparent from the facts\n\nof the case but had not been raised on appeal or in the defendant\u2019s petition for\n\ncertiorari. Id. at 264\u201365, 101 S.Ct. at 1100. The Supreme Court chose that\n\napproach only for prudential reasons because it wanted to avoid deciding a novel\n\nconstitutional question that had been raised on appeal. Id. at 265, 101 S.Ct. at\n\n1100. Finally, the majority relies on our decision in Harding v. Davis, 878 F.2d\n\n1341 (11th Cir. 1989), but unlike this case, Harding involved actual Cronic error.\n\nIn that case, as a result of a disagreement with his client, defense counsel\n\n\u201cremained silent through virtually the entire trial, except for various remarks\n\nindicating that [the defendant] did not desire his assistance.\u201d Id. at 1343. As a\n\nresult, it was as though Harding had no counsel at all because his attorney\n\ncompletely failed to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to any meaningful adversarial\n\ntesting at all, an obvious Cronic violation. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct.\n\nat 2047. None of those opinions supports the majority\u2019s assertion that plain error\n\nreview is inappropriate in this case.\n\n                 C. Roy Cannot Prevail on Plain Error Review\n\n                                          97\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014     Page: 98 of 101\n\n\n      Under plain error review, Roy has the burden of establishing that \u201c(1) an\n\nerror occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected [his] substantial rights; and\n\n(4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d Rodriguez, 627\n\nF.3d at 1380 (quotation marks omitted). We need not look beyond the third\n\nrequirement to decide that Roy has not established plain error. To show that an\n\nerror affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights for plain error purposes, a defendant\n\nhas the burden of proving \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result\u201d but for the\n\nerror. Id. at 1382 (quotation marks omitted). If we cannot tell whether an\n\nunobjected to error prejudiced a defendant, the defendant loses. United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 398 F.3d 1291, 1299\u20131300 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that where it is\n\nuncertain whether prejudice exists, the defendant loses).\n\n      Roy has not come close to establishing a reasonable probability of a\n\ndifferent result but for his counsel\u2019s absence during seven minutes of testimony,\n\nless than one-half of one percent of the trial. In fact, the record overwhelmingly\n\nestablishes that the brief absence cannot have affected the jury\u2019s verdict on Count\n\n1. See supra pp. 29\u201332. Nor could it have affected the jury verdict on Counts 2 \u2013\n\n5. See supra pp. 32\u201333. There is no reasonable probability of a different result but\n\nfor the error, which the majority implicitly recognizes by insisting that we apply\n\nCronic and pretend that there was prejudice.\n\n             D. Roy Could Not Prevail Even Under Plenary Review\n\n                                           98\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014   Page: 99 of 101\n\n\n      Even if we ignore the failure to object, Roy\u2019s convictions should still be\n\naffirmed under plenary review because of the harmless error rule.\n\n      Contrary to the majority\u2019s argument, Maj. Opn. at 17\u201323, harmless error\n\nanalysis is not inappropriate, much less impossible, to apply to brief absences of\n\ncounsel from trial. (And the standard is not whether the error was de minimis, see\n\nMaj. Opn. at 27, but whether it was harmless. It is the harmless error rule, not the\n\nde minimis error rule.)\n\n      As the Supreme Court has held, application of the harmless error doctrine\n\n\u201cpromotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying\n\nfairness of the trial.\u201d Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1838\n\n(1999) (quotation marks omitted). When a constitutional violation occurs in a\n\ncriminal trial, harmless error analysis is the norm, not the exception. See, e.g.,\n\nFulminante, 499 U.S. at 306, 111 S.Ct. at 1263 (\u201cSince this Court\u2019s landmark\n\ndecision in Chapman v. California, in which we adopted the general rule that a\n\nconstitutional error does not automatically require reversal of a conviction, the\n\nCourt has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has\n\nrecognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u201d) (citation omitted)\n\n(emphasis added); Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 579, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 3106 (1986)\n\n(\u201c[I]f the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is\n\na strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to\n\n                                          99\n\f             Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 100 of 101\n\n\nharmless-error analysis. The thrust of the many constitutional rules governing the\n\nconduct of criminal trials is to ensure that those trials lead to fair and correct\n\njudgments. Where a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial\n\nestablishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the interest in fairness has been\n\nsatisfied and the judgment should be affirmed.\u201d). The majority\u2019s contrary position\n\nflies in the face of the Supreme Court\u2019s teaching in Fulminante, Chapman, Rose,\n\nand a host of other decisions. See also Vines, 28 F.3d at 1128 (applying harmless\n\nerror review after concluding \u201cthat the temporary absence of a defendant\u2019s trial\n\ncounsel during a portion of the actual trial does not necessarily affect the conduct\n\nof the entire trial\u201d).\n\n       The rule the majority adopts today, and its reversal of Roy\u2019s well-deserved\n\nconvictions without regard to whether the error affected the outcome of the trial,\n\nsmacks of a \u201csporting theory of justice.\u201d See United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97,\n\n108, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400 (1976) (quotation marks omitted). It will undermine\n\nfairness in the administration of justice by inviting reversals that have nothing to\n\ndo with the merits of a case. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized,\n\n\u201cReversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages litigants to\n\nabuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u201d Rose, 478 U.S. at\n\n579, 106 S.Ct. at 3106 (quotation marks omitted); accord Neder, 527 U.S. at 18,\n\n119 S.Ct. at 1838; Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544,\n\n                                           100\n\f            Case: 12-15093     Date Filed: 08/05/2014    Page: 101 of 101\n\n\n1550 (1997); see also Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 681, 106 S.Ct. at 1436 (\u201cAs we\n\nhave stressed on more than one occasion, the Constitution entitles a criminal\n\ndefendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97,\n\n122, 54 S.Ct. 330, 338 (1934) (\u201c[J]ustice, though due to the accused, is due to the\n\naccuser also. The concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to a\n\nfilament. We are to keep the balance true.\u201d).\n\n      The public loses confidence in the judicial process when reliable convictions\n\nare reversed on technical errors that did not affect the result. See United States v.\n\nKeys, 95 F.3d 874, 883 (9th Cir. 1996) (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhat really\n\nhurts the reputation of judicial proceedings is vacating a criminal conviction\n\nbecause of what laymen properly call a technicality, that is, a technical defect\n\nwhich made no practical difference in the particular case.\u201d) (quotation marks\n\nomitted), vacated, 520 U.S. 1226, 117 S.Ct. 1816 (1997). Any rule that requires us\n\nas judges to decide a case by pretending that something exists, when we as men\n\nand women know that it does not, risks undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the\n\nadministration of justice. That is another reason the majority\u2019s \u201cRoy rule\u201d is\n\nwrong.\n\n\n\n\n                                         101\n\f",
