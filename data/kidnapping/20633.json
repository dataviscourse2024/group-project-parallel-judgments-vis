Defendant  Reynaldo Vazquez\r                       _____________________\r\r          Rivera  was convicted of carjacking  in violation of  18 U.S.C.  \r\r          2119.   He claims that  the district court  committed two errors:\r\r          first,  by allowing the jury  to hear evidence  that he raped the\r\r          carjacking victim  and, second, by increasing  his sentence based\r\r          on a  finding that the  rape constituted \"serious  bodily injury\"\r\r          within the meaning of the statute's enhancement provision.1\r\r               The admissibility issue  is close.  We ultimately  have been\r\r          persuaded,  however,  that the  prejudicial  impact  of the  rape\r\r          evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value.   We\r\r          therefore  affirm  the  defendant's  conviction.    We  conclude,\r\r          however,  that  the  factual  record has  not  been  sufficiently\r\r          developed  to  support the  sentence  enhancement, and  therefore\r\r          remand  for  the  district  court to  reconsider  the  sentencing\r\r          options.\r\r                                    I.

According to  Crespo's testimony, defendant had a  gun that\r\r          he  put into his  waist as he  got out  of the car,  and which he\r\r          placed  on the car  roof before raping  her.  After  the assault,\r\r          defendant let Crespo go and he drove  off in her car.  She walked\r\r          along the road until  she encountered a police officer,  who took\r\r          her to a police station where  she gave an account of her ordeal.\r\r          A short time later, she was examined at a hospital  and then sent\r\r          home.\r\r               Defendant was  arrested about a  month after the  crime, and\r\r          was identified  by Crespo in a  lineup.  He was  charged with one\r\r          count of carjacking, the  indictment stating that he had  taken a\r\r          vehicle from  Crespo \"by  force and violence,  inflicting serious\r\r          bodily injury, that is: rape her.\"2\r\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               2 A  second count  charging that  appellant  used a  firearm\r          during a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C.   924(c) was\r          dismissed on double jeopardy  grounds.  Although the  court later\r          reconsidered the dismissal, it chose to let the  partial judgment\r          stand because  the  government  had  not  sought  review  of  the\r          dismissal.\r\r                                         -4-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r               In  a  motion in  limine,  Vazquez asked  that  the \"serious\r\r          bodily  injury/rape\"  language  be deleted  from  the  indictment\r\r          because  it related only to the sentence enhancement portion of  \r\r          2119  and not to the offense conduct itself.3  The district court\r\r          denied  the  motion.    Defendant  sought  reconsideration,  and,\r\r          because his defense would rest entirely on his claim  that he did\r\r          not  have a gun,4 he urged the  court to compel the government to\r\r          accept  his stipulation to the element of \"force and violence\" or\r\r          \"intimidation\" so  as to  make evidence  of the  rape irrelevant.\r\r          The court  again denied the motion, stating  that \"the government\r\r          has a right to present all  the facts that . . . show  that there\r\r          was a revolver involved.\"\r\r               The    testimony   at    the   three-day    trial   revealed\r\r          inconsistencies in law enforcement reports of Crespo's statements\r\r          about  what weapons she had seen and when she had seen them.  The\r\r          police  officer  who first  encountered  her  testified that  she\r\r          reported being  approached by an  individual with a gun.   In her\r\r          own  cross-examination,  Crespo  denied  saying that  a  gun  was\r\r          involved  in the original assault  and stated that  she first saw\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               3 As noted earlier, see note 1 supra,   2119(1) provides for\r                                   ___        _____\r          a 15-year maximum term, which is enhanced under subsection (2) to\r          a 25-year maximum if \"serious bodily injury\" results.  Subsection\r          (3)  provides  that, if  death  results,  the  carjacker  may  be\r          imprisoned for life.\r\r               4  As indicated  earlier, see note  1 supra,  the carjacking\r                                         ___         _____\r          statute  under  which  Vazquez  was convicted  included  firearms\r          possession as one  of its elements.  Section 2119  has since been\r          amended  to substitute the phrase \"with the intent to cause death\r          or serious bodily harm\" for the language requiring  possession of\r          a firearm.  See  United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67  F.3d 993, 996\r                      ___  _____________    ____________\r          n.1 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\r                                         -5-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          the   gun  at  Naguabo.    Notes  made  by  another  officer  who\r\r          interviewed  her  when she  was  brought  to the  Naguabo  police\r\r          station referred only to a knife or similar sharp object.  An FBI\r\r          agent  testified that Crespo first  mentioned seeing a knife near\r\r          the driver's seat of the  car a few days before trial.  The trial\r\r          transcript also contains at least ten references to the rape. \r\r               Vazquez was convicted, and subsequently was sentenced to the\r\r          statutory maximum  term of twenty-five years'  imprisonment based\r\r          on the court's finding that  the rape constituted \"serious bodily\r\r          injury.\"  Vazquez unsuccessfully  argued that the enhancement was\r\r          inapplicable because  the record failed  to show that  Crespo had\r\r          suffered \"extreme physical pain,\" and the district court likewise\r\r          rejected his contention that an evidentiary hearing was necessary\r\r          to resolve the factual issue of serious bodily injury.\r\r               This appeal followed.\r\r                              Admission of Rape Evidence\r                              __________________________\r\r               Defendant asserts that  prejudicial error  was committed  by\r\r          the  court in admitting evidence  of the victim's  rape, since it\r\r          was unnecessary to  prove any of the elements of  carjacking.  He\r\r          invokes  Fed. R. Evid. 403,  which compels the  exclusion of even\r\r          relevant  evidence  \"if  its  probative  value  is  substantially\r\r          outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\"\r\r               In reviewing this claim, we are mindful of several cautions.\r\r          The first is  Rule 403  itself.  The  admitted evidence must  not\r\r          only be prejudicial,  but be unfairly  prejudicial, and not  only\r\r          outweigh relevance but substantially outweigh relevance.

If,  however, the government's need for\r          the rape  evidence is  not otherwise substantially  outweighed by\r          the  risk  of unfair  prejudice  to the  defendant,  the district\r          court's rejection of such  a stipulation would not constitute  an\r          abuse of  discretion.  See United States v. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1, 3\r                                 ___ _____________    _______\r          (1st Cir. 1994) (en banc) (affirming  \"the government's `right to\r          \"present to the jury a picture  of the events relied upon,\"'. . .\r          including  proof of  all  elements of  the  crime for  which  the\r          defendant has been brought to trial\") (citations omitted).  \r\r                                         -8-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          violence\" element, here, defendant  already had seized control of\r\r          the vehicle, wielding a  weapon that Crespo later realized  was a\r\r          knife.    At  best,  therefore,  testimony  about  the  rape  was\r\r          cumulative evidence of the use of force.\r\r               A weightier  claim  of relevance  is that  knowledge of  the\r\r          sexual  assault was  important  to the  jury's  ability to  fully\r\r          evaluate Crespo's credibility.  A jury reasonably might attribute\r\r          inconsistencies in her reports  of the crime to her  distress and\r\r          disorientation  in the aftermath of the rape.  The government, no\r\r          less  than  the defendant,  is entitled  to  the benefit  of such\r\r          reasonable inferences.\r\r               We  therefore conclude  that  the evidence  of rape  was not\r\r          devoid of relevance.  Were this all that could be mustered on the\r\r          side  of  admitting  the  evidence,  we  might   have  found  the\r\r          concededly highly prejudicial evidence  of rape to meet the  Rule\r\r          403  standard  of substantial  disproportion.   But we  also must\r\r          consider  the  fact  that the  events  at  Naguabo  related to  a\r\r          critical element of the then crime of carjacking -- possession of\r\r          a firearm.\r\r               The defense was  based solely on the  theory that possession\r\r          of a  firearm had  not been proved  beyond a reasonable  doubt, a\r\r          plausible argument given the law enforcement reports of differing\r\r          statements  from  Crespo.    The  only  direct evidence  was  the\r\r          testimony we have quoted.\r\r               Crespo's  testimony of the conduct leading up to the rape --\r\r          particularly  defendant's order that she get down on all fours --\r\r\r                                         -9-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          provided an important  explanation for her  having heard but  not\r\r          seen the  gun  being  placed  on  the car  roof.    Without  this\r\r          evidence,  the  prosecution would  be  significantly  hampered in\r\r          providing  the jury  with  the answers  to  a series  of  logical\r\r          questions: why didn't  she see  the gun? where  was she  looking?\r\r          what was shedoing? why wasthe weapon placed onthe roof ofthe car?\r\r               Simply preventing  the witness  from stating, \"And  he raped\r\r          me\"  would  do nothing  --  or  very,  very  little --  to  avoid\r\r          prejudice.  The victim had been taken to a remote  beach, ordered\r\r          to take her  clothes off, get  out of  the car, and  \"get on  all\r\r          fours.\"  The jurors would draw the logical inference.  To require\r\r          excision as well of all of the suggestive evidence not only would\r\r          have unrealistically  telescoped the events at  Naguabo, but also\r\r          would have stripped Crespo's  testimony concerning the firearm of\r\r          much  of its credit worthiness.   As the  Fifth Circuit stated in\r\r          United  States v.

Although we can understand the\r\r          court's  desire to punish  the defendant heavily,  and agree with\r\r          its  view  that the  crime  was  \"degrading, heinous,  cruel  and\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               6 We  recognize that the district  court's relative weighing\r          of probativeness  and prejudice focused  on the rape  evidence as\r          relevant  to  the issue  of \"force  and  violence.\"   Because the\r          testimony is highly probative on the issue of firearm possession,\r          we are comfortable affirming its judgment on a somewhat different\r          basis. \r\r                                         -11-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          brutal,\" there is no record evidence that Crespo suffered  either\r\r          \"extreme physical pain\" or any of the other listed injuries.  She\r\r          testified  only   that  she  was  raped,   without  any  specific\r\r          description  of the assault.   The presentence report states that\r\r          defendant raped Crespo for about five minutes, but also lacks any\r\r          elaboration.  A medical  report filed as part of  the presentence\r\r          report indicates that, approximately  two hours after the attack,\r\r          there was no evidence of any cuts or bruises in her vaginal area.\r\r               The government suggests that, notwithstanding the absence of\r\r          actual physical injury with pain, the court properly could  apply\r\r          the   enhancement  based  on   \"extreme  physical  pain\"  because\r\r          \"Congress  never  intended  rigid  limiting  definitions  for the\r\r          `serious  bodily  injury'  terminology\".   The  cases  it  cites,\r\r          however, do not  support this  proposition.  For  the most  part,\r\r          they  involve construction  of  the  somewhat different  \"serious\r\r          bodily    injury\"   provision   contained   in   the   Sentencing\r\r          Guidelines,7 and  many also feature evidence  of painful injuries\r\r          suffered  by the victim.

The\r\r          effort  of  the district  court  and  government to  reflect  the\r\r          severity of  that crime through a flexible  interpretation of the\r\r          \"serious bodily injury\" requirement is  therefore understandable.\r\r          The  statute by  its  terms, however,  limits its  application to\r\r          specific types of injury, and the government cites no legislative\r\r          history, nor has our own research uncovered  any, suggesting that\r\r          the subsections were meant to be less than all-inclusive.9\r\r               To say that  any rape, regardless  of the circumstances,  is\r\r          equivalent to these specified  harms would broaden measurably the\r\r          limited   category  of  injuries   that  Congress  designated  as\r\r          justifying a  substantial increase in  punishment for carjacking.\r                                                                __________\r\r          It  would  be, in  effect,  to add  punishment  for  rape to  the\r\r          carjacking  scheme,  which  already represents  somewhat  unusual\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               9    Although a  rape of any  type surely is  a sufficiently\r                    serious  physical  invasion  to  justify  a  sentencing\r                    enhancement, the statute  as written requires  evidence\r                    of the specific, objective types of harm set out there.\r                    It may be  that, in choosing the  definition of serious\r                    bodily  injury  contained in     1365,  a statute  that\r                    penalizes the tampering of consumer products, see supra\r                                                                  ___ _____\r                    at 10,  Congress did  not recognize the  limitations of\r                    its language.  \r\r                                         -14-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          federal  intervention  into  a  typically state-law  realm.    We\r\r          decline  to  stretch the  language  Congress  wrote without  some\r\r          indication that it meant the provision to be elastic.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                 ___  ____\r\r          United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 588 (1st Cir. 1996)(the rule\r          _____________    _____\r\r          of lenity holds  that \"the harsher of two possible  readings of a\r\r          criminal statute will be  enforced only when Congress has  spoken\r\r          clearly\").10\r\r               The defendant's  sentence  thus must  be  vacated.   If  the\r\r          government continues to  seek the   2119(2)  enhancement, it must\r\r          provide some basis  upon which the court may conclude that one or\r\r          more of the statutory  conditions of harm occurred.   Contrary to\r\r          defendant's assertion,  an evidentiary hearing  is not necessary.\r\r          Rule  32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that\r\r          counsel  for  the  defendant  and  the  government  be  given  an\r\r          opportunity  to  comment at  the  sentencing  hearing on  matters\r\r          relating to the appropriate sentence, but the decision whether to\r\r          conduct an evidentiary hearing  is within the court's discretion.\r\r          Fed.  R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1).11   The court,  however, must resolve\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               10  Indeed, we think there is some question whether the rape\r          is at all relevant  to defendant's punishment under    2119 since\r          it was not the \"force and violence\" by which he gained control of\r          the  vehicle.   Arguably,  the conduct  punishable  under    2119\r          occurred  at the Isla  Verde Marginal Road  when Vazquez forcibly\r          took control of  Crespo's car, and  the subsequent abduction  and\r          rape were separate violations of state law.  We need not consider\r          the scope of a carjacking  here, however, because defendant  does\r          not raise such a claim.  He argues  only that the court could not\r          apply  the enhancement  in  the  absence  of  proof  of  \"extreme\r          physical pain\" or some other listed harm.\r\r               11 The case relied on by defendant, Specht v. Patterson, 386\r                                                   ______    _________\r          U.S.  605 (1967), is inapposite.   In that  case, the Court ruled\r          that  due  process required  notice  and  a  hearing  before  the\r\r                                         -15-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          objections to the  presentence report, and  make findings on  any\r\r          controverted matter taken into account in sentencing.  Id.12\r                                                                 ___\r\r               For the foregoing reasons, we affirm defendant's conviction,\r\r          but vacate  the sentence  and remand for  resentencing consistent\r\r          with the principles expressed in this opinion.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r          defendant, who  had been  convicted for indecent  liberties under\r          one  Colorado  statute, could  be  sentenced  under the  separate\r          Colorado  Sex   Offenders  Act,   which  contained   more  severe\r          penalties.  Here, the enhancement at issue is part of the statute\r          under which the defendant was charged and convicted.\r\r               12 We note that  the government partially defended admission\r          of the rape evidence based on an assertion that   2119 required a\r          jury  finding  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  on  \"serious  bodily\r          injury,\"  and further  claimed that  the jury's  verdict reflects\r          such a determination.  The government's position is flawed in two\r          respects.     First,  the   verdict  does  not   support  such  a\r          determination because  the jury made no specific  findings on the\r          defendant's conduct.  Second,  we have held that the  alternative\r          penalty  provisions  of     2119  are  sentence  enhancers  whose\r          applicability is  a  matter for  the judge,  not the  jury.
