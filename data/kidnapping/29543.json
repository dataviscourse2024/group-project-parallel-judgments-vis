            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION\nWARREN, Justice.\nA jury convicted appellant of murder and assessed punishment at life in prison.\nIn his first of six points of error, appellant complains that the trial court erred in admitting, over objection, exculpatory statements made by appellant while \u201cin custody.\u201d\nThe record shows that appellant called the Harris County Sheriffs Office on August 16, 1987 and reported that his infant son, Steven Cox, had been abducted from appellant\u2019s apartment by a white woman named Linda. Several police officers from the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office arrived at appellant\u2019s apartment and interviewed the appellant in connection with the alleged abduction of Steven. At this time, appellant appeared to be an extremely agitated and concerned father of an abducted infant. Appellant rode with one of the officers as they drove around the immediate area of the apartments looking for Linda and Steven. The search was futile.\nThe officers then requested that appellant accompany them to the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s substation so that they could obtain additional information about the abduction. Specifically, the investigators questioned appellant about Linda\u2019s name, her physical description, and the details of her contact with the appellant and Steven.\nAppellant told the police that he did not know Linda\u2019s last name, that she was white, and that she had come to his apartment to buy drugs. He told them that he had met Linda on the street at some time in the past, and sold her drugs on a previous occasion, but that he refused to sell her any drugs when she showed up at his apartment on August 16. He further told them that he left Steven with Linda in the front room of the apartment while he made a phone call and that when he returned to the room, both Linda and Steven were gone.\nIn the course of the investigation, and partly because they believed the appellant\u2019s story to be highly improbable, one of the officers investigating the alleged abduction checked on appellant\u2019s prior criminal record. This check disclosed a conviction for injury to a child.\nAt the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, the officers testified that they felt they needed some verification of the truthfulness of the appellant\u2019s abduction story to justify the continuation of the investigation, and that they requested that appellant submit to a polygraph examination.\nAppellant agreed, and accompanied two officers to the main office of the sheriff\u2019s department in downtown Houston, where he was to be given the polygraph examination. While waiting for the polygraph examiner to prepare the test, appellant talked freely with the investigating officers about the abduction. The officers gave him coffee and shared their cigarettes with him.\nAppellant then asked the officers to direct him to the restroom, and the officer in charge told him that he would take him there because the access to the restroom in that area of the building was restricted and required a key card. The officer accompanied appellant to the restroom, waited for him, then let them both back into the work area with his key card, and returned to his desk.\nThe polygraph examination focused on the details of the appellant\u2019s abduction story. The examiner asked a series of ques*712tions about the abduction of Steven by Linda, and whether the appellant knew where Steven was. At the conclusion of the polygraph examination, the examiner informed the appellant that the test indicated that the appellant had not been truthful. Appellant then told the polygraph examiner that he wanted to talk to the investigating officer. The examiner relayed this message to the officer, and also told the officer that, in his opinion, appellant had failed the test.\nAppellant asked the officer if they could go somewhere and talk, and the officer suggested they could go outside. Appellant agreed, and he and the officer walked outside to the driveway area beside the building. During this conversation, appellant told the officer that Steven was dead and that he would take the officer to the body if he and the officer went alone. The officer then placed appellant under arrest and read him the Miranda1 warnings.\nAppellant continued talking with the officer until they arrived at the appellant\u2019s apartment complex. During the ride to the apartment complex, appellant told the officer that Steven had died early on the morning of August 16, and that he had placed the body in a dumpster.\nAlthough appellant told the officer an exculpatory version of the incidents leading up to Steven\u2019s death, the officer testified about this version only during the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, but not at trial.\nAfter arriving at the apartment complex, appellant directed the officer to the garbage dumpster in which Steven\u2019s body was later found.\nAppellant\u2019s first point of error complains of the admission of appellant\u2019s \u201cexculpatory\u201d in-custody statements, but fails to identify the exact statements complained of. Nonetheless, the only statements of the appellant admitted at trial were (1) the statements about the abduction of Steven by Linda; (2) the statements after the polygraph examination that Steven was dead, and that he would take the officer to the body; and (3) appellant\u2019s assertive conduct in identifying the dumpster in which Steven\u2019s body was found. Of these, the only potentially \u201cexculpatory\u201d statements are those in which appellant told the officers that Steven had been abducted by Linda.2\nIn ruling upon appellant\u2019s first point of error, we address only whether the trial court erred in admitting the officer\u2019s testimony of what appellant told them about the alleged abduction. Whether the statements were \u201cexculpatory\u201d or \u201cincriminating,\u201d they should have been suppressed if illegally obtained. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); Lewis v. State, 737 S.W.2d 857, 861 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, pet. ref\u2019d).\nIt cannot be seriously maintained that appellant\u2019s exculpatory statements about the abduction of Steven by Linda resulted in any way from custodial interrogation by any police officers. Instead of resulting from any custodial interrogation, appellant first volunteered the abduction story to the police dispatcher, and then to the patrol officers investigating the complaint of abduction.\nIt would be unreasonable to hold that Miranda, or Tex.Code Crim.P.Ann. arts. 38.22, 38.23 (Vernon Supp.1988), require the suppression of false statements volunteered by an accused who is not in custody. At the time appellant first related the abduction story, there was no ongoing investigation, much less any custodial interrogation. See Shiflet v. State, 732 S.W.2d 622 (Tex.Crim.App.1985). In fact, the only point of police involvement in the entire affair was precisely to investigate *713the abduction allegations that appellant volunteered after initiating the contact with police.\nThe abduction story was a statement voluntarily made while appellant was not under arrest, and before there was even a police investigation. Such statements are always admissible. Davis v. State, 692 S.W.2d 185, 187 (Tex.App.\u2014 Houston [1st Dist.] 1985, no pet.). The fact that appellant repeated the story to several different investigating officers during the afternoon of August 16, and that he was ultimately arrested and charged with murder, cannot logically transform the abduction story into one that resulted from custodial interrogation. See also Shiflet, 732 S.W.2d at 628.\nAppellant\u2019s first point of error is overruled.\nIn his second point of error, appellant complains that the evidence was insufficient to support the alternative allegation in the indictment, that the object allegedly used by the appellant to cause the death of the complainant was unknown to the grand jury.\nThe indictment in this case charged that appellant caused Steven\u2019s death by intentionally and knowingly committing an act clearly dangerous to human life, namely, by striking Steven \u201cwith an object unknown to the grand jury.\u201d The indictment charged in the alternative that appellant intentionally and knowingly caused the death of Steven by striking him with his hand.\nWhen an indictment alleges that the manner and means used to inflict an injury is unknown, and the evidence at trial does not show what type of object was used, a prima facie showing exists that the object was unknown to the grand jury. Washington v. State, 677 S.W.2d 142, 145 (Tex.App.\u2014 Dallas 1984, no pet.); see also Cunningham v. State, 484 S.W.2d 906, 911 (Tex.Crim.App.1972). Here, the grand jury foreman testified that the grand jury investigated the cause of death, but were unable to determine the object used to cause the injury. There were no eyewitnesses to the infliction of the injuries other than the appellant, and he did not testify at trial. The pathologist who performed the autopsy on Steven also testified that he was unable to determine the specific object used to cause the death. Nothing more specific was developed at trial concerning the object used to inflict the injuries. Further, from all the evidence, it appears that additional investigation by the grand jury could not have determined the exact manner or means or the instruments used to inflict death. Simon v. State, 488 S.W.2d 439, 444 (Tex.Crim.App.1972). Expressed another way, even if the grand jury had been in possession of all the evidence introduced at trial, they would have been unable to identify the exact nature of the object used to inflict the injuries. See Cunningham, 484 S.W.2d at 911. The evidence was therefore sufficient to support the indictment as alleged.\nAppellant\u2019s second point of error is overruled.\nIn his third point of error, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant caused the complainant\u2019s death by striking him with his hand, or with an object unknown to the grand jury.\nIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction, the question is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).\nHere, appellant was shown to have been a black belt expert in the martial arts. The medical evidence established that in all probability Steven\u2019s death resulted from a blow to the head. While none of the doctors was able to specify the exact manner in which the blow was administered, the medical evidence was that Steven\u2019s injury did not result from a fall, or from any other self-inflicted injury. In fact, one doctor specifically denied the possibility that Steven\u2019s injury could have been self-inflicted.\n*714Viewing all the evidence, including the evidence of the appellant\u2019s conduct and statements after Steven\u2019s death, the manner in which appellant disposed of Steven\u2019s body by throwing it into a garbage dumpster, and the medical evidence, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we hold that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.\nAppellant\u2019s third point of error is overruled.\nIn points of error four, five, and six, appellant complains of the admission of an extraneous offense and improper jury argument. Appellant, however, has failed to brief or argue any of these points of error. In support of these points of error, appellant has merely stated that a statement of facts, argument, and authorities under each point of error would be filed with this Court in the form of a supplemental brief within 30 days of the filing of the brief. No such supplemental brief has ever been filed. In the absence of any supporting briefing or argument, these points of error present nothing for review. Tex.R.App.P. 74(f); McWherter v. State, 607 S.W.2d 531, 536 (Tex.Crim.App.1980).\nAppellant\u2019s fourth, fifth, and sixth points of error are overruled.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n\n\n. Although not the subject of a point of error on appeal, we note that the remaining statements, each mainly concerned with the fact of Steven\u2019s death, and the location of Steven\u2019s body, were assertions of fact and circumstances that were found to be true, and that conduced to establish the guilt of the appellant. As such, they were admissible under Tex.Code Crim.P.Ann. art. 38.-22(3)(c) (Vernon Supp.1988). See Ex parte Stansbery, 702 S.W.2d 643, 647 (Tex.Crim.App.1986).\n\n",
