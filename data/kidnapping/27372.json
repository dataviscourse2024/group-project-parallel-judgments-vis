JoAnna\nGibson McFadden, Assistant United States Attorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES\nATTORNEY, Greensboro, North Carolina, for Appellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n       Following their guilty pleas to one count each of kidnapping, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1201(a)(1) (count 4), brandishing firearms during and in relation to the\n\ncrime of violence of kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 924(c)(2)(A)(ii) (count 5),\n\nand possession of stolen firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 922(j) (count 6), the\n\ndistrict court sentenced James Ray Bullard and Danny Bullard to 175 months\u2019\n\nimprisonment and 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively, and five years each of\n\nsupervised release. The district court later granted James\u2019 and Danny\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n\nmotions, vacated their convictions on count 5, and ordered that they be resentenced. At\n\nresentencing in November 2019, the district court calculated James\u2019 sentencing range\n\nunder the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (2018) at 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment\n\nand Danny\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines at 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe court sentenced James to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment on count 4, a concurrent term of\n\n120 months\u2019 imprisonment on count 6, and to concurrent supervised release terms of 5 and\n\n3 years. The court sentenced Danny to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment on count 4, a concurrent\n\nterm of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on count 6, and to concurrent supervised release terms\n\nof 5 and 3 years.\n\n       On appeal from the second amended criminal judgments imposing these terms,\n\ncounsel have filed a joint brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967),\n\nstating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising as issues for review\n\nwhether the 151 and 168-month prison terms are substantively reasonable and whether the\n\ndistrict court erred in imposing warrantless searches as a special condition of supervised\n\n                                             3\n\frelease. The Government declined to file a brief. James and Danny filed a pro se\n\nsupplemental brief raising as an issue whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance\n\nin connection with resentencing. We affirm.\n\n       \u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) using an\n\nabuse-of-discretion standard, regardless of \u2018whether [the sentence is] inside, just outside,\n\nor significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d United States v. Nance, 957 F.3d 204, 212\n\n(4th Cir. 2020) (quoting Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007)). In conducting this\n\nreview, we first ensure that the district court did not commit any significant procedural\n\nerror, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating\n\nthe Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence\n\nbased on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Lymas, 781 F.3d 106, 111-12 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at\n\n51); see United States v. Provance, 944 F.3d 213, 217-19 (4th Cir. 2019).\n\n       If the sentence is procedurally sound, we then review it for substantive\n\nreasonableness. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. Substantive reasonableness review \u201ctakes into\n\naccount the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the sentencing court abused\n\nits discretion in concluding that the sentence it chose satisfied the standards set forth in\n\n\u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Nance, 957 F.3d at 212 (internal quotation marks omitted). Any sentence that\n\nis within or below a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively substantively\n\nreasonable, and Appellants bear the burden of demonstrating that the sentence is\n\nunreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.           United States v. White,\n\n810 F.3d 212, 230 (4th Cir. 2016).\n\n                                              4\n\f       After review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly calculated\n\nthe advisory Guidelines ranges, gave the parties adequate opportunities to argue for an\n\nappropriate sentence, properly heard James\u2019 and Danny\u2019s allocutions, considered the\n\n\u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sufficiently explained the chosen sentences. Because James and\n\nDanny have failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that we afford to their\n\nbelow-Guidelines-range sentences, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in imposing the 151 and 168-month prison terms.\n\n       Counsel also question whether the district court erred in imposing, as a special\n\ncondition of supervised release, that James and Danny submit themselves, their \u201cresidence,\n\noffice, vehicle, or any property under [their] control to a warrantless search\u201d to be\n\nconducted by the probation officer at \u201ca reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, based\n\nupon reasonable suspicion of contraband or evidence of a violation of a condition of\n\nrelease.\u201d Because James and Danny did not object to this special condition at resentencing,\n\nwe review only for plain error. See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 441 F.3d 767,\n\n772 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\n       Although district courts are \u201cafforded broad latitude to impose conditions on\n\nsupervised release,\u201d special conditions of release must be \u201creasonably related\u201d to the\n\nsentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(1). United States v. Douglas, 850 F.3d\n\n660, 663 (4th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Those factors include: \u201cthe\n\nnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the\n\ndefendant;\u201d the need for adequate deterrence; the protection of the public from further\n\ncrimes; and providing the defendant training or treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(1) (citing\n\n                                            5\n\fid. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D)). The special conditions imposed also must\n\nbe consistent with policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission and must\n\ninvolve \u201cno greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\u201d to achieve the goals\n\nof supervised release. Douglas, 850 F.3d at 663 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2), (d)(3)).\n\nAfter review of the record, we conclude that the condition is reasonable, given James\u2019 and\n\nDanny\u2019s backgrounds and the need for the district court to protect the public. James and\n\nDanny thus fail to show plain error.\n\n       James and Danny question whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in\n\nconnection with resentencing. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\n\ndefendant must show (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687 (1984). However, we may address a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal\n\nonly if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the face of the record. United\n\nStates v. Faulls, 821 F.3d 502, 507-08 (4th Cir. 2016). After review, we conclude that\n\nineffective assistance by trial counsel does not conclusively appear on the face of this\n\nrecord. We therefore decline to address these claims.\n\n       Finally, in accordance with Anders, we have reviewed the remainder of the record\n\nand have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the second amended\n\ncriminal judgments. This court requires that counsel inform James and Danny, in writing,\n\nof the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If James\n\nor Danny request that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\ffrivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation.\n\nCounsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on James or Danny.\n\n      We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\n\nadequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the\n\ndecisional process.\n\n                                                                            AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f",
