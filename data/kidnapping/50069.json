FORBES, J.:\n\n                   Brian Kramer-Kelly (\u201cKramer-Kelly\u201d) appeals his convictions of rape\n\nand kidnapping. After reviewing the facts of the case and pertinent law, we reverse\n\nthe trial court\u2019s decision, vacate Kramer-Kelly\u2019s convictions and prison sentence,\n\fand remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n I.   Facts and Procedural History\n\n              This case concerns Kramer-Kelly\u2019s convictions of the October 2018\n\nrape of L.W. in Brecksville and the June 2019 rape of S.S. in Cleveland. Kramer-\n\nKelly and his codefendant Anthony Guzi (\u201cGuzi\u201d) were initially indicted on April 12,\n\n2019, for raping L.W. in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-19-637946-A. Trial was set for\n\nMarch 2, 2020. However, on February 27, 2020, the state reindicted Kramer-Kelly\n\nand Guzi for raping and kidnapping L.W. in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-20-648409-A.\n\nIn this new indictment, the state also included rape and kidnapping charges against\n\nKramer-Kelly concerning the rape of S.S. On April 23, 2020, the state dismissed\n\nCR-19-637946-A.\n\n              Kramer-Kelly\u2019s indictment in CR-20-648409-A includes the\n\nfollowing seven counts: three counts of rape and one count of kidnapping in relation\n\nto L.W.; and two counts of rape and one count of kidnapping in relation to S.S. All\n\nrape counts include sexually violent predator specifications and both kidnapping\n\ncounts include sexual motivation and sexually violent predator specifications. Guzi\n\nwas also charged with two counts of rape and one count of kidnapping in relation to\n\nL.W., along with the aforementioned specifications.\n\n              On March 4, 2020, Kramer-Kelly filed a motion for severance of the\n\ncounts concerning L.W. from the counts concerning S.S. The court held a hearing\n\non this motion in July 2020, and denied Kramer-Kelly\u2019s request.\n\f               The case proceeded to trial, and on December 13, 2021, a jury found\n\nKramer-Kelly guilty of all five rape counts concerning L.W. and S.S. and one count\n\nof kidnapping with a sexual motivation specification in relation to S.S. The jury\n\nacquitted Kramer-Kelly of the kidnapping count concerning L.W. That same day,\n\nthe court found Kramer-Kelly guilty of the sexually violent predator specifications\n\non all counts of which Kramer-Kelly was convicted.\n\n               On January 6, 2022, the court vacated the sexually violent predator\n\nspecification convictions and held a hearing on these specifications. On January 19,\n\n2022, the court found Kramer-Kelly guilty of the three sexually violent predator\n\nspecifications associated with S.S. and not guilty of the sexually violent predator\n\nspecifications associated with L.W. The court sentenced Kramer-Kelly to life in\n\nprison with the possibility of parole after 21 years.\n\n               On March 15, 2022, Guzi pled guilty to gross sexual imposition,\n\npandering obscenity, and abduction in relation to L.W., and the court sentenced him\n\nto nine months in prison.\n\nII.      Trial Testimony and Evidence\n\n               The state presented testimony and evidence at trial in the following\n\norder.\n\n         A. Holly Oster\n\n               Holly Oster (\u201cOster\u201d) testified that she works at London Pickle Works\n\n(\u201cthe Pickle\u201d), which is a bar and restaurant in Brecksville.     On the night of\n\nOctober 5, 2018, and into the early morning hours of October 6, 2018, Oster was\n\f\u201cwaitressing\u201d at the Pickle, and it was \u201cvery busy.\u201d Oster knows L.W. as \u201ca somewhat\n\nregular at the bar.\u201d L.W. was at the Pickle with \u201ca bunch of people\u201d that night. A\n\n\u201ccouple days\u201d later, Oster got a phone call from the police, and \u201cthey stopped in\u201d to\n\nthe Pickle. Oster went to the police department and spoke with \u201csomebody * * *\n\nabout something that happened.\u201d Oster testified that she had \u201cno direct or personal\n\nknowledge\u201d about what happened to L.W. after she left the Pickle on the night in\n\nquestion.\n\n              According to Oster, L.W. \u201cseemed to be having a good time\u201d that\n\nnight, and she did not \u201cseem like she was way out of things.\u201d L.W. was walking \u201cfine\u201d\n\nand she was not stumbling. Asked if L.W. looked \u201canywhere near like she was\n\nblacked out,\u201d Oster answered, \u201cAt the point when I saw her, no.\u201d Oster did not see\n\nL.W. leave the bar that night.\n\n      B. Michael Dinallo\n\n              Michael Dinallo (\u201cDinallo\u201d) testified that he and L.W. \u201cwere always\n\nkind of on and off for the five years that we have known each other,\u201d although they\n\nwere not dating on the night of the incident in question. Dinallo and L.W. went to\n\nthe Pickle around 10:30 p.m. on October 5, 2018. According to Dinallo, it was a\n\nbusier than usual night, and he and L.W. were \u201changing out * * * near the bar\n\ntowards the right.\u201d They interacted with Kramer-Kelly and Guzi, who were sitting\n\nnext to them at the bar. According to Dinallo, L.W. became \u201ca little bit flirtatious\u201d\n\nwith Guzi.\n\f                At some point that night, Dinallo told L.W. that he wanted to go\n\nhome. L.W. told Dinallo that she did not want to leave. Dinallo left the Pickle\n\nwithout L.W. Within two minutes after he left the Pickle, he got a phone call from\n\nL.W. Dinallo testified that L.W. \u201cdidn\u2019t say anything. It was more I would say bar\n\nsounds, and then the phone got disconnected. And I tried calling her back and no\n\none answered. That was the last that I spoke to her that night.\u201d According to Dinallo,\n\nL.W. had \u201ca few shots\u201d that night, but he did not remember how many.\n\n                L.W. called Dinallo from her laptop the next morning at 9:15 to say\n\nthat she lost her phone. Dinallo picked L.W. up and took her to the Pickle to look\n\nfor her phone.       According to Dinallo, L.W. \u201cdefinitely seemed a little off.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Dinallo, L.W., and L.W.\u2019s mother went to the hospital \u201cto get a rape\n\nkit.\u201d\n\n                During trial, Dinallo testified as follows:\n\n        Q: Can you talk to the jury about the impact that reporting this and\n        getting a rape kit has had, that you have observed that had on [L.W.]\n        and it has had on you?\n\n        ***\n\n        A: I mean, there \u2014 no one would want to go through the process of,\n        you know, getting a rape kit done. Doing this for three years. There\u2019s\n        just no way.\n\n        ***\n\n        I mean, initially it had a tremendous impact. Just this \u2014 it took a\n        mental toll on her. Obviously, on our relationship. And then, you know\n        \u2014 yeah. I mean, it\u2019s been tough. I mean, it seems like it\u2019s \u2014 when she\n        thinks that it\u2019s over with, that she doesn\u2019t have to think about it, it kind\n        of comes back, and I think that\u2019s the hardest part.\n\f      ***\n\n      Q: And can you tell the jury a little bit about kind of that process, of\n      just mentally gearing yourself up for coming in and talking to 14\n      strangers about what happened in October of 2018?\n\n      ***\n\n      A: Yeah. It\u2019s strange. I mean, it\u2019s nothing you want to talk to strangers\n      about. I mean, it does take a toll on you. Like I said before, you know,\n      you don\u2019t hear anything for weeks, months, and then it\u2019s kind of out of\n      your head at that point. And then it kind of comes back. And just, you\n      know, it\u2019s a hard process.\n\n      Q: Okay. Is there anything about this process that * * * you think is\n      easy?\n\n      A: Absolutely not.\n\n               On cross-examination, Dinallo testified that at no point during the\n\nnight in question did the bartender at the Pickle cut off or stop serving L.W.\n\nAccording to Dinallo, when he left the bar that evening, L.W. \u201cwasn\u2019t really * * * that\n\ndrunk.\u201d\n\n      C. L.W.\n\n               L.W. testified that on the night of October 5, 2018, and into the early\n\nmorning hours of October 6, 2018, she and Dinallo went to the Pickle. L.W. and\n\nDinallo were good friends who had previously dated. L.W. saw Guzi, a high school\n\nclassmate of hers, at the bar. L.W. started talking and drinking with Guzi. Guzi\n\nintroduced L.W. to Kelly-Kramer as his \u201cboyfriend.\u201d L.W. testified that she was still\n\nsitting with Guzi and Kelly-Kramer when Dinallo left the bar.\n\n               According to L.W., her memory of that night is \u201cfoggy or hazy\u201d and\n\nparts of it \u201care just completely gone.\u201d L.W. recalled that, not long after Dinallo left\n\fthe Pickle, Guzi and Kelly-Kramer helped her \u201cout to the car\u201d because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t\n\nstand up\u201d and she \u201chad too much to drink.\u201d L.W. testified that she hit her head \u201con\n\ntheir car.\u201d L.W. described her state that night as: \u201cMe falling all over the place,\n\nunable to form a full sentence, unable to stand up on my own and walk.\u201d\n\n               L.W. testified that she did not remember anything between Kramer-\n\nKelly and Guzi helping her to the car and waking up the next morning \u201cin their bed.\n\nI was in the middle, and they were on either side of me. I was half dressed. I believe\n\nthey were the same.\u201d L.W. testified that, when she woke up, she had no \u201csense\u201d of\n\nwhat happened to her the prior night. According to L.W., Guzi drove her home.\n\nL.W. testified as follows about what happened when she got home: \u201cI just remember\n\ngoing in my room and calling [Dinallo]. Telling him, I think something bad\n\nhappened to me. He came over, and I started crying. I could feel how much pain I\n\nwas in. And then I told my mom the same thing, and she told me to go to the\n\nhospital.\u201d\n\n               Asked about the pain, L.W. testified as follows: \u201cI mean, there was\n\nthrobbing in my vagina that I\u2019ve never felt before. My stomach hurt. I felt bruised.\n\nI just felt weak. My whole body hurt.\u201d L.W. also testified that she had \u201canal\u201d pain.\n\nL.W. testified that she was \u201chorrified\u201d at the idea of going to the hospital, \u201c[t]o think\n\nabout having to get a rape kit and be undressed in front of strangers.\u201d             The\n\nprosecutor asked L.W., \u201c[W]hat is that process like, having a rape kit performed?\u201d\n\nL.W. answered as follows: \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying. You\u2019re almost like you\u2019re getting violated\n\fagain. Having to be naked in front of strangers and having them take pictures all\n\nover your body. It was \u2014 it was horrible.\u201d\n\n                According to L.W., she reported the incident to the police within a\n\n\u201cday or two.\u201d\n\n                Prior to going to the hospital, L.W. messaged Kramer-Kelly via\n\nInstagram, and the following exchange took place:\n\n      L.W.: I need you to tell me everything that happened the other night.\n      And also, do you have any idea where my phone could be?\n\n      Kramer-Kelly: I have no clue where your phone is I don\u2019t remember\n      you even having it when we left the pickle\n\n      L.W.: Okay. Do you know when we left the pickle? And what happened\n      at [Guzi\u2019s]?\n\n      Kramer-Kelly: We left around like 1 and nothing happened at [Guzi\u2019s]\n      besides us getting you inside so you could go to sleep.\n\n                L.W. testified that she had seen pictures of Kramer-Kelly prior to the\n\nnight in question, because he followed her on Instagram.\n\n                Asked to describe \u201cwhat this process has been like sticking with this\n\nfor three plus years now,\u201d L.W. answered as follows:\n\n      There\u2019s been multiple times that I debated giving up. Getting into this\n      position, having to talk to a bunch of strangers about, you know, just\n      the worst thing that ever happened to me, it\u2019s horrifying. And knowing\n      that these people were living in the same city as me this entire time is\n      horrifying. Having to sit in front of the grand jury and feel like you\u2019re\n      the one who did something wrong and having them ask you questions\n      over and over and over again about something that you\u2019re trying so\n      hard to forget is hard. God. So I\u2019m doing some, a lot of therapy, and\n      I\u2019m truly just trying to put this behind me.\n\f                On cross-examination, L.W. testified that from approximately\n\nmidnight on October 5, 2018, to 8:30 or 9:00 a.m. on October 6, 2018, she was\n\nblacked out and does not remember anything. According to L.W., she contacted the\n\npolice on October 7, 2018, although she did not remember if she reported that her\n\nphone was missing and she was sexually assaulted or if she reported only that her\n\nphone was missing. L.W. met with Detective Grimm of the Brecksville police\n\ndepartment on October 8, 2018.\n\n       D. Nicole Rivera\n\n                Nicole Rivera (\u201cRivera\u201d) testified that she is a forensic scientist in the\n\nforensic biology and DNA division of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.\n\nRivera made DNA comparisons and generated a report based on evidence collected\n\nfrom L.W.\u2019s rape kit. The evidence tested included L.W.\u2019s bra and underwear, the\n\nswabs from L.W.\u2019s rape kit, and known DNA standards from Dinallo, Guzi, and\n\nKramer-Kelly.\n\n                L.W.\u2019s vaginal and anal swabs contained DNA from \u201cat least two\n\nadditional individuals\u201d other than L.W., and \u201cat least a portion of that additional\n\ndata did contain male DNA.\u201d These swabs were \u201cpresumptive\u201d for semen. Rivera\n\ntestified that \u201cpresumptive * * * indicates that a bodily fluid could be present. It\n\ndoesn\u2019t confirm that it is, in fact, that body fluid.\u201d\n\n                Rivera testified that she was \u201cable to exclude * * * Dinallo, * * * Guzi,\n\nand * * * Kramer-Kelly from the portion of that sample that I was able to make\n\ncomparisons to.\u201d Specifically, Rivera testified as follows:\n\fThat portion of the DNA profile is either too low of quality or quantity\nfor me to make any comparisons to, and that includes the number. I\ncan \u2014 because of that quality or quantity it\u2019s hard to conclude\ndefinitively, but there is evidence of at least two additional individuals.\n\nQ: Okay. And we talked a little bit about some of that DNA that you\njust \u2014 there\u2019s just not enough there to make an identification, and\nthat\u2019s what this additional DNA is, right?\n\nA: That\u2019s correct.\n\n***\n\nI can tell that there is at least male DNA present, which would indicate\nthat at least one of those individuals is a male. As far as the second\ncontributor, or the other contributor that\u2019s there, I couldn\u2019t make any\nconclusions. All I can say is that there is indication of male DNA.\nHowever, that portion of the DNA profile is unattributable.\n\n***\n\nQ: Now, I just want to clarify. It\u2019s a little confusing here where it says\n\u2014 and we\u2019ll start at the bottom \u2014 \u201c* * * Kramer-Kelly excluded from\ninterpretable data.\u201d And it makes it seem like there\u2019s no possible\nchance his DNA could have been in that vaginal swab. Is that true?\n\nA: There is only a portion of the sample I was able to make comparisons\nto, that being the major portion of the contributor that was contributing\nmore DNA than the others. To that portion I was able to include [L.W.].\n\nAnd I am making exclusions similarly on that portion, and then that\nadditional DNA, as I said, I couldn\u2019t make any comparisons to any\nindividual.\n\nQ: So \u2014 and I know we can\u2019t say definitively here \u2014 but could, could\nthat male DNA you see in there, could that be * * * Kramer-Kelly\u2019s\nDNA?\n\nA: Yes. It can potentially be any individual.\n\nQ: It could be anybody. It could be any male DNA?\n\nA: Any. So the additional data, like I said, it is from more than one\nother individual. There\u2019s at least two. So it could be male or female.\nBut of a male portion specifically, yes, it could be.\n\f       Q: You\u2019re just not \u2014 you just can\u2019t read it well enough to tell us if it\u2019s\n       * * * Kramer-Kelly\u2019s or not?\n\n       A: It could be any individual, yes.\n\n       Q: Right.\n\n       A: Kramer-Kelly or another is not where I can make a comparison.\n\n       Q: Fair enough. Thank you.\n\n               Rivera testified as follows about L.W.\u2019s oral swab: \u201cThe oral samples\n\nwere again found to be positive for * * * the presumptive presence of semen.\n\nHowever, it was \u2014 the DNA results were that the sample contained no DNA profile\n\nforeign to [L.W.].\u201d Rivera explained that this \u201cessentially means that the sample was\n\nfrom one contributor, that contributor being [L.W.], and there was no evidence of\n\nany foreign DNA profile to her.\u201d Asked if \u201cthings like brushing your teeth, drinking,\n\nwashing your mouth out, all of those things contribute to a lack of any foreign DNA,\u201d\n\nRivera answered, \u201cIt can, yes.\u201d\n\n               Rivera tested a swab from the crotch area of L.W.\u2019s underwear from\n\nher rape kit and found a DNA \u201cmixture,\u201d which was \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d for\n\nsemen. According to Rivera, she \u201cwas able to include * * * Kramer-Kelly as to the\n\nmajor portion of the sperm fraction. He was included \u2014 because he was included I\n\nprovided the statistic that indicates how common or how rare that profile is. For\n\nthis DNA profile the statistic is rarer than 1 in 1 trillion.\u201d\n\n               Guzi was included \u201cas a possible contributor to the major portion of\n\nthe non-sperm fraction\u201d of a swab of the back panel of L.W.\u2019s underwear, with a\n\nstatistic of \u201c1 in 2 billion.\u201d Kramer-Kelly and Dinallo were \u201cexcluded from the\n\fportion of the sample\u201d that Rivera was able to make comparisons to. Rivera further\n\nexplained:\n\n       It \u2014 because I was able to include a male, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t indicate\n       whether or not that additional data originates from a male or a female.\n       In the case where I indicate that it includes a male, that is because I was\n       only able to include a female. So the male marker that we look for is\n       either present or not present. In this case, I was unable to do that.\n\n                Rivera further tested a swab from L.W.\u2019s buttocks and concluded that\n\nthis swab was negative for semen. According to Rivera, the \u201csample was found to be\n\na mixture.\u201d However, without any further explanation, she \u201cwas able to include * * *\n\nKramer-Kelly as a possible contributor to the major portion of the sperm fraction,\u201d\n\nwith a statistic of \u201cgreater than 1 in 1 trillion.\u201d\n\n       E.

Seminal matter from \u201ca single source of male\n\norigin\u201d was identified in the vaginal and anal swabs. Frantz compared the DNA from\n\nthe seminal matter to known DNA standards from Kramer-Kelly and Guzi.\n\nAccording to Frantz, a \u201cmatch was identified between the sperm fraction\u201d of the\n\nvaginal swab and Kramer-Kelly, meaning that \u201cit is 57.2 octillion times more\n\nprobable tha[t] Kramer-Kelly has contributed to this profile versus any other person\n\nin the population.\u201d Kramer-Kelly\u2019s DNA was also identified in the sperm fraction of\n\nS.S.\u2019s anal swab, as well as a swab from a \u201cdried stain\u201d on S.S.\u2019s neck.\n\f      F.

He said, by the way, if you need to\n       know, my name\u2019s Brian. And I * * * exited the room.\n\n                  S.S.\u2019s boss picked S.S. up outside of the hotel.

She did, and according to Kramer-Kelly, L.W. and Guzi started\n\n\u201cfooling around,\u201d and he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d they had sex in the backseat.\n\n               At some point close to 2:00 a.m., Kramer-Kelly, L.W., and Guzi drove\n\nback to the Pickle to look for L.W.\u2019s cell phone. They did not find it, and Kramer-\n\nKelly tried again to drive L.W. home.\n\n               Kramer-Kelly told Det. Grimm that L.W. was so intoxicated that,\n\nwhile he was driving her home, she directed him to the wrong house. Ultimately,\n\nL.W. told Kramer-Kelly that she did not know where her house was. Kramer-Kelly\n\fdrove L.W. and Guzi to Guzi\u2019s house. All three of them got into Guzi\u2019s bed. Guzi fell\n\nasleep, and L.W. began talking to Kramer-Kelly and \u201ccrawling up on\u201d him.\n\nAccording to Kramer-Kelly, L.W. had been \u201ctrying this all night\u201d and he could \u201ccare\n\nless to have sex with [her].\u201d Kramer-Kelly told Det. Grimm that he told L.W., \u201cunless\n\nyou say you want to or yes, I\u2019m not taking that risk.\u201d\n\n              Kramer-Kelly told Det. Grimm that L.W. offered, and he \u201cdid receive\n\noral sex from her.\u201d The three of them slept from approximately 4:30 a.m. to 8:30 or\n\n9:00 a.m., when Kramer-Kelly and Guzi drove L.W. home. L.W. thanked them for\n\ngetting her home safely, and he has not seen or talked to her since then. When Det.\n\nGrimm asked more about whether he had any communication with L.W., Kramer-\n\nKelly stated that she messaged him about her lost phone the next Tuesday. He\n\nmessaged her back that he did not know where her phone was.\n\nIII.   Law and Analysis\n\n              On appeal, Kramer-Kelly assigns six errors for our review. We begin\n\nand end our analysis with the sixth assignment of error, because it is dispositive of\n\nthis case. In his sixth assignment of error, Kramer-Kelly argues that \u201cthe trial court\n\nabused its discretion in denying [his] motion for relief from prejudicial joinder.\u201d We\n\nnote that this court renders no opinion as to the merits of Kramer-Kelly\u2019s remaining\n\nassignments of error.\n\n       A. Joinder/Severance\n\n              Pursuant to Crim.R. 8(A), \u201c[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in\n\nthe same indictment, * * * if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar\n\fcharacter or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more\n\nacts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme\n\nor plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has\n\nheld that \u201c[j]oinder of offenses is favored because it conserves resources by avoiding\n\nduplication inherent in multiple trials and minimizes the possibility of incongruous\n\nresults that can occur in successive trials before different juries.\u201d State v. Hamblin,\n\n37 Ohio St.3d 153, 157-158, 524 N.E.2d 476 (1988).\n\n               However, pursuant to Crim.R. 14, \u201c[i]f it appears that a defendant\n\n* * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * in an indictment * * * the court shall\n\norder * * * separate trial[s] of [the] counts * * *.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has held\n\nthat the defendant \u201cbears the burden of proving prejudice and of proving that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion in denying severance.\u201d State v. Brinkley, 105 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 29. The state can refute a defendant\u2019s\n\nclaim of prejudice in one of two ways: \u201c(1) a showing that the evidence of each crime\n\nis simple and direct or (2) evidence of the other crimes would be admissible even if\n\nthe counts were severed.\u201d State v. Williams, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108275, 2020-\n\nOhio-269, \u00b6 79. \u201cA defendant is therefore not prejudiced by joinder when simple\n\nand direct evidence exists, regardless of the admissibility of evidence of other crimes\n\nunder Evid.R. 404(B).\u201d State v. Peterson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 100897 and\n\n100899, 2015-Ohio-1013, \u00b6 66.\n\n               This court reviews a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to sever under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. See State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 63, 600 N.E.2d\n\f661 (1992) (\u201c[T]he court abused its discretion in refusing to sever [the offenses],\n\nparticularly when its reasons for doing so were based on the fact that committing\n\none of these crimes shows a propensity to commit another \u2014 an inference that a jury\n\nis forbidden to draw.\u201d).\n\n               In the case at hand, Kramer-Kelly argues that the charges against him\n\nshould not have been set forth in a single indictment in violation of Crim.R. 8(A),\n\nand, in the alternative, he argues that he was prejudiced by the single indictment in\n\nviolation of Crim.R. 14. In both of these arguments, Kramer-Kelly\u2019s position is that\n\nthe charges concerning L.W. should have been tried separately from the charges\n\nconcerning S.S.\n\n               First, we analyze whether the offenses relating to L.W. \u201cmay be\n\ncharged in the same indictment\u201d as the offenses relating to S.S. under Crim.R. 8(A).\n\nThe charges relating to L.W. and the charges relating to S.S. are of the \u201csame or\n\nsimilar character,\u201d because Kramer-Kelly was charged with rape and kidnapping\n\nconcerning both victims. Upon review, we find that these offenses could be charged\n\nin the same indictment under Crim.R. 8(A). See, e.g., State v. Zoubaier, 9th Dist.\n\nSummit No. 26049, 2012-Ohio-2888, \u00b6 10 (finding that carrying a concealed\n\nweapon and having a weapon while under disability charges in two different\n\nincidents on two different dates could be tried together under Crim.R. 8(A) because\n\n\u201c[n]ot only are they crimes [of] a \u2018similar character,\u2019 they are the same crime[s]\u201d).\n\n               Turning to Crim.R. 14, if joinder is proper, a defendant may request\n\nrelief by showing prejudice. In the case at hand, Kramer-Kelly argued in the trial\n\fcourt that he was prejudiced by allowing the offenses concerning L.W. to be tried in\n\nthe same case as the offenses concerning S.S. for several reasons. First, it forced\n\n\u201chim to present separate or even inconsistent defenses.\u201d Specifically, that he was\n\nunaware of L.W.\u2019s substantial impairment and that the sexual encounter with S.S.\n\nwas consensual. Second, it restricted his ability to testify in L.W.\u2019s case but not in\n\nS.S.\u2019s case. Third, a jury may \u201capply or accumulate\u201d evidence from L.W.\u2019s case to\n\nevidence from S.S.\u2019s case.     Fourth, the evidence from either case would be\n\ninadmissible in the other case as \u201cbad character\u201d or \u201cpropensity\u201d evidence in\n\nviolation of Evid.R. 404(B), and this will have \u201ca negative impact upon the jurors\u2019\n\nfeeling about him.\u201d Fifth, L.W.\u2019s case was ready to go to trial before the state\n\nreindicted him with both cases, and he had to prepare for trial twice. Sixth, there is\n\nthe likelihood of two trials even if the court were to deny severance, because Guzi,\n\nas a codefendant, \u201cwill undoubtedly seek a separate trial.\u201d\n\n              Upon review, we find that Kramer-Kelly was prejudiced by the single\n\nindictment for the third and fourth reasons he sets forth in this appeal. We analyze\n\nthis prejudice below.\n\n              Next, if a defendant shows prejudice, the state may rebut this in one\n\nof two ways: showing that the evidence is simple and direct or showing that \u201cother-\n\nacts\u201d evidence would be admissible even if the offenses were severed. We start by\n\nanalyzing whether evidence from one trial would be admissible at the other trial\n\nunder Evid.R. 404(B) if the offenses were severed.\n\f              1. Inadmissible Other-Acts Evidence under Evid.R. 404(B)\n\n                Pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B)(1), \u201c[e]vidence of any other crime, wrong\n\nor act is not admissible to prove the person\u2019s character in order to show that on a\n\nparticular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d\n\n       \u201cA hallmark of the American criminal justice system is the principle\n       that proof that the accused committed a crime other than the one for\n       which he is on trial is not admissible when its sole purpose is to show\n       the accused\u2019s propensity or inclination to commit crime.\u201d State v.\n       Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 68, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975), citing 1 Underhill\u2019s\n       Criminal Evidence, Section 205, at 595 (6th Ed.1973). That philosophy\n       is premised on our understanding of human nature: the typical juror is\n       prone to \u201cmuch more readily believe that a person is guilty of the crime\n       charged if it is proved to his satisfaction that the defendant has\n       committed a similar crime.\u201d State v. Hector, 19 Ohio St.2d 167, 174-\n       175, 249 N.E.2d 912 (1969).\n\nState v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, \u00b6 20.\n\n                Although Hartman concerns other-acts evidence outside the joinder\n\nand severance arena, the offenses at issue in Hartman are similar to the offenses at\n\nissue in the case at hand. Furthermore, both Hartman and the instant case concern\n\nsexual assault allegations against two different victims, at two different times, and\n\nat two different locations.\n\n       Hartman was accused of raping an adult female acquaintance in her\n       hotel room after they had spent the evening out with a group of friends.\n       He claimed that the hotel encounter was consensual. To counter his\n       claim and support its version of events, the state presented \u201cother acts\u201d\n       evidence that Hartman had sexually abused his stepdaughter when she\n       was a child. A jury found Hartman guilty of the crimes, but the court\n       of appeals reversed, concluding that the other-acts evidence should not\n       have been admitted. We agree and affirm the judgment of the court of\n       appeals.\n\nId. at \u00b6 1.\n\f              The Hartman Court explained that, although \u201cother acts\u201d evidence is\n\ngenerally inadmissible, it may be admitted \u201cfor another purpose, such as proving\n\nmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of\n\nmistake, or lack of accident.\u201d Evid.R. 404(B)(2). The court analyzed each of these\n\napplicable exceptions and found that evidence that Hartman committed a prior\n\nsexual abuse \u201cis precisely the propensity inference that 404(B) forbids\u201d in a\n\nsubsequent sexual abuse case. Hartman at \u00b6 63.\n\n              Applying the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Hartman to the case\n\nat hand, we find that, had there been separate trials for the offenses concerning L.W.\n\nand the offenses concerning S.S., evidence from one trial would be inadmissible at\n\nthe other trial. Hartman makes clear that \u201cother-acts evidence must be probative\n\nof a \u2018purpose other than the person\u2019s character or propensity to behave in a certain\n\nway\u2019\u201d to be admissible. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d\n\n651, at \u00b6 26, quoting United States v. Gomez, 763 F.3d 845, 860 (7th Cir.2014).\n\n\u201cEvid.R. 404(B) provides a nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity\n\npurposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.\u201d Hartman at \u00b6 26.\n\n              In the state\u2019s \u201cresponse to motion to sever,\u201d filed in the trial court, it\n\nargues that the other-acts evidence at issue is admissible to \u201cdemonstrate that there\n\nis a common scheme, plan, or system, and a lack of mistake or accident.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the state argues that \u201cKramer-Kelly was carousing at a bar, beguiled a\n\nvictim who was intoxicated, left the establishment with that victim for a more\n\fsecluded or private location, and then sexually assaulted each victim when their\n\nability to resist was substantially impaired due to their intoxication.\u201d\n\n               The Hartman Court rejected a substantially similar argument,\n\nholding that evidence regarding Hartman sexually abusing his stepdaughter while\n\nshe was sleeping was not admissible in a trial alleging that Hartman sexually abused\n\nan acquaintance while she was sleeping. \u201cThat both crimes were committed against\n\na female sleeping in a bed is hardly unique to Hartman as a perpetrator.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 38.\n\n               As to the common scheme or plan argument, Hartman noted that\n\n\u201cplan evidence need not share any common characteristics with the current crime;\n\nrather, the other acts are linked to the present crime because they are carried out in\n\nfurtherance of the same overall plan.\u201d Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-\n\n4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, at \u00b6 40. The court explained that\n\n      [c]ommon-plan evidence generally concerns events that are\n      \u201cinextricably related\u201d to the crime charged. [State v.] Curry, 43 Ohio\n      St.2d at 73, 330 N.E.2d 720. The other acts form the \u201cimmediate\n      background\u201d of the present crime: they are typically either part of the\n      \u201csame transaction\u201d as the crime for which the defendant is on trial or\n      they are part of \u201ca sequence of events\u201d leading up to the commission of\n      the crime in question.\n\n(Citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 41. The court concluded that \u201cHartman\u2019s alleged assault\n\nof his stepdaughter was not part of a larger scheme involving the rape of\u201d the second\n\nvictim. Id. at \u00b6 43. The court \u201cstressed\u201d that \u201cplan evidence should show that the\n\ncrime being charged and the other acts are part of the same grand design by the\n\ndefendant.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 46.\n\f              Upon review, we find that the evidence concerning L.W. is not part of\n\na \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d that includes the evidence concerning S.S. These two\n\nincidents are not \u201cinextricably related\u201d nor are they part of the \u201csame transaction.\u201d\n\nKramer-Kelly and Guzi were accused of raping L.W. while she was substantially\n\nimpaired. Kramer-Kelly alone was accused of forcefully raping S.S. and raping her\n\nwhile she was substantially impaired. The rapes occurred nine months apart in\n\ndifferent cities. Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s attempt to introduce other-acts\n\nevidence and rebut Kramer-Kelly\u2019s showing of prejudice under a \u201ccommon scheme\n\nor plan\u201d theory.\n\n              Turning to the Evid.R. 404(B) exception concerning absence of\n\nmistake, the Hartman Court likewise rejected arguments substantially similar to the\n\narguments the state makes in the instant case. The court explained this exception\n\nas follows: \u201cOther-acts evidence is admissible to negate a defendant\u2019s claim of\n\nmistake or accident with respect to the commission of the alleged crime; such\n\nevidence tends \u2018[t]o show, by similar acts or incidents, that the act in question was\n\nnot performed inadvertently, accidentally, involuntarily, or without guilty\n\nknowledge.\u2019\u201d Id. at \u00b6 52, quoting McCormick, Evidence, Section 190, at 804 (4th\n\nEd.1994).\n\n              In Hartman, the \u201cstate offered the evidence for purposes of rebutting\n\nHartman\u2019s suggestion that even if [the second victim] did not consent to oral sex, he\n\nmistakenly thought that she had.\u201d Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440,\n\n161 N.E.3d 651, at \u00b6 54. \u201cOr to put it another way, the other-acts evidence \u2018must be\n\fso related to the crime charged in time or circumstances that evidence of the other\n\nacts is significantly useful in showing the defendant\u2019s intent in connection with the\n\ncrime charged.\u2019\u201d Id. at \u00b6 58, quoting 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence at Section 4:31.\n\n\u201cIn essence, the state\u2019s theory is that because Hartman had previously abused his\n\nstepdaughter, it is unlikely that he had consensual sex with\u201d the second victim. Id.\n\nat \u00b6 59.\n\n              The Hartman Court concluded that evidence that Hartman sexually\n\nabused his stepdaughter \u201cdoes not support an inference that Hartman entered [the\n\nsecond victim\u2019s] hotel room with the intent to rape her while she was intoxicated.\u201d\n\nId. at \u00b6 62. The court further concluded that the state\u2019s argument that Hartman\n\n\u201cpreys on sleeping or impaired women * * * is precisely the propensity inference that\n\nEvid.R. 404(B) forbids.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 63.\n\n              We again find that the reasoning in Hartman applies to the case at\n\nhand. The other-acts evidence at issue \u2014 the admissibility of allegations concerning\n\none victim at a trial concerning another victim \u2014 would be inadmissible under a\n\nmistake or accident theory. We conclude that this constituted improper propensity\n\nevidence under Evid.R. 404(B), and prejudiced Kramer-Kelly under Crim.R. 14 at\n\ntrial.\n\n           2. The Evidence is Not Simple and Direct\n\n              We now turn to whether the evidence in this case was simple and\n\ndirect under Crim.R. 14. Ohio courts have held that evidence is simple and direct \u201cif\n\nthe jury is capable of readily separating the proof required for each offense, if the\n\fevidence is unlikely to confuse jurors, if the evidence is straightforward, and if there\n\nis little danger that the jury would \u2018improperly consider testimony on one offense as\n\ncorroborative of the other.\u2019\u201d (Internal citations omitted.) State v. Wright, 4th Dist.\n\nJackson No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-8702, \u00b6 52. See also State v. Palmer-Tesema, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 107972, 2020-Ohio-907.\n\n               Notwithstanding part of the evidence concerning S.S. in the case at\n\nhand, Kramer-Kelly\u2019s trial was complex, confusing, and inherently inconsistent.\n\n               There is inconsistent testimony about whether L.W. was substantially\n\nimpaired that night. L.W. provided no testimony about the allegations of sexual\n\nassault. Rather, she testified that she had no recollection about the events that\n\noccurred after she left the Pickle. See State v. Doss, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88443,\n\n2008-Ohio-449, \u00b6 21 (The victim\u2019s \u201ctestimony that she does not remember anything\n\nabout the incident is not evidence that she did not consent to the sexual encounter\n\nor that appellant knew that she may have been substantially impaired.\u201d). Rivera\u2019s\n\ntestimony about the DNA she extracted and tested from L.W.\u2019s rape kit is not simple\n\nand direct and, at best, can be described as inconclusive. Robinson\u2019s testimony\n\nabout the medical records from L.W.\u2019s rape kit established that L.W. may have been\n\nsexually assaulted, but there is inconclusive and inconsistent evidence about\n\nwhether the alleged assailant was Kramer-Kelly,2 Guzi, or \u201cany other\u201d unidentified\n\nmale.\n\n\n\n        2Kramer-Kelly admitted to Det. Grimm that he received oral sex from L.W. that\nnight, although his DNA was not found on L.W.\u2019s oral swab. The evidence from L.W.\u2019s\n\f               Additionally, the state presented the evidence in a nonlinear fashion,\n\nfirst introducing testimony concerning L.W., next introducing testimony concerning\n\nS.S., and then returning to testimony concerning L.W. While we are acutely aware\n\nthat the presentation of witnesses is not always perfect and is generally considered\n\ntrial strategy, our review of the trial transcript shows that the state gave no roadmap\n\nto the jury separating the testimony regarding L.W. from the testimony regarding\n\nS.S. Compare State v. Lewis, 6th Dist. Lucas Nos. L-09-1224 and L-09-1225, 2010-\n\nOhio-4202, \u00b6 33 (\u201cOhio appellate courts routinely find no prejudicial joinder where\n\nthe evidence is presented in an orderly fashion as to the separate offenses or victims\n\nwithout significant overlap or conflation of proof.\u201d). In point of fact, this court had\n\na difficult time piecing together who was testifying about whom.\n\n               The witnesses and evidence regarding L.W.\u2019s case are not the same\n\nwitnesses and evidence concerning S.S.\u2019s case. This weighs against trying these\n\ncases together from a judicial economy perspective. Lyndhurst v. Smith, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 101019, 2015-Ohio-2512, \u00b6 29, quoting Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 58,\n\n600 N.E.2d 661 (\u201cJoinder of offenses solely because they are of the same or similar\n\ncharacter creates a greater risk of prejudice to the defendant, while the benefits from\n\nconsolidation are reduced because \u2018unrelated offenses normally involve different\n\ntimes, separate locations, and distinct sets of witnesses and victims.\u2019\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nvaginal and anal swabs showed the presence of presumptive seminal fluid, but no DNA\nmatch was made.\n\f              Upon review, we find that the bootstrapping effect of the evidence in\n\nS.S.\u2019s case onto L.W.\u2019s case, which permitted the jury to simultaneously consider the\n\nevidence in both alleged rape cases, prejudiced Kramer-Kelly at trial. See State v.\n\nMeeks, 2015-Ohio-1527, 34 N.E.3d 382, \u00b6 125 (5th Dist.) (Hoffman, J., concurring)\n\n(When \u201cthe charges include sexual allegations * * * the possibility jurors may\n\nbootstrap the evidentiary strength of one charge to support a guilty verdict on\n\nanother charge where the evidence is less persuasive is both real and substantial.\u201d).\n\nWe further find that the state did not refute this showing of prejudice, because the\n\nevidence presented was disorderly, inherently inconsistent, and had a high risk of\n\nconfusing the jury. Additionally, had the trials been severed, evidence concerning\n\nL.W. would have been inadmissible at S.S.\u2019s trial, and evidence concerning S.S.\n\nwould have been inadmissible at L.W.\u2019s trial.\n\n              Accordingly, Kramer-Kelly\u2019s sixth assignment of error is sustained.\n\nHis   remaining   assignments     of   error    are   rendered   moot   pursuant    to\n\nApp.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n\n              Judgment reversed, convictions and sentence vacated, and case\n\nremanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      It is ordered that appellant recover from appellee costs herein taxed.\n\n      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\f      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nLISA B.
