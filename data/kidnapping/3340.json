Because the jury was not instructed that it must consider Belmontes\u2019 principal mitigation evidence, which tended to show that he would adapt well to prison and would likely become a constructive member of society if incarcerated for life without possibility of parole, and because there is a reasonable probability that the instructional error affected the jury\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty on Belmontes, we grant the petition with respect to the penalty phase. We reject, however, those claims that seek relief from the judgment of conviction and the finding of special circumstances. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions to issue a writ vacating the death sentence.\nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA. The Crime, Its Investigation, and Pretrial Proceedings\n\nOn the morning of Sunday, March 15, 1981, 19-year-old Steacy McConnell telephoned her parents and stated that she was afraid because several people, including codefendant Domingo Vasquez, had threatened her. Several hours later, McConnell\u2019s parents arrived at her residence in Victor, California, and found her lying unconscious in a pool of blood. She died shortly thereafter from cerebral hemorrhaging caused by fifteen to twenty blows to her head with an iron bar. Her skull was cracked, and she had defensive injuries on her hands, arms, and feet. The house was ransacked and her stereo was missing.\nOn the Tuesday preceding the murder, several people, including Vasquez and another codefendant, Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Bola-nos, partied at McConnell\u2019s house. Although Bolanos left the residence early Wednesday morning, the party continued until Friday, when Vasquez stole a quantity of \u201cblack beauties\u201d \u2014 amphetamine pills \u2014 from McConnell. Upon discovering the theft, McConnell threw Vasquez and his friends out of the house. The group subsequently discussed their dislike of McConnell.\nPolice investigation of the individuals who had been present at the party extended to Vasquez, and ultimately to Bolanos, who drove a distinctive black Chevy. The police recognized Bolanos\u2019 car as matching the description of the car that had been seen in McConnell\u2019s driveway at the time of the murder. The police impounded the car and interrogated Bolanos. Bolanos eventually admitted that he had been involved in the events that led to McConnell\u2019s death; he identified Vasquez and Petitioner Fernando Belmontes, Jr., who had not been at the party but who had been visiting him over the weekend of the murder, as his coadventurers. On the strength of Bolanos\u2019 statement, the police obtained a warrant and headed South to Ontario, where they arrested Belmontes at his brother\u2019s home. Belmontes was nineteen at the time.\nBelmontes, Bolanos, and Vasquez were each charged with first degree murder and special circumstances. However, Bolanos soon arranged a deal with the prosecution in which he agreed to testify against Vasquez and Belmontes in exchange for a guilty plea to second degree burglary and immunity on the murder charge. At Vasquez\u2019s preliminary hearing, Bolanos fingered Belmontes as the main assailant. After the preliminary hearing, the trial judge dismissed the special circumstances charge against Vasquez, and he pled guilty to second degree murder. That left Bel-montes, who alone proceeded to trial.\n\n*1033\nB. The Quilt Phase\n\nBolanos was the principal witness for the state. He testified that on the morning of Sunday, March 15, he and Bel-montes drove to Vasquez\u2019s residence to hang out. When they arrived, Vasquez was on the phone with McConnell. When Vasquez hung up the phone, he informed them that McConnell would not be home during the latter part of the day. The three were short of cash, and they agreed to burglarize McConnell\u2019s residence, steal her stereo, and \u201cclean house.\u201d Vasquez\u2019s wife, Karrie Lynn, testified that as the men departed through the kitchen, Bel-montes grabbed from the counter an iron dumbbell bar, which she used for rolling tortillas.\nBolanos told the jury that the three men drove to McConnell\u2019s house in Bolanos\u2019 vintage, black car and parked a short distance from the house. According to Bola-nos, Belmontes stated that he would approach the house alone, on foot, carrying the metal bar in case he needed to force entry, so that he could gather McConnell\u2019s valuables and place them near the door to facilitate a quick getaway, and that the other two should wait for about five minutes and then bring the car around to McConnell\u2019s house.\nBolanos testified that the events unfolded as follows: Belmontes left his wristwatch with him, concealed the bar under his jacket, and walked to McConell\u2019s residence. Bolanos and Vasquez waited about five minutes, then drove up and backed into McConnell\u2019s driveway. Vasquez tried to open the trunk but could not find the right key. Bolanos got out of the vehicle to assist Vasquez. He heard repeated knocking or banging noises coming from within the house. Bolanos unlocked the trunk and got back inside the car, while Vasquez walked to the front door to assist Belmontes. Shortly thereafter, Belmontes and Vasquez emerged from the back door of the house carrying stereo components. Belmontes was sprinkled with blood on his face, pants, and shoes. Vasquez \u201clooked like he had seen a ghost.\u201d Belmontes stated that he had had to \u201ctake out a witness\u201d because she was home. He explained that when McConnell heard Vasquez and- Bolanos drive up, she looked away from him and he seized the opportunity to hit her with the bar approximately fifteen times.\nLucy Flores, McConnell\u2019s neighbor, testified that on the morning of the murder she watched Bolanos\u2019 Chevy as it backed into McConnell\u2019s driveway. She observed a man get out of the passenger side and try to unlock the trunk. He appeared to be having difficulty, whereupon the driver got out of the car and unlocked it. The driver got back in the car, while the passenger walked towards the front of McConnell\u2019s house and met a third man. She did not see where the third man had come from. The two men headed toward the front of McConnell\u2019s house. A short while later, she saw them exit McConnell\u2019s house from the back door, carrying stereo equipment, which they loaded in the trunk before getting in the car and driving away.\nBolanos testified that, after leaving McConnell\u2019s ^house, the three drove to the nearby city of Galt, where they intended to fence the stereo. En route, Belmontes wiped blood from the metal bar and his shoes. Belmontes threw the bar out of the window as they crossed a bridge over the Mokelumne river.1 They went to the home of Manuel Vasquez, Domingo\u2019s *1034brother, where Belmontes changed his pants. The three contacted Raul Barron, who met them at the home of Irma Vasquez, Domingo\u2019s sister, and purchased McConnell\u2019s stereo components from them. Barron later testified that he paid $100 for the stereo to a man wearing a baseball cap (Belmontes), who did most of the talking.\nTeresa Cobarrubio, Bolanos\u2019 girlfriend, testified that Bolanos gave her fifteen dollars from the proceeds of the sale of the stereo. Acting scared, he informed her that he, Belmontes, and Vasquez had burglarized McConnell\u2019s residence. The following day, Bolanos and Cobarrubio read a newspaper account of McConnell\u2019s murder, and Bolanos related further details of the crime. He told Cobarrubio that he had remained in the car, and that Belmontes had exited the house with blood on his clothes and had stated that he \u201chad to take a witness out.\u201d\nBolanos testified that on Monday, March 16, Vasquez called him to advise that he had been questioned by police and did not want to \u201ctake the rap\u201d for the murder. Bolanos and Belmontes went to Vasquez\u2019s house, where the three conferred. Karrie Lynn Vasquez testified that from the kitchen she overheard Belmontes say that he entered McConnell\u2019s house alone and hit her multiple times with the bar before Vasquez joined him in the house.\nBarbara Murillo, Belmontes\u2019 girlfriend, testified that after the meeting, Belmontes telephoned her and told her that he was \u201cin trouble.\u201d He reported that he had gotten into an argument with McConnell at her house, become angry and hit her, and that she fell and \u201cwent to sleep,\u201d although he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean for her to go to sleep.\u201d\nDetective Holman, the lead investigator, testified that Belmontes furnished three tape-recorded statements shortly after his arrest. In the first statement, he denied any involvement in the crime. In the second, he admitted the burglary but denied hitting McConnell. In the third statement, he admitted hitting McConnell, but insisted that he only hit her once, and then only at Vasquez\u2019s direction. He stated that the single blow he delivered caused McConnell to fall down, whereupon he dropped the bar and began searching the house for valuables, leaving Vasquez alone with McConnell. Belmontes contended that he did not pay attention to Vasquez\u2019s actions during this period and did not observe how McConnell came to have suffered fifteen to twenty fatal blows to her head. Holman also testified that a small drop of blood found on the tongue of one of Belmontes\u2019 shoes tested as \u201ctype 0\u201d\u2014 McConnell\u2019s blood type.\nDr. Maduros, the pathologist who performed the autopsy on McConnell, testified that she died from cerebral hemorrhaging caused by fifteen to twenty blows to the back left portion of her skull. She had a separate contusion on her right temple, which was caused by a single blow of lesser force that did not lacerate the skin. However, this blow alone would not have caused death and, if it had been the first, it would not likely have caused unconsciousness. Injuries to McConnell\u2019s arms, hands, legs, and feet evidenced a struggle. According to Dr. Maduros, there would have been sounds \u201clike a cracked pot\u201d associated with the blows that fractured McConnell\u2019s skull, and blood would have splattered in a manner consistent with the blood patterns found on the door jambs in her house.\nBelmontes testified in his own defense. He insisted that Vasquez dealt the fatal blows while he, Belmontes, searched the back part of the house for something to take. Belmontes recounted that he and Bolanos had gone over to Vasquez\u2019s house, *1035and that when Vasquez mentioned that McConnell would not be home, they decided to steal her stereo. Although they expected McConnell to be away, the plan was that Belmontes would go to the door in case she turned out to be home; because of the unhappy denouement of her party a few days earlier, McConnell would become angry and suspicious if she saw Vasquez or Bolanos at her door. Although Belmontes had met McConnell a few times in the past, she did not know that he was a friend of Vasquez and Bolanos.\nBelmontes\u2019 version of events was consistent with Bolanos\u2019 up to the point of who struck the blows that killed McConnell. Belmontes agreed that Vasquez and Bola-nos stayed in the car while he walked to McConnell\u2019s front door. He stated that Vasquez had given him the metal bar to use to break a window; but that he concealed it in his sleeve. According to Bel-montes, he knocked at McConell\u2019s door and, to his surprise, she answered. As soon as he found out that she was home, he abandoned his intent to burglarize her residence. He told her that he was hitchhiking and had stopped by because it was raining. McConnell invited him in. She noticed a bulge in his sleeve and asked what it was. He showed her the bar and explained that he had it because he was hitchhiking. He used McConnell\u2019s bathroom and then stood by the table and talked to her while she ironed clothes. McConnell told him that she was having problems with some people and asked him if he knew Domingo Vasquez. Belmontes said that he had met him.\nBelmontes\u2019 testimony continued: Five minutes after he entered the house, Bola-nos and Vasquez pulled into the driveway. McConnell started walking toward the front door. Belmontes followed behind her and was placing the bar back up his sleeve when Vasquez rapped on the door. Under Belmontes\u2019 version, when Bolanos\u2019 car backed into- the driveway, Vasquez would have had to proceed immediately to the front door; he would not have had time to go to the trunk of the car to attempt to open it.\nAccording to Belmontes, after he knocked at the door to McConnell\u2019s house, Vasquez pushed it open, saw McConnell, and ordered Belmontes to \u201chit her.\u201d Bel-montes followed Vasquez\u2019 directive and, using a backhanded sweeping motion, struck McConnell on the side of her head with the bar. She fell to the floor. Bel-montes dropped the bar, ran to the back bedroom, broke down the door, searched that room and the kitchen, and returned to the living room. He did not enter the master bedroom. Upon returning to the front of the house, he observed Vasquez standing over McConnell and holding the metal bar. He did not see Vasquez hit McConnell or hear any blows landing because he was not paying attention. He could not explain the presence of defensive bruises and contusions on McConnell\u2019s hands, arms, and feet.\nThe rest of Belmontes\u2019 testimony is, with one significant exception, consistent with Bolanos\u2019: Belmontes and Vasquez gathered the stereo components and exited from McConnell\u2019s back door. They loaded the stereo components into the trunk. Vasquez got in the back seat, Belmontes rode shotgun, and Bolanos drove. According to Belmontes, while en route, Vasquez handed him the steel bar, which had flesh and hair residue on it, and then Vasquez (not Belmontes) stated that he had had to take out a witness. Belmontes, still wearing his gloves, wiped blood off the bar and set it down on the floorboard. He was uncertain whether there was blood on his pants when he left McConnell\u2019s house; he said that the blood might have come off the bar when he placed it on the floor*1036board. He denied having wiped any blood off of his shoes and asserted that Bolanos and Vasquez told him to throw the bar out his window into the river, and that he complied.\nBelmontes concluded his testimony by stating that the three drove to Manuel Vasquez\u2019 house, where he changed into a pair of Manuel\u2019s pants. Manuel contacted Raul Barron, whom they then met at Irma Vasquez\u2019 house. Barron bought the stereo for $100. Bolanos, Vasquez and Bel-montes divided the money, bought some beer, and drove to the home of an acquaintance to purchase narcotics.\nBelmontes\u2019 girlfriend, Barbara Murillo, testified that six months after the murder, she ran into Cobarrubio at the Grape Festival. Murillo believed that Belmontes was the murderer. However, when she asked Cobarrubio for further details about the crime, Cobarrubio claimed that Belmontes had been \u201cset up\u201d because he had no backup in the area, whereas Vasquez had a network of local friends.2\nAfter three hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Belmontes of first degree murder with special circumstances. It also made special findings that Belmontes was the actual killer and that he had the specific intent that death occur.\n\nC. The Penalty Phase\n\nAt the penalty phase, the prosecution introduced minimal aggravating evidence. Detective Holman authenticated two autopsy photographs depicting McConnell\u2019s wounds. William Cartwright, manager of a motel in Ontario, California, testified to an incident in early 1979 in which an individual named Rudy met Belmontes at a motel and attempted to sell him a .32 caliber automatic handgun that he had acquired in a burglary. Belmontes reportedly examined the loaded weapon, cocked the trigger, pointed it at Rudy and stated, \u201cI\u2019ve got it now. Why buy it?\u201d Rudy left the premises and Belmontes retained the weapon.\nSteven Cartwright testified that he had a conversation with Belmontes in February 1979 in which Belmontes alluded to the fact that some people were upset with him. As Belmontes talked, he indicated that he had a gun in his belt by slapping his side, and he stated that he was not concerned because he had all the protection he needed. Ron Cutler, a California Youth Authority (\u201cCYA\u201d) counselor, testified that he once observed Belmontes swinging a chair as if he were about to hit another ward, but Cutler was able to intervene before a fight ensued. On cross examination, he admitted that Belmontes was significantly smaller than the other youth.\nBarbara Murillo testified about a domestic violence incident that occurred when she asked Belmontes to move out of their shared apartment and to give her his keys so he could not come back. During the fight that ensued, Murillo, who was four months pregnant with Belmontes\u2019 second child, grabbed a \u201cfile\u201d for protection and attempted to phone the police, but Bel-montes cut the telephone cord with his knife. Belmontes pushed her and hit her on the head, at one point causing her to drop their infant daughter. He tried to choke her, but they were separated by friends who were present. Murillo fled through a window, but Belmontes dragged her back to the vicinity of the apartment. *1037A neighbor eventually summoned the police, who arrived as Belmontes was leaving the premises.\nFinally, the prosecution and defense stipulated that Belmontes entered a plea of no contest in April 1979 to a charge of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter. The court refused to allow the prosecutor to introduce evidence that Belmontes had actually murdered the victim, Jerry Howard.3 Consequently, the jury never heard any details of the murder or Belmontes\u2019 alleged role in it.\nBelmontes\u2019 mitigation presentation was also limited in scope, focusing on two themes: his family and personal history and his capacity for rehabilitation and positive institutional adjustment. It was primarily the latter theme that defense counsel pressed upon the jury.\nBelmontes\u2019 family history was one of poverty and violence. His maternal grandfather, Michael Salvaggio, testified to his daughter\u2019s unhappy marriage to Bel-montes\u2019 father. Salvaggio recounted that his daughter was sixteen when she ran away from home and married Belmontes\u2019 father, who was unemployed, refused to support his family, drank to excess, and beat her. Salvaggio said that he was \u201cvery close\u201d to his grandson until Bel-montes was about thirteen but after that had little contact with him. However, Sal-vaggio continued, when Belmontes was sixteen and his grandmother lay dying in the hospital, he visited her every day; he also attended her funeral.\nCarol Belmontes confirmed that her marriage to Belmontes\u2019 father was unhappy. Fernando Belmontes, Sr., was a violent alcoholic who \u201cwouldn\u2019t ever work,\u201d and who beat her, breaking her arm on one occasion and stabbing her on another. Belmontes was ten years old when the marriage broke up. Mrs. Belmontes remarried. That marriage broke up five years later, when Belmontes was about fifteen, after which he became difficult to control. Belmontes had not lived with his mother since he was committed to the CYA two years before McConnell\u2019s murder. He had a younger brother and sister, to whom he was \u201cvery close.\u201d\nBelmontes again testified on his own behalf. He recounted that he had a poor relationship with his father, who often came home drunk and hit his mother. He did not like school and stopped attending in the ninth grade. He wanted to get a job so that he could help his mother pay the bills. Although he described his youth as \u201cpretty hard,\u201d he twice stressed that he did not want to \u201cuse it as a crutch.\u201d\nRobert Martinez, a close friend of Bel-montes since their early teens, testified that he and Belmontes spent a great deal of time together, usually working on Martinez\u2019s low-rider car. Belmontes served as best man at Martinez\u2019s wedding and was someone he could turn to for advice and support when he argued with his wife. Martinez also testified that he felt Bel-montes was not a violent person. However, with defense counsel\u2019s consent, this testimony was struck following an objection from the prosecutor, who argued that if this evidence was admitted, the prosecution should be allowed to impeach Martinez with the evidence regarding the Jerry Howard murder.\nMore important by far was the second mitigation theme \u2014 that Belmontes could lead a positive, constructive life if confined *1038within an institutional setting. The state agrees that Belmontes\u2019 counsel, John Schick, presented \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in support of this theme in the form of a series of witnesses who testified to Bel-montes\u2019 behavior and achievements during his prior CYA incarceration and to the likelihood that he would make positive contributions to the welfare of others if his life was spared. Belmontes himself testified that he was in the custody of the Youth Authority from early 1979 until November 1980, four months prior to the crime. While at the CYA, he was employed on the fire crew at the Pine Grove Camp for one year, during which he worked his way up from last man to number two, a position of leadership and responsibility. Belmontes also testified that during his incarceration he became involved in the M-2 Christian sponsorship program. He admitted that he initially entered the M-2 program as a way to get out of camp, but he explained that he was touched by the decency of his M-2 family, the Haros, and so gradually became curious about Christianity and embraced it.\nBelmontes continued by saying that he was paroled from the Youth Authority after serving his maximum sentence; that he stayed at the halfway house in Oakland for two weeks and then went to Southern California for a short period, returning with Murillo to the Lodi area to take a job with the forest service; and that he subsequently moved to Lodi in part so that he could be close to the Haros. However, outside of the institution, Belmontes said, he had trouble maintaining his religious commitment and \u201cstarted going back to [his] old ways,\u201d in part due to \u201cpressure on the streets.\u201d At the time of trial, he had not abandoned his religious beliefs but felt that he was no longer \u201cdedicated one hundred percent\u201d to his religious commitment. He testified that he would hope to make positive contributions to society if he were ordered incarcerated, though he had little specific idea of how he might do so.\nThe Reverend Dale Barrett, chaplain at the Youth Authority\u2019s Pine Grove Facility, testified that he knew Belmontes from his participation in the M-2 Christian sponsorship program, which matched a local church-going family with a ward, who would be permitted to leave the facility to visit with the family at specified times each week. Barrett explained that Belmontes was matched with Beverly and Fred Haro and participated in the program for about a year. In addition, Belmontes was baptized during his stay in the CYA. Only a small percentage of program participants who made a serious commitment to Christianity were baptized. Barrett felt that, unlike the many wards who stayed in the program only to get out of camp and manipulate favors from the sponsoring families, Belmontes had not \u201cconned\u201d them. Barrett testified that although he personally believed in the death penalty, he did not think Belmontes deserved to die because he was a \u201csalvageable\u201d person with \u201ca lot of extenuating circumstances in his life.\u201d Barrett was of the view that Bel-montes\u2019 involvement in the McConnell murder was attributable to \u201cthe enormity of the peer pressure and the kind of sociological circumstances that were part of his life,\u201d and he thought that if Belmontes were granted a life sentence, he would make positive contributions to prison life through his involvement with the prison ministries.\nDon Miller, assistant chaplain at the Youth Authority\u2019s Preston Facility and the Northern California Director of the M-2 program, testified that he helped place Belmontes in a halfway house in Oakland upon his release from the CYA. Miller stated that, at the time, he felt \u201ca little bit doubtful\u201d about Belmontes\u2019 ability to lead a productive life outside of a highly struc*1039tured environment, like prison. Miller testified that Belmontes stayed at the halfway house for only two weeks before moving to the Lodi area to take a job with the forest service. During those two weeks, however, Belmontes returned to Preston on a few occasions to speak to wards about what life was like \u201con the outside.\u201d Miller described Belmontes (and his message) as well-received by the CYA wards, and he believed that if Belmontes were committed to prison for a life term, he would be good at counseling other prisoners not to make the same mistakes that he had. Miller was enthusiastic about working with Bel-montes in this capacity and stated that Belmontes \u201cdefinitely would be used in the prison system for this kind of activity\u201d because he related well to other prisoners, especially those who shared his ethnic background, and because these kinds of programs were \u201cat the present time the only solution\u201d to the troubling problem of recidivism among prisoners.\nFinally, several witnesses offered evidence with respect to Belmontes\u2019 conversion to Christianity, which occurred during his first CYA incarceration, and his failure to maintain his religious commitment upon his release. Martinez\u2019s wife Darlene, a born-again Christian, testified that she had known Belmontes for six or seven years and considered him a close friend. Darlene recounted that when Belmontes visited them after his release from the Youth Authority, he told her that he was a born-again Christian. He also mentioned his disputatious relationship with his girlfriend, Murillo, and mentioned that he was planning to move in with her. During the conversation, Belmontes expressed concern that Murillo was not a Christian, and he worried that he would be unable to maintain his Christian faith on his own.\nBeverly and Fred Haro, Belmontes\u2019 M-2 sponsors and members of Reverend Barrett\u2019s church, testified that Belmontes spent Wednesday evenings and weekends with them for almost a year. They felt they had a good relationship with Bel-montes, who attended church with them. They treated him like their own son, and he opened up to them and was a good influence on their own teenage son. They saw him several times after his release from the CYA. Fred Haro stated that he had \u201ccompassion as a son\u201d for Belmontes and that Belmontes had been genuine in his commitment to the M-2 program and his affection for his sponsors. Beverly Haro felt that Barbara Murillo was a \u201cdefinite negative factor\u201d in Belmontes\u2019 life.\nAt the conclusion of the evidentiary stage, the court permitted Belmontes to address the jury personally during closing arguments. Belmontes stated that he did not think that his difficult childhood excused his role in the McConnell murder. However, he explained that he could not handle the pressures of life outside of an institution, and he asked the jury to give him \u201can opportunity to achieve goals and try to better [himjself.\u201d Belmontes\u2019 attorney similarly stressed that Belmontes could not \u201cmake it on the outside.\u201d He argued that Belmontes had had a hard life but still retained his humanity. He characterized Belmontes as someone who thrived in a structured environment \u2014 as evidenced by his accomplishments while in the CYA \u2014 and asked the jury to spare Belmontes\u2019 life- on the ground that he would make positive contributions if allowed to live out his natural life in prison.\nThe judge instructed the jury according to the then-standard model jury instructions, which directed the jury to consider as mitigating evidence the defendant\u2019s age, criminal history, and \u201c[ajny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\u201d In addition, the judge read *1040a portion of a supplemental instruction requested by the defense, which stated that the jury should view the statutory factors \u201cmerely as examples of some of the factors\u201d that it could consider, that the jury \u201cshould pay careful attention to each of these factors,\u201d and that \u201cany one of them standing alone\u201d could support a life sentence. The trial judge refused to read the most important part of the requested instruction, which stated: \u201c[Y]ou should not limit your consideration of mitigating circumstances to these specific factors. You may also consider any other circumstances ... as reasons for not imposing the death sentence.\u201d The jury was not informed that it should consider mitigating evidence bearing on Belmontes\u2019 probable future conduct if sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Shortly after Belmontes\u2019 trial, the California legislature revised the model jury instructions to make clear that the jury must consider any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record offered as a basis for a sentence less than death, \u201cwhether or not related to the offense for which he is on trial.\u201d CALJIC 8.85(k) (6th ed.1996).\nThe jury deliberated for a day and a half before reaching a verdict. On the first day, after several hours of deliberations, the jury sent the judge a note asking, \u201cWhat happens if we cannot reach a verdict?\u201d and \u201cCan the majority rule on life imprisonment?\u201d The jury was brought back to the courtroom, and the judge reread a portion of the jury instructions, emphasizing that \u201call 12 jurors must agree, if you can.\u201d The trial judge refused to tell the jurors what would happen if they could not agree.\nThe trial judge emphasized that if the jurors \u201c[went] over the instructions again with one another,\u201d they might find it easier to reach agreement. The jurors then asked the judge to clarify the instructions on the weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors. One juror asked the trial judge whether the jury was supposed to take each listed (i.e., statutory) factor, decide whether it was aggravating or mitigating, and then \u201cbalance the sheet.\u201d Rather than instruct the jurors that it was their duty to consider and, if appropriate, give effect to, all of the mitigating evidence presented by the defendant, whether comprehended by one of the statutory factors or not, the trial judge responded simply, \u201cThat is right,\u201d even though no statutory factor comprehended the element of rehabilitation. Shortly thereafter, another juror asked whether it was possible for Bel-montes to receive psychiatric treatment while in prison. The trial judge responded, \u201cThat is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\u201d Following this colloquy, the jury returned a death sentence.\n\nD. Post-Trial\n\nThe California Supreme Court affirmed Belmontes\u2019 conviction and sentence in 1988, People v. Belmontes, 45 Cal.3d 744, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310 (1988), and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in early 1989. Belmontes then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, which was held in abeyance while Belmontes exhausted state remedies.\nBelmontes filed a state habeas petition and received a stay of execution from the California Supreme Court. The California courts summarily dismissed Belmontes\u2019 petition, refusing him compulsory process and denying him an evidentiary hearing on any of his claims. The California Supreme Court finally denied relief in 1992.\nIn 1993, proceedings on the federal writ commenced before a magistrate judge. In 1996, he denied Belmontes\u2019 request for an *1041evidentiary hearing on certain claims but granted his motion to expand the record to include depositions, declarations, and reports submitted by the parties. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In 2000, the district court withdrew the referral from the magistrate judge and, in August of that year, denied relief on all claims except six that had not yet been briefed. The court referred those six claims to the magistrate judge for a recommendation. In January 2001, the magistrate judge recommended denying the out-standing claims, and in May 2001, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations, denied the petition, and entered judgment against Belmontes. The district court issued a Certificate of Appealability for fifteen constitutional claims. This appeal timely followed.\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nBecause Belmontes filed his habeas petition prior to AEDPA\u2019s effective date, we apply pre-AEDPA standards of review. Woodford v. Garceau, \u2014 U.S. -, -, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 1401, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003). State court factual findings are presumed correct unless one of eight enumerated exceptions applies. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1994). The application of law to historical facts is reviewed de novo. Thompson v. Borg, 74 F.3d 1571, 1573 (9th Cir.1996).\nIII. GUILT PHASE ISSUES\nA. Giglio and Napue Claims\nBelmontes alleges that the state deprived him of due process by faffing to disclose that Bolanos had several misdemeanor charges and that the prosecutor personally helped him achieve favorable dispositions on those charges. In a closely related claim, he contends that the prosecutor violated due process by faffing to correct Bolanos\u2019 false and misleading testimony that he had never been \u201cbusted\u201d before his arrest for the McConnell murder.\n\n1. Factual Background\n\nOn the Wednesday morning before the murder, Bolanos drove into a traffic signal on his way home from McConnell\u2019s house. A police officer witnessed the accident. After flunking a field sobriety test, Bola-nos was taken into custody and charged with various misdemeanor driving offenses, including DUI and hit-and-run.\nOne week later, Bolanos was charged with first degree murder for his role in the McConnell murder. He soon entered into an agreement in which he pled guilty to second-degree burglary in exchange for testifying against Vasquez and Belmontes. He was granted immunity for his testimony and his sentence was left to the court\u2019s discretion. He received no explicit promises of leniency from the prosecution.\nAfter Bolanos pled guilty to the burglary, he obtained a string of unusually favorable dispositions on several traffic offenses. First, with respect to the DUI/hit- and-run charges, his attorney appeared in municipal court along with Clark Sueyres, the district attorney who was prosecuting the case against Belmontes. On Sueyres\u2019 motion, the charges were dismissed in the interest of justice. Next, later that year, Bolanos was cited for driving an unregistered vehicle and driving with a suspended license. He was allowed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of driving without a valid license and assessed a $100 fine; the court dismissed the unregistered vehicle charge. The following April, Bolanos was again cited for driving an unregistered vehicle, driving with a suspended license, operating an unsafe vehicle, and driving with worn tires. Again, Sueyres personally asked *1042the municipal court to dismiss the charges in the interest of justice. Bolanos, once again, pled guilty to driving without a valid license and paid a $75 fine. None of these matters was disclosed to the defense.\nAt trial, Bolanos admitted on cross-examination that he was testifying under court order in exchange for a grant of immunity and that he would face a murder charge if he refused to testify. However, Schick\u2019s efforts to impeach Bolanos were hampered by the fact that Bolanos continually minimized both his own culpability and the benefits he received from the prosecution in exchange for his testimony. For example, Bolanos told the jury that his motive in testifying was \u201cto tell the truth,\u201d and he stated that because he \u201cwasn\u2019t even around when the crime happened,\u201d he did not view the grant of immunity as a particular favor.\nIn addition, Bolanos was less than truthful when he testified about his prior contacts with law enforcement. When Schick questioned Bolanos about prior inconsistent statements that Bolanos had made to the police, Bolanos explained them by saying that he had made mistakes out of nervousness because it was \u201cthe first time I got busted.\u201d In fact, Bolanos had been \u201cbusted\u201d twice before. In addition to the DUI/hit-and-run incident, Bolanos had previously been arrested for gun possession by Detective Holman, the same officer who arrested him for the McConnell murder. The arrest generated formal criminal charges, and Bolanos was sentenced to thirty days in a juvenile facility, of which he served fifteen.\n2. Giglio Claim\nThe prosecution has an affirmative duty to turn over to the defense all evidence favorable to the accused, including impeachment evidence. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 432, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). The failure to disclose favorable evidence violates due process when the evidence is material. United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); Singh v. Prunty, 142 F.3d 1157, 1161 (9th Cir. 1998). .Evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had it been disclosed to the defense, the outcome of the trial would have been different. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375. A reasonable probability occurs when the suppression \u201cundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBelmontes argues that the prosecutor violated due process by failing to turn over material impeachment evidence consisting of the existence and unusual disposition of Bolanos\u2019 misdemeanor traffic offenses. The state responds that the prosecutor had no duty to disclose this evidence because the misdemeanor violations were not mentioned in the plea agreement and were not dismissed as consideration for Bolanos\u2019 testimony against Belmontes. In support of this argument, the state cites the deposition testimony of both Bolanos and his attorney to the effect that they did not perceive the dismissal of the traffic offenses as related to the immunity deal.\nThe state\u2019s argument is without merit. We have held that when the state relies on the testimony of a criminal informant, it has an obligation to disclose \u201call information bearing on that witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d including \u201cthe witness\u2019s criminal record ... and any information therein which bears on credibility.\u201d Carriger v. Stewart, 132 F.3d 463, 480 (9th Cir.1997). We further emphasized the importance of this rule in Benn v. Lambert, in which we *1043held that \u201cthe state cannot satisfy its Brady obligation to disclose exculpatory and impeachment evidence by making some evidence available and asserting that the rest would be cumulative. Rather, the state is obligated to disclose all material information casting a shadow on a government witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d 283 F.3d 1040, 1057-58 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the fact that the prosecutor personally appeared in municipal court to argue for favorable dispositions of Bolanos\u2019 misdemeanor traffic offenses casts a shadow on Bolanos\u2019 credibility regardless of whether such intervention was mentioned in the plea agreement or offered as consideration for Bolanos\u2019 testimony. Had defense counsel known about the existence and disposition of the misdemeanor offenses, he could have impeached Bolanos by showing that he had a motive to say what the prosecution wanted to hear in hopes of obtaining a lighter sentence on his plea to second degree burglary. Even though Bolanos was not explicitly promised leniency, the fact that the prosecutor helped Bolanos obtain dismissals or reduced punishments on his traffic misdemeanors makes it more likely that he would intercede on Bolanos\u2019 behalf when it came time for sentencing on the burglary charge. Thus, the evidence was clearly relevant and admissible for purposes of impeachment, and the district attorney should have disclosed it.\nNevertheless, we hold that Belmontes\u2019 Giglio claim fails because, under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, the undisclosed evidence was not material. This case presents different circumstances from those in Benn, in which we held that the prosecutor\u2019s dispensation of similar favors on behalf of his star witness \u2014 including quashing a traffic ticket, dismissing a burglary charge, and postponing the filing of an arrest warrant until after Benn\u2019s trial \u2014 were material benefits. Id. In Benn, we held that the failure to disclose these benefits necessitated a new trial, even though the prosecutor disclosed that he had made a deal with the informant to seek a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony against Benn, and defense counsel impeached the informant on this point. Id.\nAside from the fact that the undisclosed benefits in Benn may well have been more substantial than those at issue here, Benn is distinguishable for three reasons. First, Bolanos was actually involved in the McConnell murder, whereas the informant in Benn was a jailhouse snitch. Evidence that a jailhouse snitch received material benefits from the prosecution is especially important because without that evidence the informant masquerades as a disinterested observer. See United States v. Bernal-Obeso, 989 F.2d 331, 333-34 (9th Cir. 1993) (describing practice of relying on criminal informants as \u201cfraught with peril\u201d). In this case, however, Bolanos was cross-examined extensively as to his role in the crime and the details of his immunity agreement, so the jury could not possibly have viewed him as disinterested. Second, the impeachment evidence that was disclosed in Benn was relatively trivial; although the informant received sentencing leniency in his unrelated case, the leniency saved him only thirty-five days of jail time. Benn, 283 F.3d at 1057. Accordingly, \u201cthe number and nature of the undisclosed benefits was such that they would have impeached [the witness] more effectively\u201d than the benefits that were disclosed. Id. at 1058. By contrast, in the present case the impeachment evidence that was disclosed was substantial: an agreement allowing Bolanos to plead guilty to second-degree burglary and receive immunity for the murder in exchange for his testimony. Finally, in Benn the prosecutor effectively *1044downplayed the importance of the impeachment evidence in his closing argument. Id. (quoting prosecutor\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]he reward he got was that in a 6 to 12 month sentence, he got six months instead of nine months. Big reward.\u201d). In this case, however, the prosecutor argued that the jury should view Bolanos\u2019 testimony critically, and the jury was so instructed. For these reasons, we conclude that Benn does not control our analysis here.\nHere, the undisclosed benefits were not material because there is not a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if defense counsel had known about them. In making this judgment, we realize that Belmontes need not pass a sufficiency of the evidence test. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555. \u201cHowever, our fundamental concern remains whether there exists a reasonable probability that given disclosure of the evidence of benefits to[the witness], one or more members of the jury would have viewed[his] testimony in a different light.\u201d Singh, 142 F.3d at 1163. In this case, Bolanos was impeached with his immunity agreement, including the fact that the charges filed against him were substantially lower than the evidence would have warranted. The withheld evidence would not have added much, if anything. Moreover, Bolanos\u2019 testimony was corroborated by that of several other witnesses, including disinterested witnesses like Lucy Flores and Barbara Murillo, who were not involved in the crime or related to the codefendants. Belmontes\u2019 testimony to the contrary was uncorroborated and did not hold up well under cross-examination. Had Bolanos\u2019 testimony been less well-supported or the undisclosed benefits been greater, or had the prosecutor not urged and the judge not instructed the jury to view his testimony with suspicion, we might conceivably have reached a different conclusion. Nevertheless, given the extent of the corroborating evidence, the relative unimportance of the undisclosed benefits as compared to those that were disclosed, and the nature of the prosecutor\u2019s statement, we cannot say that the jury would have viewed Bolanos\u2019 testimony in a different light had it known that the prosecutor had helped him to quash his misdemeanor traffic offenses or obtain lighter punishment on them. In short, the undisclosed benefits do not undermine our confidence in the verdict. In these circumstances, we hold that the withheld evidence was not material, and the claim must, therefore, be denied.\n3. Napue Claim\nBelmontes also argues that the prosecution violated his due process rights by failing to correct Bolanos\u2019 false assertion that he had never been \u201cbusted\u201d before. The prosecutor has an independent, constitutional duty to correct testimony he knows to be false. Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269-70, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959); N. Mariana Islands v. Bowie, 243 F.3d 1109 (9th Cir.2001). If there is \u201cany reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury,\u201d the conviction must be set aside. United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).\nThe state argues that the prosecution had no duty to correct the record because defense counsel was notified of the drunk-driving arrest at a pretrial hearing. Whether defense counsel is aware of the falsity of the statement is beside the point. The state overlooks the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s duty to correct false testimony arises, not simply out of a duty of fairness to the defendant, but out of \u201cthe free standing constitutional duty of the State and its representatives to protect the sys*1045tem against false testimony.\u201d Bowie, 243 F.3d at 1118. Therefore, regardless of whether defense counsel should' have known that a state witness testified falsely, \u201c[a] prosecutor\u2019s \u2018responsibility and duty to correct what he knows to be false and elicit the truth,\u2019 Napue, 360 U.S. at 269-70, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217, requires [him] to act when put on notice of the real possibility of false testimony.\u201d Id.\nThe state also contends that the prosecution had no duty in this case because the word \u201cbusted\u201d is ambiguous, and therefore Bolanos may not have testified falsely at all. We do not find the word \u201cbusted\u201d to be ambiguous. See Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 189 (3d college ed.1988) (defining \u201cbust\u201d as \u201cto arrest\u201d). In this case, the prosecutor knew that Bolanos had been \u201cbusted\u201d twice before: once for DUI/ hit-and-run and once for gun possession. He had an independent duty to correct the false testimony and elicit the truth.\nIf there were any reasonable likelihood that Bolanos\u2019 false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury, we would be compelled to grant the petition with respect to this claim. Belmontes argues that a reasonable likelihood exists, pointing to the fact that the \u201cfirst time I got busted\u201d comment arose at a crucial part of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination. Bolanos used this false statement to explain his prior inconsistent statements on two critical points: the length of time Vasquez spent in the house and the alleged knocking noise that Bolanos heard when he got out of the car to open the trunk. He stated that he was nervous when he made the prior inconsistent statements to the officer because he had never been busted before. The testimony that was inconsistent was important because it tended to incriminate Belmontes and exculpate Vasquez by suggesting that McConnell was killed before Vasquez entered the house; it also was not directly corroborated by any other witness. Conceivably, if the jury knew that Bolanos had lied when trying to explain his prior inconsistent statements on these points, it could have concluded that Bolanos was lying about the timing and the knocking noise, either to please the prosecution or to protect Vasquez. The jury then would have been more likely to believe Belmontes\u2019 testimony that Vasquez was the actual killer.\nUltimately, however, we do not believe that Bolanos\u2019 false testimony regarding the absence of prior arrests could have affected the judgment of the jury. As we explained, his testimony regarding the events surrounding the murder was in most respects corroborated by independent witnesses. Furthermore, the most damaging testimony of the trial came from Belmontes himself. On cross-examination, Belmontes conceded that for his version of events to be true, Vasquez would have had to have come directly from the car to the door without attempting to open the trunk, and there is direct evidence to the contrary from a disinterested eyewitness. Moreover, Belmontes refused to say that he had seen or heard Vasquez hitting McConnell, and he could not explain how Vasquez would have had enough time to both murder McConnell and ransack the front bedroom. Finally, Belmontes, but not Vasquez, had blood sprinkled on his clothes and shoe. On this record, we hold that there is no reasonable likelihood that Bolanos\u2019 false testimony that his arrest in connection with the McConnell murder was \u201cthe first time I got busted\u201d would have affected the judgment of the jury. We therefore deny relief on this claim.\n\nB. Conflict of Interest\n\nBelmontes contends that he was deprived of due process and the effective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of *1046interest arising from Schick\u2019s multiple pri- or representations of Vasquez. See Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). At the heart of the claim is the allegation that Schick, because of the conflict of interest, did not offer evidence of Vasquez\u2019s violent criminal history in support of his defense theory that Vasquez was the actual killer.4 Belmontes argues that this evidence was relevant and admissible for two purposes: first, to show that Vasquez was, in fact, the actual killer; and second, to impeach B o\u00edanos\u2019 credibility by showing that his fear of retaliation by Vasquez caused him to place the blame on Belmontes, rather than on the true murderer.\n\n1. Factual Background\n\nDuring pretrial proceedings, Vasquez\u2019s attorney brought a motion to recuse Schick as counsel for Belmontes. The motion was based on the fact that Schick\u2019s law firm had represented Vasquez in a 1979 murder case; Vasquez\u2019s attorney feared that Schick had confidential information that he would use against Vasquez as part of his defense theory that Vasquez was the actual killer.5 Schick opposed the motion and filed a declaration in which he stated: (1) the attorney who represented Vasquez in 1979 had since left the firm; (2) the case against Vasquez was dismissed prior to trial; (3) he himself had acquired no confidential communications from Vasquez; and (4) the case file had been destroyed eight months earlier. The trial judge held a hearing and, based on these facts, denied the motion. The judge asked Belmontes if he wished to retain Schick as his lawyer, knowing that Schick\u2019s firm had previously represented Vasquez. Bel-montes said that he did.\nIn postconviction proceedings, Bel-montes\u2019 attorneys learned that Schick\u2019s connection to Vasquez was, in fact, much more extensive than he had disclosed to either Belmontes or the trial court. Prior to entering private practice, Schick and the members of his criminal defense firm had worked at the local public defenders\u2019 office. There, Schick and the members of his firm represented Vasquez on three occasions in addition to the 1979 murder charge. In August 1974, Schick had himself represented Vasquez on a gun possession charge; he had helped Vasquez negotiate a guilty plea. In November 1974, Patrick Riddle, a partner in Schick\u2019s law firm, had represented Vasquez on a rape charge.6 In January 1976, Douglas Jacob-sen, the third partner in Schick\u2019s firm, had represented Vasquez in a purse-snatching case that went to jury trial. Schick did not notify Belmontes or the court of these incidents of representation even though he remembered them at the time of the recu-sal motion.\n*1047In 1994, Schick signed another declaration with respect to the conflict of interest claim. In that declaration, he averred that at the time of the recusal motion, he saw no relationship between any of Vasquez\u2019s prior cases and the McConnell murder. He asserted that his representation of Bel-montes was not inhibited by his prior representation of Vasquez and that his loyalty to Belmontes was complete and undivided. Schick stated that he considered calling Vasquez as a witness and would have been prepared to cross-examine him fully had he taken the stand. However, he also admitted that he did not investigate Vasquez\u2019s violent criminal history even though doing so would have been helpful to Bel-montes\u2019 defense. Schick stated that he did not make a tactical decision not to pursue this investigation. He explained that his normal procedure is to investigate the criminal record of a potential witness; however, he did not consider Vasquez a potential witness until after he had entered a guilty plea.\nSchick testified at his deposition that he knew that he had a continuing duty of loyalty to Vasquez, but he did not view Belmontes\u2019 defense as conflicting with that duty in any way. However, Schick admitted that he knew that the district attorney could revive the 1979 murder charge against Vasquez at any time (although he also stated that it never crossed his mind that the prosecution would do so as a result of any evidence Schick presented at Belmontes\u2019 trial). In addition, Schick recognized that even though Vasquez entered his guilty plea prior to Belmontes\u2019 trial, Vasquez had an ongoing liberty interest in being viewed as an aider and abettor in the McConnell murder, and not the actual killer.\n\n2. Discussion\n\nAt the outset, we dispose of the state\u2019s procedural objections to the claim. The state first contends that the claim is unexhausted because Belmontes did not present to the California Supreme Court all of the facts underlying the claim. This argument fails because \u201cnew factual allegations do not render a claim unex-hausted unless they \u2018fundamentally alter the legal claim already considered by the state courts.\u2019 \u201d Chacon v. Wood, 36 F.3d 1459, 1468 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 260, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986)). Here, although the additional facts add some evidentiary support to the claim, they do not \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d it. See Weaver v. Thompson, 197 F.3d 359, 364 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that jury misconduct claim was properly exhausted when petitioner presented incidents of improper jury contact that differed in number, but not in kind, from what was presented to state courts). The essential factual and legal theories are the same as those presented to the California courts. Therefore, Belmontes adequately exhausted the claim.\nNext, the state argues that the claim is barred by the Teague nonretroactivity doctrine. See Teague v. Lane, 490 U.S. 1031, 109 S.Ct. 1771, 104 L.Ed.2d 206 (1989). The government bases this argument on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent statement that, as far as its own precedent is concerned, the question whether Cuyler extends to cases of successive representation is still open. Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1246, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002). However, we have held that circuit court holdings suffice to create a \u201cclearly established\u201d rule of law under Teague. Bell v. Hill, 190 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.1999). In this circuit, it was well-established at the time that Belmontes\u2019 conviction became final that conflicts of constitutional magnitude can arise from cases of successive representation. See, *1048e.g., Mannhalt v. Reed, 847 F.2d 576, 579 (1988); United States v. Wheat, 813 F.2d 1399, 1402 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir.1987), aff'd on other grounds, 486 U.S. 153, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). Accordingly, the conflict claim is not Teague-barred.\nWe also hold that Belmontes\u2019 purported waiver of the conflict of interest was invalid. \u201cFor a waiver to be knowing and intelligent, the defendant must have been sufficiently informed of the consequences of his choice.\u201d Lockhart v. Terhune, 250 F.3d 1223, 1232 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, Schick failed to inform Belmontes or the court of the extent of his prior relationship with Vasquez. In addition, neither Schick nor the trial judge explained to Belmontes that Schick owed a continuing duty of loyalty to Vasquez, a duty that could potentially conflict with Belmontes\u2019 defense theory \u2014 that Vasquez was McConnell\u2019s actual killer. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Belmontes was not sufficiently informed of the consequences of his choice, and his waiver was therefore invalid. See Lockhart, 250 F.3d at 1232-33, citing United States v. Curcio, 680 F.2d 881 (8th Cir.1982) (holding that waiver was ineffective when the defendant was informed of possible conflict due to attorney\u2019s prior representation of codefendant and told that conflict may arise from prior confidential communications, but not told that conflict may arise from attorney\u2019s continued loyalty to codefendant).\nTo establish a Sixth Amendment violation based on conflict of interest, the defendant must show that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 338, 100 S.Ct. 1708; Mannhalt, 847 F.2d at 579. Generally, it is more difficult to demonstrate an actual conflict resulting from successive, rather than simultaneous, representation. Mannhalt, 847 F.2d at 580. Conflicts of interest based on successive representation may arise if the current and former cases are substantially related, if the attorney reveals privileged communications of the former client, or if the attorney otherwise divides his loyalties. Id. Ultimately, however, an actual conflict of interest is one \u201cthat affected counsel\u2019s performance \u2014 as opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties.\u201d Mickens, 122 S.Ct. at 1243. In other words, the simple \u201cpossibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.\u201d Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708.\nWe must decide whether the potential conflict of interest engendered by Schick\u2019s prior representation of Vasquez ripened into an actual conflict. We begin by noting that there is no suggestion that Vasquez\u2019s prior cases were substantially related to the McConnell murder or that Schick was in possession of privileged communications from Vasquez. Therefore, if Belmontes is to demonstrate an actual conflict, he must show that Schick \u201cdividefd] his loyalties\u201d between Vasquez and Belmontes. Fitzpatrick v. McCormick, 869 F.2d 1247, 1252 (9th Cir.1989), citing Mannhalt, 847 F.2d at 580. In engaging in this inquiry, we look beyond Schick\u2019s protestations to the contrary to see whether independent evidence in the record supports the allegation of divided loyalties. United States v. Shwayder, 312 F.3d 1109, 1119 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cHuman self-perception regarding one\u2019s own motives for particular actions in difficult circumstances is too faulty to be relied upon, even if the individual reporting is telling the truth as he perceives it.\u201d); Sanders v. Ratelle, 21 F.3d 1446, 1452 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cThe existence of an actual conflict cannot be governed solely by the perceptions of the attorney; rather, the court itself must *1049examine the record to discern whether the attorney\u2019s behavior seems to have been influenced by the suggested conflict.\u201d).\nAfter a careful examination of the record, we find no evidence that Schick divided his loyalties between Vasquez and Belmontes. Indeed, Belmontes\u2019 entire defense was that Vasquez was the killer. This case is thus distinguishable from cases like Lockhart, Sanders, and Fitzpatrick, all of which addressed situations in which defense counsel sabotaged their current clients\u2019 case by refusing to raise the obvious defense that a former client was actually responsible for the murder. See Lockhart, 250 F.3d at 1230-31 (where the evidence showed that the same person had committed both an earlier murder and the murder for which defendant was on trial, defendant\u2019s trial counsel refused to present evidence that his former client had committed the earlier murder); Sanders, 21 F.3d at 1453 (defense counsel successively represented two brothers who were accused of the same murder; the first brother confessed his guilt to defense counsel, who advised him to take the Fifth at his brother\u2019s trial; at the trial, defense counsel put forth an unconvincing alibi defense rather than evidence that the first brother had committed the murder); Fitzpatrick, 869 F.2d at 1251-52 (defense counsel refused to present defense that a former client actually committed the murder; because of the prior attorney-client relationship, defense counsel believed in the former client\u2019s innocence to the detriment of his current client).\nBelmontes argues nevertheless that an actual conflict of interest affected Schick\u2019s performance at his trial. According to Belmontes, even though Schick argued that Vasquez was the killer, he failed to support this theory with hard evidence. Belmontes asserts that Schick should have investigated Vasquez\u2019s lengthy criminal record and presented it as evidence that Vasquez was the actual killer. He also asserts that Schick should have impeached Bolanos by showing that he was in fear for his life due to death threats issued by Vasquez and thus had a powerful motive to falsely shift the blame from Vasquez to Belmontes. Belmontes argues that the only possible explanation for these lapses on Schick\u2019s part is that he felt bound by a continuing duty of loyalty to Vasquez, and that this duty required him to refrain from presenting evidence that could have resulted in the revival of the 1979 murder prosecution or impaired Vasquez\u2019s prospects for an early parole on his second degree murder conviction in the current case.\nWe are of the view, however, that these alleged failings are too speculative to sustain a conflict of interest claim. This is not a case in which Schick failed to present evidence that went directly to Vasquez\u2019s\u2014 and therefore Belmontes\u2019 \u2014 guilt or innocence. Rather, Schick sought squarely to place the blame on Vasquez, and did not overlook any direct evidence on that point. He simply failed to investigate and present evidence of Vasquez\u2019s prior bad acts, which, if admissible, might have marginally affected whether a jury would have had a reasonable doubt as to Belmontes\u2019 guilt. Given the absence of evidence suggesting that Vasquez was the actual killer and given the damaging nature of Belmontes\u2019 own conflicting statements, any counsel might have failed to investigate and offer evidence regarding Vasquez\u2019s criminal history. In short, we hold that this failure, standing alone, is not enough to show that Schick divided his loyalties between Vasquez and Belmontes. It is not \u201clikely\u201d that a conflict caused Schick to handle Belmontes\u2019 case as he did. See United States v. Miskinis, 966 F.2d 1263, 1268 (9th Cir.1992). Thus, Belmontes has not shown that he was deprived of his Sixth *1050Amendment rights by an actual conflict of interest.\n\nC. Involuntary Statement\n\nBelmontes argues that the prosecutor violated his due process rights by introducing into evidence his involuntary, inculpa-tory statements. However, Belmontes testified in his deposition that he spoke to the police freely and voluntarily. There was no due process violation here.\n\nD. Counsel\u2019s Failure to Challenge Arrest Warrant\n\nBelmontes claims that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to challenge his arrest warrant. He argues that the warrant in his case was facially insufficient to support a finding of probable cause because nothing in the warrant corroborated the allegation that Bel-montes himself, as opposed to Bolanos, was involved in the crime.7\n1. Strickland Claim\nIn order to prevail on his ineffectiveness claim, Belmontes must show that: (1) his trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the results of the proceeding would have been different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To satisfy Strickland\u2019s prejudice prong in a Fourth Amendment context, Belmontes must demonstrate a reasonable probability that a motion to suppress would have succeeded and that the suppression of the warrant would have led to a different outcome at the trial. Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 375, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986). The reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance is evaluated from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the alleged error. See id. at 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574.\nAt the time of Belmontes\u2019 trial, the federal Aguilar-Spinelli test applied *1051to affidavits supporting warrant applications. Aguilar-Spinelli did not require independent corroboration of the facts set forth in the affidavit. Rather, under Aguilar-Spinelli, the affidavit on its face had to provide enough information so that a magistrate could determine: (1) that the informant was reliable (the \u201cveracity\u201d prong); and (2) that his information was dependable (the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong). Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964); United States v. Larkin, 510 F.2d 13, 15 (9th Cir.1974). Under federal law, the affidavit met both prongs. Because the affidavit stated that Bolanos acquired his information through first-hand observation, it satisfied the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong, Aguilar, 378 U.S. at 114, 84 S.Ct. 1509, and because it contained a statement against penal interest, it satisfied the veracity prong. United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 583-84, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971) (holding that, in most cases, statements against penal interest are inherently reliable); but see United States v. Hall, 113 F.3d 157, 159 (9th Cir.1997) (declining to apply Harris to accomplice informant because \u201conce a person believes that the police have sufficient evidence to convict him, his statement that another person is more important to his criminal enterprise than he gains little credibility from its inculpatory aspect\u201d).\nNor would the claim have had a reasonable probability of success under California law. According to the California Supreme Court, the affidavit contained sufficient corroboration to support a finding of probable cause:\nThe circumstances of the crime and evidence found at the crime scene \u2014 as summarized in the affidavit \u2014 corroborated Bolanos\u2019 statement.... [T]rial counsel could reasonably have concluded that the affidavit contained sufficient corroboration of Bolanos\u2019s hearsay statement; that the arrest warrant thus issued on probable cause; and that a de novo motion to quash the warrant would have proved futile.\nPeople v. Belmontes, 45 Cal.3d 744, 768, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310 (1988). We are bound by statements of the California Supreme Court as to California law. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385, (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habe-as court to reexamine state court determinations on state law questions.\u201d). Accordingly, we must conclude that Schick would not have had a reasonable probability of success in challenging the arrest warrant. Thus his failure to challenge the warrant does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n2. Franks Claim\nBelmontes also alleges that material omissions in the affidavit caused the magistrate to issue a warrant for which there was no probable cause. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Under Franks, if a criminal defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an officer recklessly omitted material information from the affidavit, and if the affidavit considered with the omitted evidence is insufficient to establish probable cause, then the \u201cwarrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking.\u201d Id.\nOn appeal, Belmontes did not specify what evidence was omitted from the warrant, but he did refer to the California Supreme Court opinion, which described four categories of evidence: (1) The affiant, a police officer, was familiar with Vasquez\u2019s violent history but did not *1052know Belmontes; (2) Bolanos\u2019s car had been identified at the scene of the crime; (3) Bolanos offered his statement only after his car was impounded and his girlfriend had incriminated him; and (4) at first, Bolanos bed when speaking to the police. Belmontes, 45 Cal.3d. at 769, 248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310. Three of these omitted facts cast aspersions on Bo-lanos\u2019 credibility because they highlight his strong motive to shift the blame for McConnell\u2019s death to someone else. The fourth is plainly of no relevance. As to the three, the face of the affidavit makes clear that Bolanos was Mirandized, which itself indicates that Bolanos was a suspect in the crime. The omitted details add more color to Belmontes\u2019 claims, but they do not change the basic calculus involved in determining Bolanos\u2019 reliability. Accordingly, they are not material, and the Franks claim must be denied.\nE. Doyle Claim\nBelmontes asserts that the prosecutor violated his due process rights by cross-examining him as to his post-arrest silence in violation of Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). However, the Supreme Court has held that Doyle does not apply to a defendant who has waived his Miranda rights and voluntarily given a statement to the police. Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S. 404, 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980). Belmontes testified in his deposition that he understood his Miranda rights, waived them, and spoke freely and voluntarily to the police. No Doyle error occurred.\n\nF. Unconstitutional Restriction on Cross-Examination\n\nBelmontes contends that the trial judge violated his Sixth Amendment rights by unconstitutionally restricting his cross-examination of Karrie Lynn Vasquez, Vasquez\u2019s wife. Ms. Vasquez testified that she saw Belmontes take the iron bar from the kitchen and heard him admit to killing McConnell. Defense counsel sought to impeach her testimony by demonstrating that she was lying in order to increase Vasquez\u2019s chances at an early parole by emphasizing Belmontes\u2019 greater culpability. This strategy was foiled because the trial judge refused to allow defense counsel to question Ms. Vasquez as to her knowledge of the length of Vasquez\u2019s sentence.\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine witnesses as to potential bias. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). However, the trial judge retains considerable latitude to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based on harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, and relevance. Id. Any error is subject to harmless error review. Id. at 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431.\nDespite the fact that the trial judge prevented defense counsel from exploring Ms. Vasquez\u2019s bias with respect to the length of Vasquez\u2019s sentence, defense counsel cross-examined her extensively and effectively. Defense counsel elicited testimony that Ms. Vasquez had known her husband for eight years, bore his child, stayed with him in spite of his frequent infidelity, married him while he was in prison for the McConnell murder, and visited him in jail every weekend. The jury thus had ample reason to believe that Ms. Vasquez was biased in favor of her husband. In addition, counsel forced Ms. Vasquez to admit that, although she had been questioned extensively during the police investigation, it was not until the day before Belmontes\u2019 trial that she first claimed to have heard him admit to the crime. This testimony strongly suggested that Ms. Vasquez was lying about what she *1053claimed to have heard. Ms. Vasquez could not have been impeached much more effectively.\nIn light of the extensive and effective cross-examination that occurred, and the minimal amount of additional force the excluded material would have added, the error, if any, could not have had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). Accordingly, we deny relief on this claim as well.\n\nG. Evidentiary Errors\n\nBelmontes argues that his trial was rendered fundamentally unfair by the introduction of hearsay and double-hearsay statements supporting Bolanos\u2019 testimony that Belmontes was the actual killer. However, the California Supreme Court held that these statements were properly admitted prior consistent statements. We are bound by the opinion of the California Supreme Court in these matters of state law. Estelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475. As the Court has stated, \u201cthe Due Process Clause does not permit the federal courts to engage in a finely tuned review of the wisdom of state evidentiary rules.\u201d Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 438 n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983). Here, the statements added little and did not render the trial fundamentally unfair.\n\nH. Instructional Error\n\nBelmontes also challenges an instruction directing the jury not to speculate as to why other individuals involved in the crime were not on trial along with Belmontes. He claims that this instruction prevented the jury from considering the impact of Bolanos\u2019 immunity agreement on his credibility. We must determine \u201cwhether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d Estelle, 502 U.S. at 72, 112 S.Ct. 475 (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that it did not, because the jury was also instructed that it should view Bolanos\u2019 testimony with suspicion due to his involvement in the crime. Accordingly, we deny this claim also.\n\nI. Fair Cross-Section\n\nBelmontes alleges that he was deprived of a jury comprised of a fair cross-section of the community because of the systematic exclusion of minority jurors from the venire. However, he provides no statistical data in support of his claim. Belmontes\u2019 claim is thus barred by our decision in Thomas v. Borg, 159 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir.1998). In that case, the petitioner argued that we should excuse his failure to provide the necessary statistical evidence because his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to preserve it. Id. at 1150. We held:\n[F]or purposes of our fair cross-section analysis, the reason for Thomas\u2019 lack of evidence is immaterial. Because Thomas has provided us with insufficient statistical evidence to determine whether blacks were substantially underrepresented on jury venires or panels in Kern County at the time of his trial, his Sixth Amendment fair cross-section claim must be denied.\nId. at 1150-51. Applying Thomas to the facts of this case, we must deny the claim.\n\nJ. Jury Misconduct\n\nBelmontes contends that the district court erred in denying him an eviden-tiary hearing on his juror misconduct claims. A habeas petitioner must meet two conditions to be entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing: He must (1) allege facts which, if proven, would entitle him to relief, and (2) show that he did not receive *1054a full and fair hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding. Id. at 1126-27. A petitioner who meets these conditions must receive a hearing. See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that because prisoner diligently pursued claim in state court, and was denied a hearing, he was entitled to a hearing in federal court); United States v. Navarro-Garcia, 926 F.2d 818, 822 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cUnless the court is able to determine without a hearing that the allegations are without credibility or that the allegations if true would not warrant a new trial, an eviden-tiary hearing must be held.\u201d).\nBelmontes first asserts that the jurors based their decision on the view that \u201clife without possibility of parole did not mean that Belmontes would spend the rest of his life in prison.\u201d Belmontes is not entitled to relief on this claim because it concerns intrinsic jury processes. \u201c[I]n-trinsic jury processes will not be examined on appeal and cannot support reversal.\u201d United States v. Bagnariol, 665 F.2d 877, 887 (9th Cir.1981).\nBelmontes next alleges that the jurors had improper contacts with members of the victim\u2019s family. He bases this contention on an excerpt from the record in which the trial court reprimanded one of the jurors for talking to the victim\u2019s father about motorcycles. After the reprimand, the trial court conducted a hearing and determined that the juror was not biased as a result of his contact with the victim\u2019s father. Belmontes does not assert either that the hearing was not full or that it was not fair. Nor does he assert that he has any newly discovered evidence. Accordingly, he is not entitled to a federal eviden-tiary hearing on this claim.8\nThird, Belmontes asserts that several jurors prejudged his guilt and engaged in premature deliberations. However, even assuming that the jurors did the latter, Belmontes would not necessarily be entitled to relief. See, e.g., United States v. Klee, 494 F.2d 394, 396 (9th Cir.1974) (denying motion for new trial even though jurors discussed the case during breaks and expressed premature opinions about the defendant\u2019s guilt). A petitioner must allege facts which, if proved, would show that the premature deliberations prejudiced him to the extent that he did not receive a fair trial. United States v. Hendrix, 549 F.2d 1225, 1229 (9th Cir.1977). Belmontes has not done so here; indeed, he has not alleged any facts other than that premature deliberations took place.\nAs to the alleged juror prejudgment, in his Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Belmontes contends that \u201c[a] sitting juror remarked, \u2018Here comes the killer,\u2019 whenever petitioner was brought into court.\u201d While this claim, if true, might possibly entitle him to relief, see Dyer v. Calderon, 151 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc) (\u201cThe bias or prejudice of even a single juror would violate [a criminal defendant\u2019s] right to a fair trial.\u201d), Belmontes did not include the issue in his request for an evidentiary hearing or present any facts that would entitle him to relief. Accordingly, the district court did not err in failing to afford him a hearing on that claim.\n*1055Because Belmontes has not alleged facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of an evi-dentiary hearing on his jury misconduct claims.\nIV. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ISSUES\n\nA. Racial Discrimination in Charging\n\nBelmontes alleges that the charging decision in his case violated the Eighth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause because it was infected by racial discrimination against defendants whose victims were white. In support of his claim, Belmontes relies on an expert report prepared by Richard Berk, a well-respected professor of sociology and statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Berk analyzed prosecutors\u2019 charging decisions in 122 death-eligible homicides committed in San Joaquin County from August 1977 through 1986.9 In order to describe accurately the role of race and ethnicity in death penalty charging, he coded data for over 450 variables. After running numerous logistic regression tests, Berk concluded that the odds of being charged with special circumstances varied significantly according to the race of the victim. A defendant who killed a white person was five times more likely to be charged with special circumstances than a defendant who killed an African American and twenty times more likely to be charged than if the victim were Latino. Predictably, however, the government\u2019s experts reviewed Berk\u2019s report and the underlying data and opined that the data did not reveal a pattern of discriminatory charging in San Joaquin County. For the purposes of this opinion, we assume the accuracy and statistical validity of the Berk report.10\nBelmontes\u2019 claim of discriminatory charging is essentially a selective prosecution claim, and we analyze it under that rubric. Selective prosecution doctrine, however, poses significant hurdles for Belmontes. The government retains broad discretion as to whom to prosecute. Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985). Because the decision to prosecute is based on such factors as the strength of the case, the government\u2019s enforcement priorities, and the case\u2019s relationship to . those priorities, the Supreme Court has stated that such decisions are \u201cparticularly ill-suited to judicial review.\u201d Id. at 607, 105 S.Ct. 1524. Therefore, a presumption of regularity supports prosecutorial judgments, and \u201cin the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official duties.\u201d United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 463, 464, 116 S.Ct. 1480 (1996) (quoting United States v. Chem. Found., Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S.Ct. 1, *105671 L.Ed. 131 (1926)). \u201cSo long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion.\u201d Bordenkircker v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978).\nYet, there is a line the prosecution may not cross. Although prosecutorial discretion is broad, it is not unlimited. United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 125, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979). Rather, \u201ca prosecutor\u2019s discretion is \u2018subject to constitutional constraints.\u2019\u201d Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464, 116 S.Ct. 1480 (quoting Batchelder, 442 U.S. at 125, 99 S.Ct. 2198). The decision to prosecute may not be based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification, including the exercise of protected statutory and constitutional rights. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464, 116 S.Ct. 1480; Wayte, 470 U.S. at 608, 105 S.Ct. 1524. Likewise, the decision to charge the death penalty cannot rest on criteria that offend the Constitution. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 293, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987); Adamson v. Ricketts, 865 F.2d 1011, 1022-23 (9th Cir.1988) (en banc), abrogated on other grounds, Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990), overruled, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002).\nIn order to prevail on a selective prosecution claim, a defendant must show that the prosecutorial policy both had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465, 116 S.Ct. 1480; see also McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756 (\u201c[T]o prevail under the Equal Protection Clause, [a defendant] must prove that the decisionmakers in his case acted with discriminatory purpose.\u201d). To establish a discriminatory effect in a race discrimination case, a defendant must prove that similarly situated individuals of a different race, or whose victims were of a different race, were not prosecuted. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 467, 116 S.Ct. 1480.11\nWe reject the government\u2019s contention that the Supreme Court rejected similar statistical evidence in McCleskey v. Kemp, and that Belmontes\u2019 statistics are therefore \u201cinsufficient as a matter of law.\u201d The factual showing made by McCleskey was materially different from the showing *1057made in this case. In McCleskey, the Supreme Court reviewed the claim of a Georgia prisoner who alleged that the Georgia capital sentencing statute violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was administered in a racially discriminatory manner. 481 U.S. at 286, 107 S.Ct. 1756. In support of his claim, McCleskey offered a sophisticated statistical study that demonstrated that Georgia defendants whose victims were white were 4.3 times as likely to receive a death sentence as those whose victims were black. Id. The Court denied his claim, holding that McCleskejfs statewide statistics did not meet his burden of proving that the imposition of the death penalty in his particular case was the product of purposeful discrimination. Id. at 293, 107 S.Ct. 1756. We have similarly refused to allow petitioners in California and Arizona to submit statistics that demonstrated racial disparities in the imposition of the death penalty statewide as evidence of discrimination in an individual case. See Carriger v. Lewis, 971 F.2d 329, 334 (9th Cir.1992) (en banc) (Arizona); Harris v. Pulley, 885 F.2d 1354, 1374-75 (9th Cir.1989) (California). Unlike McCleskey, Carriger, and Harris, however, Belmontes offered statistics that provided information limited to the charging entity \u2014 the San Joaquin County District Attorney\u2019s Office \u2014 and its death penalty charging practices over time. Thus he provided what the statistics in McCleskey lacked: information specific to the decisionmaker in his case. We conclude that statistics relating to the charging entity, such as those presented by Belmontes, are materially more probative of discrimination in capital charging than those considered by the Supreme Court in McCleskey. See United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 122 S.Ct. 2389, 2389, 153 L.Ed.2d 769 (2002) (approving of \u201ca showing regarding the record of the deci-sionmakers in respondent\u2019s case\u201d). Thus, Belmontes\u2019 proffered statistics are not barred by McCleskey and may support a prima facie showing of unlawful charging discrimination.\nWe next confront the question whether Belmontes\u2019 proffered statistical evidence proves a \u201cdiscriminatory effect\u201d under Armstrong. The statistics show that defendants whose victims were white were charged with special circumstances 30% of the time, whereas similarly situated defendants whose victims were African American or Latino were charged with special circumstances only 19% and 6% of the time, respectively. Because Belmontes\u2019 statistics revealed that individuals whose victims were white were far more likely to be charged with a capital offense than similarly situated individuals whose victims were non-white, we conclude that Belmontes established the requisite discriminatory effect. See id. (approving of statistical evidence that assesses whether similarly situated individuals were treated differently).\nUnder Armstrong, however, a discriminatory effect is not enough; Belmontes must also show that the decisionmakers in his case acted with a discriminatory purpose. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465, 116 S.Ct. 1480. Here, Belmontes must show that the San Joaquin County District Attorneys Office pursued a death sentence in his case \u201cat least in part because of\u2019 the race of his victim. Wayte, 470 U.S. at 610, 105 S.Ct. 1524 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Belmontes offered no non-statistical evidence on this point, we must decide whether his statistical evidence constitutes a prima facie showing of an intent to discriminate on the part of San Joaquin County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThe Supreme Court has not determined whether statistics relating exclusively to *1058the prosecuting authority are sufficient, standing alone, to establish a prima facie claim of discriminatory intent in a capital charging case. On the one hand, the Court \u201chas accepted statistics as proof of intent to discriminate in certain limited contexts,\u201d McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 293, 107 S.Ct. 1756, and has held that appropriate statistics may be enough to establish a prima facie case in a number of circumstances, including challenges to the composition of the jury venire, id,., Title VII employment discrimination, id. at 294, 107 S.Ct. 1756, legislative redistricting, Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 548-49, 119 S.Ct. 1545, 143 L.Ed.2d 731 (1999), and contemporaneous challenges to a prosecutor\u2019s acts. See, e.g., Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). In addition, the Court has recently reaffirmed Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), in which the petitioner, a Chinese laundry owner, relied entirely on statistics to prove that the City of San Francisco engaged in purposeful discrimination. See, e.g., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464-65, 116 S.Ct. 1480; McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 293 &amp; n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1756. On the other hand, the Court has held that statistical evidence, standing alone, is not enough to make out a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to a jury\u2019s verdict. See McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 294-96 &amp; 295 n. 14, 107 S.Ct. 1756. Although language in McCleskey suggests the \u201cimpropriety\u201d of requiring a prosecutor to explain his charging decision years after it was made, id. at 296 &amp; n. 17, 107 S.Ct. 1756, the Court acknowledged that, generally, when a petitioner makes out a prima facie case of discrimination, a prosecutor must provide an explanation. Id. &amp; n. 18.12\nWhile we think that Belmontes\u2019 statistics provide a strong showing of intentional discrimination, we need not decide whether, in a discriminatory charging case, statistics standing alone can make out a prima facie case. Assuming arguendo that they can and that Belmontes has made out a prima facie case, here the State has provided evidence that is sufficient to overcome that showing. In his deposition, the prosecutor stated that when he decided to pursue a death sentence against Belmontes, he had reason to believe that prior to the McConnell murder Belmontes had shot and killed Jerry Howard. In short, the prosecutor asserted that he pursued a death penalty against Belmontes, not because of McConnell\u2019s death alone, but because he believed that Belmontes had actually committed more than one murder. Moreover, the evidence in the record is sufficient to provide a good faith basis for such belief. Thus, there appears to be a legitimate, race-neutral reason for a prosecutor to seek a death sentence in this particular case, and therefore sufficient evidence to rebut the inference of discrimination raised by Belmontes\u2019 statistical study. More important, Belmontes does not challenge the state\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor\u2019s explanation is sufficient to rebut his prima facie case. In his brief, he does not contend that the fact that a defendant is a double murderer is not a valid reason for seeking the death penalty; nor does he argue that the statistics show that racial disparity exists with respect to cases in which the defendant has killed, or is believed to have killed, *1059more than one victim. Accordingly, we conclude that, even if Belmontes\u2019 statistics were sufficient to raise a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination, the State has successfully rebutted it by offering the prosecutor\u2019s legitimate, race-neutral explanation for his actions. We therefore deny the racial discrimination in charging claim.\n\nB. Arbitrariness and Capriciousness in Charging\n\nBelmontes also argues, independent of his discrimination claim, that the charging of special circumstances in his case was so arbitrary and capricious that it violated the Eighth Amendment. According to Bel-montes, his crime was one of the least aggravated of death-eligible crimes, yet he was one of only a very few defendants to actually receive the death penalty. In contrast, many defendants who committed far more heinous crimes than he obtained lesser punishments. According to Belmontes, this disparity shows that in San Joaquin County at the time of his trial there was \u201cno meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which[a death sentence] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.\u201d Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 313, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (White, J., concurring). Belmontes argues that because the death penalty regime under which he was charged, convicted, and sentenced is indistinguishable from that struck down in Furman, his sentence must be vacated as unconstitutionally arbitrary and capricious.\nBelmontes\u2019 claim, however, although styled as one of arbitrary death penalty charging, is actually a claim of arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. He does not argue that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to charge him with special circumstances was arbitrary and capricious. Rather, he contends that it was arbitrary and capricious to impose the death penalty on him because other defendants who had committed more heinous crimes than he did not receive the death penalty. The Supreme Court considered and rejected this claim in McCleskey. 481 U.S. at 306-12, 107 S.Ct. 1756. As we are bound by controlling precedent, we must do the same.\nV. PENALTY PHASE ISSUES\n\nA. Instructional Error\n\nBelmontes contends that the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury prevented it from considering nonstatutory mitigating circumstances relating to the likelihood that he would live a constructive life in prison and make positive contributions to others if granted life without the possibility of parole. Because we conclude that there is a reasonable probability that as a result of instructional error the jury did not consider constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence, and because we believe that the error was not harmless, we grant the petition with respect to the sentencing phase.\n\n1. Factual Background\n\nAt Belmontes\u2019 trial, the judge gave the jury the then-standard model jury instructions, modified to eliminate four factors that the prosecution and defense agreed had no relevance to the case. The jury was therefore instructed:\nIn determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed. You shall consider, take into account, and be guided by the following factors, if applicable:\n(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the exis*1060tence of any special circumstances found to be true.\n(b) The presence or absence of any criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence.\n(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction.\n(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\n(e) Whether or not the defendant acted under extreme duress or the substantial domination of another person.\n(f) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.\n(g) Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.13\nThe judge also gave the jury half of a supplemental instruction requested by the defense. The part that was given read:\n[T]he mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death penalty or a death sentence upon Mr. Belmontes. You should pay careful attention to each of these factors. Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\nThe other half of the instruction, which the trial judge refused to give, stated: \u201c[Y]ou should not limit your consideration of mitigating circumstances to these specific factors. You may also consider any other circumstances ... as reasons for not imposing the death sentence.\u201d\nAfter several hours of deliberations, the jury sent the judge a note asking, \u2018What happens if we cannot reach a verdict?\u201d and \u201cCan the majority rule on life imprisonment?\u201d The jury was brought back to the courtroom, and the judge reread a portion of the jury instructions, emphasizing that \u201call 12 jurors must agree, if you can.\u201d The jurors asked again what would happen if they could not agree, but the court refused to tell them.\nThe judge asked the jury: \u201cDo you think if I allow you to continue to discuss the matter and for you to go over the instructions again with one another, that the possibility of making a decision is there?\u201d The jurors agreed that they needed more time to deliberate. They then asked the following series of questions:\nJUROR HERN: The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?\nTHE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma'am.\nJUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?\nTHE COURT: That is right. It is a balancing process. Mr. Meyer?\nJUROR MEYER: A specific question, would this be an either/or situation, not a one, if you cannot the other [sic]?\nTHE COURT: No. It is not that.\nJUROR MEYER: It is an either/or situation?\nTHE COURT: Exactly. If you can make that either/ or decision. If you cannot, I will discharge you.\nJUROR HAILSTONE: Could I ask a question? I don\u2019t know if it is permissible. Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?\n*1061THE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision;\n\n2. Discussion\n\nThe California death penalty statute has a unique mechanism for guiding the jury\u2019s discretion. Instead of separate sets of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the statute features an eleven-factor test which focuses the jury\u2019s attention on the specifies of the crime and the background and character of the defendant. Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U.S. 967, 114 S.Ct. 2630, 129 L.Ed.2d 750 (1994); Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 190.3. The first ten factors instruct the jury to evaluate various circumstances of the crime and the defendant\u2019s age and prior convictions. See Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 190.3. The jury itself decides whether these factors are 9572 aggravating or mitigating. People v. Benson, 52 Cal.3d 754, 802, 276 Cal.Rptr. 827, 802 P.2d 330 (1990). The eleventh factor \u2014 factor (k) \u2014 is intended to function as a catch-all that will enable the jury to consider any relevant mitigating circumstance that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death. The jury is obligated to weigh and balance the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and must impose the death penalty if it determines that the circumstances in aggravation outweigh those in mitigation. See Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 190.3.\nIn this statutory scheme, the importance of factor (k) cannot be overstated. The Eighth Amendment requires that a capital jury consider all relevant mitigating evidence offered by the defendant and afford it such weight as it deems appropriate. Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782, 797, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); see also Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 114-15, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982) (\u201cThe sentencer ... may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence. But [it] may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from [its] consideration.\u201d); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (holding that the Eighth Amendment requires that the sentencer consider \u201cas a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death\u201d) (emphasis in origin nal). This broad mandate includes the duty to consider mitigating evidence that relates to a defendant\u2019s probable future behavior, especially the likelihood that he would not pose a future danger if spared but incarcerated. Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986). Factor (k) provides the only mechanism for allowing the jury to consider a substantial portion of many defendants\u2019 mitigating evidence \u2014 indeed, all mitigating evidence that does not relate to the circumstances of the crime or the defendant\u2019s age and criminal record.\nTo pass constitutional muster, the trial judge\u2019s instructions must convey to the jury that factor (k) compels it to consider all relevant mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant as a basis for a sentence less than death. \u201c[I]t is not enough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the sentencer.\u201d Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989). Rather, the trial judge\u2019s instructions must convey \u201cthat the sentencer may not be precluded from considering, and may not refuse to consider, any constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d Buchanan v. Angelone, 522 U.S. 269, 276, 118 S.Ct. 757, 139 L.Ed.2d 702 (1998), citing Penry, 492 U.S. at 317-18, 109 S.Ct. 2934; Eddings, 455 U.S. at 113-14, 102 S.Ct. 869; Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954.\nAt the time of Belmontes\u2019 trial, factor (k) allowed the jury to consider \u201c[a]ny *1062other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\u201d The Supreme Court had occasion to review this language in Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990). In Boyde, the defendant had argued that the jury instruction was unconstitutional because there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury would construe the instruction as forbidding it from considering evidence unrelated to the crime \u2014 e.g., mitigating evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s background and character. However, the Supreme Court held that because of the view \u201clong held by society\u201d that a defendant with a disadvantaged background or emotional or mental problems may be \u201cless culpable than defendants who have no such excuse,\u201d the jury was reasonably likely to have understood that the defendant\u2019s evidence of \u201chis impoverished and deprived childhood, his inadequacies as a school student, and his strength of character in the face of these obstacles\u201d could have \u201cextenuate[d] the gravity of the crime even though it [wa]s not a legal excuse for the crime.\u201d Id. at 381-82 &amp; n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190. The Court held that, because the trial judge instructed the jury that it \u201cshall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case,\u201d there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury believed that factor (k) prevented it from considering the background and character evidence introduced by Boyde and its bearing on Boyde\u2019s commission of the crime. Id. at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (emphasis in original).14 In other words, the Supreme Court held that the unadorned factor (k), at least when accompanied by an appropriate clarifying instruction, was constitutional as applied to mitigating evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s psychological make-up and history, which practically, if not legally, bore upon his commission of the crime and was offered for the purpose of reducing his culpability for the offense.\nThe same type of evidence, however, can serve an alternative forward-looking purpose, mitigating in a manner wholly unrelated to a petitioner\u2019s culpability for the crime he committed. This alternative purpose has nothing to do with persuading the jury that the defendant is less culpable with respect to the crime because of some aspect of his family background, personal history, character, or mental capacity. Rather, as defined by the Supreme Court in Skipper v. South Carolina, the jury must \u201cconsider! ] a defendant\u2019s past conduct as indicative of his probable future behavior\u201d and \u201cdraw[ ] favorable inferences\u201d about a defendant\u2019s \u201cprobable future conduct if sentenced to life in prison.\u201d 476 U.S. at 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (emphasis added).15 The Court characterized this *1063kind of mitigation as \u201can inevitable and not undesirable element of criminal sentencing\u201d and stated that, even though these kinds of inferences \u201cwould not relate specifically to petitioner\u2019s culpability for the crime he committed, there is no question but that such inferences would be mitigating in the sense that they might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d Id. at 4-5, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court held that \u201c[u]nder Eddings, such evidence may not be excluded from the sentencer\u2019s consideration.\u201d Id. at 5,106 S.Ct. 1669. The Court\u2019s opinion in Boyde did not address whether a reasonable jury would have interpreted the unadorned factor (k) instruction to include the use of this same type of evidence for a forward-looking purpose which serves to mitigate without ameliorating the crime. Boyde, 494 U.S. at 382 n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (distinguishing Boyde from Skipper on the ground that Boyde\u2019s mitigation evidence \u201cwas introduced not to demonstrate that he was a \u2018model prisoner\u2019 like Skipper and therefore unlikely to present a risk of future dangerousness but ... as part of petitioner\u2019s overall strategy to portray himself as less culpable than other defendants due to his disadvantaged background and his character strengths in the face of those difficulties.\u201d).\nBelmontes contends that his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated because the trial judge\u2019s instructions' failed to advise the jury to consider the portion of his mitigating evidence that tended to show that he would adapt well to prison and would become a constructive member of society if granted a life sentence. We review this claim of instructional error under the approach set forth by the Supreme Court in Boyde, which directs us to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction in a manner that resulted in its failure to consider constitutionally relevant evidence. 494 U.S. at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Although Belmontes\u2019 briefs emphasize the trial judge\u2019s mid-deliberation colloquy with Juror Hern,16 the Court has held that we must examine claims of instructional error in light of the record as a whole. Id. at 377, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Ac*1064cordingly, in assessing Belmontes\u2019 claim of instructional error, we consider the entire mid-deliberation colloquy as well as the original jury instructions.\nWe begin with the original instructions. As stated above, Belmontes\u2019 jury was instructed to consider and take into account \u201c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 190.3.17 Most naturally read, this instruction allows the jury to consider evidence that bears upon the commission of the crime by the defendant and excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense. We now know that such evidence includes background and character, both of which tend to explain why the defendant committed the crime. By its plain language, however, the instruction does not encompass events or considerations that are unrelated to the defendant\u2019s culpability. In particular, the instruction does not apply to those forward-looking considerations encompassed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Skipper: evidence that allows the jury to evaluate the defendant\u2019s probable future conduct if incarcerated for life without the possibility of parole \u2014 specifically, evidence that would tend to prove that Belmontes would likely live a constructive life if permanently confined within a structured prison environment. These important sentencing considerations are simply not in any respect \u201ccircumstance^] that extenuate! ] the gravity of the crime.\u201d See Skipper, 476 U.S. at 4, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (stating that lack of future dangerousness does \u201cnot relate specifically to petitioner\u2019s culpability for the crime he committed\u201d); see also Boyde, 494 U.S. at 382 n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1190.18 Moreover, unlike in Boyde, \u201csociety\u201d has not had a \u201clong held view\u201d that a defendant\u2019s likely future conduct can serve to mitigate or excuse his commission of a serious crime. Rather, the doctrine is a legal concept peculiar to capital punishment cases. Thus, in the absence of a clear instructions on point, jurors are not likely to be aware in determining the appropriate punishment in such cases that the defendant\u2019s potential for a positive adjustment to life in prison constitutes a proper mitigating factor.\nIn the current case, the most important part of Belmontes\u2019 mitigation presentation was that the jury should spare his life because he had the potential, if confined within a prison setting, to contribute positively to prison life. Although the record *1065made before the jury included a substantial amount of evidence about his difficult childhood, in his own testimony he repeatedly stated that he did not want to use his rough childhood \u201cas a crutch\u201d or an excuse. Thus, ultimately the more significant evidence related to his conduct during the period of his prior CYA incarceration and to his ability to conform his behavior to societal norms should he be confined within a structured prison environment. Belmontes\u2019 counsel argued to the jury that the evidence demonstrated that if granted life without parole, he would adapt well to prison life, would make a positive contribution to the welfare of others, and would not pose a future danger to the guards or the other inmates.\nUnlike the background and character evidence in Boyde that tended to mitigate the offense, Belmontes\u2019 mitigation evidence was simply not covered by any natural reading of the words of the unadorned factor (k) instruction. To the contrary, that instruction, read most naturally, suggested to the reasonable juror that Belmontes\u2019 evidence tending to show his probable future good conduct should be excluded from consideration, and thus that such evidence was governed by the earlier instruction that the jury \u201cconsider all of the evidence ... except as you may be hereafter instructed.\u201d At the least, the unadorned factor (k) instruction is ambiguous with respect to Skipper\u2019s requirement that the jury be permitted to consider and give effect to evidence bearing on a defendant\u2019s probable future good conduct when it decides whether to impose the death penalty, see 476 U.S. at 5, 106 S.Ct. 1669, and thus with respect to the jury\u2019s right to consider Belmontes\u2019 most important mitigating evidence.\nThe court\u2019s supplemental instructions only exacerbated did not solve this problem. Belmontes\u2019 counsel had requested instructions that would have expressly instructed the jury that it \u201cshould not limit [its] consideration of mitigating circumstances to these specific factors,\u201d i.e., the factors listed in the original instruction. However, although the trial judge gave part of the instruction requested by defense counsel, he refused to give the most critical portion. Instead, the trial judge gave a set of contradictory instructions that failed to inform the jury that it could consider the portion of Belmontes\u2019 mitigating evidence bearing on his probable future conduct. The trial judge started out on the right track by instructing the jury that it should view the statutory factors \u201cmerely as examples of some of the factors\u201d that it could consider. However, any clarity gained at the outset of the instruction was immediately undone by a su-perceding qualifying directive. The judge added, \u201cYou should pay careful attention to each of these factors,\u201d an instruction that a reasonable juror would almost certainly have understood to refer to the statutory factors, and particularly to the unconstitutionally limiting unadorned factor (k). The trial judge then continued, \u201cAny one of them [i.e., the factors] standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case,\u201d implying that only a statutory factor can support a sentence less than death. A juror who followed these instructions would likely think that he could not consider nonstatutory mitigating evidence \u2014 evidence not going to culpability \u2014 such as testimony tending to show that Belmontes would lead a constructive life if confined permanently within a structured environment. Still, the supplementary instructions did not end the matter.\nCompounding the problems with the original and supplemental instructions were the trial judge\u2019s responses to the jurors\u2019 questions during the mid-deliberation colloquy. In that colloquy, the trial *1066judge again directed the jury\u2019s attention to the literal text of the original unadorned factor (k) instruction, which strongly implied that the jury could not consider evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s probable future conduct. The jury had deliberated for several hours before it sent the judge a note indicating that it was deadlocked. The note read, \u201cWhat happens if we cannot reach a verdict?\u201d and \u201cCan the majority rule on life imprisonment?\u201d In the discussion that followed, the judge properly ascertained that further deliberations would probably be fruitful. He then suggested to the jury that it might be helpful to \u201cgo over the instructions again with one another\u201d as they continued to deliberate. It was at this point that the jurors began to question the judge with respect to the aggravating and mitigating factors. Juror Hern asked, \u201cThe statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?\u201d When the court responded affirmatively, she asked, \u201cOf those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?\u201d\nJuror Hern\u2019s questions reveal that she did not understand that her duty as a juror was to consider all of Belmontes\u2019 mitigating evidence. The most reasonable way to interpret her first question is as an effort to clarify that the jury should look to the statutory factors (a) through (g) [or unadorned (k)], as read to the jury by the trial judge, to determine what counted as aggravating and mitigating circumstances. It appears that by asking, \u201cthat was the listing?,\u201d Juror Hern wanted confirmation that there was a finite list of factors for the jury to consider and that the list consisted of the statutory factors read to the jury by the judge. This interpretation is reinforced by Juror Hern\u2019s next question: \u201cOf those certain factors, we were to decide one or the other [e.g., whether the evidence is aggravating or mitigating] and then balance the sheet?\u201d The structure of this question separates the \u201ccertain factors\u201d that appear in \u201cthe listing\u201d from other factors that may not be reflected there. It makes it clear that at least one juror believed that the jury should consider, weigh, and balance only \u201cthose certain factors\u201d that appeared in \u201cthe listing.\u201d Of course, such a belief would have been incorrect; the jury was required to consider and evaluate Belmontes\u2019 mitigating evidence relating to his potential adjustment to life in prison regardless of the fact that it was not listed in the statute.\nIn any event, Juror Hern\u2019s questions signified that she was not sure how to follow the judge\u2019s instructions.19 *1067\u201cWhen a jury makes explicit its difficulties a trial judge should clear them away with concrete accuracy.\u201d Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 612-13, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350, (1946). In this case, the trial judge had a duty to cure any ambiguity in his instructions by providing a clear description of the jury\u2019s obligations. The judge should have answered Juror Hern\u2019s questions by instructing the jury that \u201cthe listing\u201d of mitigating factors was not exhaustive and that the jury\u2019s duty was to consider and weigh all of the mitigating evidence presented by Belmontes during the sentencing phase. Cf. Boyde, 494 U.S. at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Instead, however, the judge simply affirmed Juror Hern\u2019s incorrect assumptions with a terse, \u201cThat is right.\u201d In so doing, he not only failed to correct Juror Hern\u2019s erroneous view, but he likely left all the jurors with the impression that they could consider mitigation evidence only if it appeared as one of the \u201ccertain factors\u201d in \u201cthe listing.\u201d As we have discussed, Belmontes\u2019 principal mitigating evidence does not fall in this category.\nThe trial judge also instructed the jury that it could not consider a specific subject relating to Belmontes\u2019 ability to adjust to prison life. Less than thirty seconds after Juror Hern\u2019s inquiry, Juror Hailstone said: \u201cCould I ask a question? I don\u2019t know if it is permissible. Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?\u201d The trial judge responded: \u201cThat is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\u201d He did not explain why the jury could not consider this issue, and immediately after issuing this response, he sent the jury off to resume its deliberations. The instruction not to consider possible future psychiatric treatment was misleading because of the judge\u2019s failure to explain to the jury why it could not consider the prohibited subject; to the extent that the jury believed that it could not consider mitigating evidence relating to how Belmontes might behave in a controlled prison environment, the instruction as given would likely have confirmed its misconception.\nJuror Hailstone\u2019s question and the trial judge\u2019s response are troubling because of the likelihood that the jury understood them in the context of the larger discussion about how to consider, weigh, and balance aggravating and mitigating circumstances.20 In such case, the jury *1068would have inferred from the trial judge\u2019s response that it could not consider Juror Hailstone\u2019s question, not because there had been no evidence presented on the subject at trial, but because it raised a consideration that did not relate to one of the \u201ccertain factors\u201d set forth in \u201cthe listing,\u201d or, to put it differently, to one of the factors bearing on the defendant\u2019s culpability for the crime. The trial judge\u2019s response thus likely reinforced the jury\u2019s mistaken notion that Belmontes\u2019 mitigation evidence relating to his probable future good conduct if confined in a structured prison environment was irrelevant to the sentencing decision.\nThe next question is whether the trial judge\u2019s various instructions relating to limitations on the evidence that could be considered had an effect on the jury\u2019s deliberations. We may not reverse the jury\u2019s penalty determination unless the instructions actually created \u201ca reasonable probability that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (emphasis added). The jury\u2019s decision must stand \u201cif there is only a possibility of such an inhibition.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\nWe hold that there is a reasonable probability that, as a result of the court\u2019s instructions, the jury in Belmontes\u2019 case did not consider his principal mitigating evidence. The trial judge began by giving a faulty instruction, one that on its face arguably does not allow consideration of mitigating evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s probable future good behavior in prison, as opposed to his culpability for the crime. He then rejected a significant part of the supplemental instruction that Bel-montes proposed in an effort to solve the problem. The jurors were understandably confused, and they asked questions of the court in an effort to clarify the scope of their duty. In the course of that dialogue, the trial judge endorsed Juror Hern\u2019s view of the instructions, a view that strongly suggested that the jury could consider, weigh, and balance only \u201cthose certain factors\u201d that appeared in \u201cthe listing.\u201d Following that endorsement, the trial judge advised the jury without further explanation that, in making its decision, it could not consider the possibility that Belmontes could receive psychiatric treatment in prison. In sum, every instruction that the jury received tended to convey the message that the jury could not consider Bel-montes\u2019 mitigating evidence unless it related to his culpability for the crime. Under these circumstances, there is, at the least, a reasonable probability that the jury did not consider Belmontes\u2019 principal mitigation evidence \u2014 the evidence that provided the factual support for his argument in mitigation: that he would five a productive life if permanently incarcerated in a structured environment. Because \u201c[t]he Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner,\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 377-78, 110 S.Ct. 1190, the unadorned factor (k) instruction, as applied in Belmontes\u2019 case, was unconstitutional.\nHaving concluded that an error of constitutional magnitude infected the penalty phase of Belmontes\u2019 trial, we turn finally to the question whether that error was nonetheless harmless. See Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (applying Brecht harmless error standard). Belmontes cannot obtain a new trial unless the instructional error had \u201ca substantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710. We hold that it did.\nOur cases are divided as to whether the petitioner, the state, or neither bears the *1069responsibility for showing harmless error under the Brecht harmless error standard. Compare Rodriguez v. Marshall, 125 F.3d 739, 744 (9th Cir.1997) (placing burden on petitioner), with Keating v. Hood, 191 F.3d 1053, 1062 (9th Cir.1999) (as amended) (placing burden on state), and Thompson v. Borg, 74 F.3d 1571, 1575 (9th Cir.1996) (rejecting burdens of proof in favor of an independent determination of whether a trial error had a substantial and injurious effect). In a recent case, we attempted to clarify the rule, holding that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has made clear that whether a trial error had a substantial and injurious effect is not to be. analyzed in terms of burdens of proof.\u201d Mancuso v. Olivarez, 282 F.3d 728, 737 n. 4 (9th Cir.), as amended, 292 F.3d 939 (2002), citing O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 436, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). In Mancuso, we explained that the reviewing court has \u201cthe responsibility to determine this legal question \u2018without benefit of such aids as presumptions or allocated burdens of proof that expedite factfinding at the trial.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting O\u2019Neal, 513 U.S. at 437, 115 S.Ct. 992). Nevertheless, we stated that \u201c[I]f one is left in grave doubt [about the harmfulness of the error], the conviction cannot stand.\u201d Id. (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). Because the court was convinced that the constitutional error in that case was neither substantial nor injurious, and because it did not find itself in \u201cgrave doubt,\u201d it upheld the conviction. Id. at 953, 958.\nA subsequent decision of the en banc court affirmed Mancuso\u2019s reasoning but went on to address what the court should do when it finds itself in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d about the harmlessness of the error.21 See Payton v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 815, 828-30 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), vacated on other grounds, 71 U.S.L.W. 3489 (U.S. Apr. 21, 2003)' (No. 02-1055). We held:\nIn the course of this inquiry, it is the State that bears the \u201crisk of doubt.\u201d [O\u2019Neal, 513 U.S.] at 438, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947. When issues arise during our analysis which create uncertainty, the petitioner is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. See id. at 436, 438-43, 513 U.S. 432, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947. At the close of our inquiry, we step back to determine where we are on the spectrum of certainty about the harmlessness of the constitutional error...., In the \u201cnarrow circumstance\u201d in which we are in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d as to the effect of the constitutional error, we must ... grant the petition. O\u2019Neal, 513 U.S. at 437, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947; see also Thompson, 74 F.3d at 1575.\nThus, we look to the State to instill in us a \u201cfair assurance\u201d that there was no effect on the verdict. Gray [v. Klauser, 282 F.3d 633, 651 (9th Cir.2002)]; United States v. Hitt, 981 F.2d 422, 425 (9th Cir.1992); see also O\u2019Neal, 513 U.S. at 443, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (\u201c[T]he State normally bears responsibility for the error that infected the initial trial.\u201d). Only if the State has persuaded us that there was no substantial and injurious effect on the verdict do we find the error harmless.\nPayton, 299 F.3d at 828 (emphasis added); see also id. at 828-29 (examining Supreme Court precedent and concluding that \u201c[t]his framework is faithful to the balance the Supreme Court has struck between *1070concerns of federal-state comity and finality in state criminal trials, and the irreversible harm caused by an execution resulting from an unconstitutional error\u201d). Because we found ourselves in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d about the effect of the instructional error in that case, we held that the error was not harmless, and we granted the writ with respect to the penalty phase. Id. at 830.\nHere we need not consider whether the state, the defendant, or neither party bears the burden of proof, or whether to follow the approach set forth in the vacated en banc opinion. We do not find ourselves in \u201cgrave doubt.\u201d The issue of burdens is irrelevant to this case. No matter who has the burden, or if there is no burden at all, we are convinced that the instructional error in this case, which prevented the jury from considering and giving effect to Belmontes\u2019 most important mitigation evidence, had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. At the penalty phase of this trial the aggravating evidence was not strong. It basically consisted of the fact that Belmontes was previously incarcerated in the youth facility for being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter, one domestic violence incident, and two occurrences relating to possession, or possible possession, of a gun. The prosecutor candidly told the jury that there was not a lot in the way of aggravating evidence. He asked the jury to return a death sentence because of the circumstances of the crime itself. Yet the crime, though shocking and deplorable, was in essence a robbery gone wrong. The murder was not pre-planned, nor did it involve kidnapping, rape, torture, multiple victims, or any of the other especially heinous elements that usually are present when a jury votes for the ultimate penalty. In short, the McConnell murder was of the kind that generally does not result in a death penalty.22\nUnder these circumstances, there is a reasonable probability that a properly instructed jury would have spared Bel-montes\u2019 life had it believed that he would not pose a future danger if sentenced to life without parole, and that instead he would become a model prisoner who could contribute something of value to society. The stat\u00e9 concedes that Belmontes presented \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence in support of this mitigation theme. Several witnesses, including Belmontes himself, testified that although he had difficult in acting appropriately in the outside world, he thrived in the structured, institutional environment of prison. Belmontes described his experience on the CYA\u2019s fire crew, during which he rose from last man to number two, a position of leadership and responsibility, and about his gradually increasing involvement in Christianity during his prior incarceration. Reverend Barrett spoke about Belmontes\u2019 participation in the M-2 Christian sponsorship program, which he felt was genuine, and testified that in his opinion if granted a life sentence Belmontes would make positive contributions to prison life through his involvement with the prison ministries. One of Belmontes\u2019 most important witnesses was Reverend Miller, who testified that Belmontes had been good at counseling young inmates not to repeat the mistakes that he had made and that he \u201cdefinitely would be used in the prison system for this kind of activity\u201d if granted life without parole.\n*1071The importance of this mitigation theme was stressed during closing arguments. In his allocution, Belmontes took responsibility for his actions and stated that he did not want to use his difficult childhood as an excuse. He asked the jury to give him the opportunity to rehabilitate himself, set goals, and make a positive contribution to the welfare of others while in prison. His counsel repeated this theme in his emotional closing argument, in which he asked the jury to spare Belmontes life on the ground that he would make positive contributions if allowed to live out his natural life in prison.\nGiven the weakness of the aggravating evidence and the substantial nature of the mitigating evidence, we conclude that had the jury been properly instructed, and had it understood that it could consider and give effect to the evidence regarding Bel-montes\u2019 ability to function effectively in a prison setting, there is a reasonable probability that it would have returned a different verdict. Accordingly, Belmontes is entitled to relief on the sentencing phase.\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough we are disturbed by the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose impeaching evidence and to correct false testimony on the part of its principal witness, as well as by defense counsel\u2019s failure to disclose the extent of his prior representation of Vasquez and to pursue a full investigation of Vasquez\u2019s background, and although we are at least as disturbed by the results of the study that showed the discriminatory racial effect of the County\u2019s capital charging policies, we cannot conclude, for the reasons we have explained, that any of these occurrences served to violate Bel-montes\u2019 constitutional rights. Thus, we are compelled to deny relief with respect to the guilt phase, including the special circumstances finding. However, because the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that it was required to consider Belmontes\u2019 principal mitigation evidence, and because we conclude that this failure had a substantial and injurious effect upon the verdict, we reverse with respect to the sentencing phase. We remand to the district court with instructions to issue an appropriate writ vacating Belmontes\u2019 death sentence.\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for issuance of the writ in accordance with this opinion.\n\n. Bolanos later led police to the location on the river bank from which the bar was recovered.\n\n\n. Cobarrubio testified that she recalled running into Murillo at the Grape Festival. Murillo had asked her whether she thought Belmontes \"might have been set up.\u201d Co-barrubio replied: \"Well, he might have.\u201d Cobarrubio testified further that in fact she had no information from any source that Belmontes had been set up but answered as she did because she felt sorry for Murillo.\n\n\n. The prosecutor\u2019s proffer included testimony from an eyewitness who saw Belmontes shoot Howard, a CYA counselor to whom Bel-montes had confessed that he did so, another individual who saw Howard get into a car with Belmontes on the evening he was killed, and the police officer who found the murder weapon at Belmontes' house.\n\n\n.Belmontes also argues that the trial judge independently violated his due process rights by failing to inquire adequately into the conflict and failing to advise Belmontes about the nature and consequences of the conflict. We do not address this claim because Belmontes cannot prevail on it without showing that Schick labored under an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his def\u00e9nse, a showing Belmontes cannot make for the reasons explained hereafter. Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002) (extending Cuyler burden of proof to situations in which trial judge failed to inquire into conflict about which he knew or reasonably should have known).\n\n\n. Earlier, Vasquez\u2019s counsel had successfully moved to recuse Schick\u2019s investigator. This investigator had previously worked on Vasquez's 1979 murder case, and at the time of Belmontes\u2019 trial he worked part-time in the public defender's office, which represented Vasquez in the McConnell murder.\n\n\n. Schick avers that he was not aware of this case at the time he represented Belmontes.\n\n\n. The warrant reads:\nDetective Elbert Holman, San Joaquin County Sheriffs Office, will testify that: he responded to 17281 N. Sunrise St. Victor, CA on 3/15/81 in the early afternoon. The house was ransacked.\nDeputy St. Sure will testify he was the first deputy Sheriff to arrive at 17281 N. Sunrise. Steacy McConnell was on the floor being administered to by medical personnel. Steacy McConnell subsequently died.\nDr. Madieros did the autopsy on Steacy McConnel. The cause of death was blunt trauma to the head.\nBob Bolanos, after being advised of his Miranda rights, waived those rights and told Detective the following: That he went to the home of Domingo Vasquez, Jr. He was with Fernando Delmontes on 3/15/81. While at the Vasquez house, Vasquez called Stacy Me Connell. Thereafter, the three of them talked about the fact that Steacy possessed some expensive property at her residence. Fernando Delmontes said he needed money to send to his wife in Los Angeles. Delmontes decided to burglarize the McConnell residence after Vasquez told them McConnell would not be home. Vasquez and Bolanos agreed to go with Delmontes. Bolanos drive them to McConnell\u2019s in his car. Upon arriving in the vicinity, Delmontes got out, carrying an iron bar he had brought with him from Vasquez\u2019s house.\nDelmontes told Bolanos to wait in the car for 30 minutes, then to drive to McConnell's and get him.\nWhen they drove to McConnell\u2019s, they opened the trunk, and Vasquez went into the house. Vasquez carried stereo speakers from the house to the car trunk. Del-montes followed Vasquez out with the receiver portion of the stereo. Delmontes was splattered with blood. Vasquez was not. Delmontes said McConnel was in the house, and when Bolanos drove up, he beat her with the iron bar. The stereo was later sold, and the proceeds divided.\n\n\n. Moreover, the state court's factual determination is subject to a presumption of correctness. Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1037 n. 12, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1994). To overcome the presumption, Bel montes must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the state court\u2019s factual finding was erroneous. Patton, 467 U.S. at 1037 n. 12, 104 S.Ct. 2885. However, he submitted no evidence tending to overcome the presumption, and the record contains none.\n\n\n. The data set consisted of probation department reports for all death-eligible homicides charged during the relevant time period, except 70 cases for which the County lacked complete reports, 52 cases in which the defendants were not bound over for trial on murder charges, and six cases in which the defendants were female.\n\n\n. The district court questioned the relevance of the Berk report on the ground that Berk based his conclusions on \"a model that used only four non-racial factors.\u201d Although the tables printed in the report contained only four non-racial variables, the report stated that Berk and his team actually considered many other variables in addition to those set forth in the tables. In his declaration, Berk characterized the small, six-variable model as \u201csimply a summary\u201d and stated that he considered all the variables in the data set, which included many non-racial factors. We have no reason to disbelieve Berk\u2019s sworn statement and can only conclude that the district court was mistaken.\n\n\n. In Armstrong, the Supreme Court stated that \"[t]o establish a discriminatory effect in a race case, the claimant must show that similarly situated individuals of a different race were not prosecuted.\u201d 517 U.S. at 465, 116 S.Ct. 1480 (emphasis added). Belmontes\u2019 statistics do not meet this showing. Nevertheless, although Belmontes' claim is based on the race of his victim, not his own race, we do not read this sentence as barring our review. In McCleskey, the court examined a statistical study that showed statistical disparities according to the race of the victim. 481 U.S. at 286-87, 107 S.Ct. 1756. In that case, the State argued that McCleskey did not have standing to raise a discrimination claim based on his victim's race. Id. at 291 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 1756. The Court concluded that McCleskey did have standing to raise this claim, id., and it addressed directly McCleskey\u2019s argument that he was \"discriminated against ... because of the race of his victim.\u201d Id. at 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756. Armstrong did not discuss the issue of the victim's race at all, nor did the majority opinion even mention McCleskey. That question was simply not before the Court. In short, we are confident that Armstrong did not intend to overrule the pertinent portion of McCleskey. Accordingly, we conclude that a defendant may bring a selective prosecution claim based solely on the race of his victim, and that to establish a discriminatory effect in a race-of-the-victim case, he must show that similarly situated individuals whose victims were of a different race were not prosecuted.\n\n\n. We note that a decision to charge a capital rather than a non-capital offense is far more significant and important than a decision to challenge a particular juror. A charging decision is made with great deliberation over a period of time and is generally the product of a deliberative process involving more than one person. Moreover, unlike the case of a juror challenge, there is a full record of the relevant events that ordinarily contains all of the objective factors upon which the decision-making would have been based.\n\n\n. To remain consistent with the text of the statute and the Supreme Court\u2019s terminology in Boyde, we will refer to this factor as \"factor (k)\u201d or \"unadorned factor (k).\u201d\n\n\n. The Court also defined \"extenuates\u201d to mean \"lessens the seriousness of a crime as by giving an excuse.\u201d Id. at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190.\n\n\n. In attempting to extend Boyde to issues of future conduct, the dissent errs by focusing on the temporal nature of the evidence rather than the purpose for which it is introduced. In the instant case, the operative distinction is not between categories of \"pre-crime\u201d and \"post-crime\u201d evidence in the sense of when the acts that constitute the evidence occurred, but rather between a jury's use of background and character evidence to mitigate culpability for the crime, as opposed to the use of the same type of evidence to draw favorable inferences about petitioner's probable future conduct. This latter use of the evidence can, as Skipper holds, serve as a wholly separate and independent basis for a sentence less than death.\nThe dissent also attempts to distinguish Payton v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 2002)(en banc), vacated on other grounds by-U.S.-, 123 S.Ct 1785, 155 L.Ed.2d 662 (U.S. Apr. 21, 2003)(No. 02 1055), on similarly erroneous grounds. Post, at 1072. In Payton, the mitigating evidence fell outside *1063the meaning of factor (k) because its \"post-crime\" character meant that it served to mitigate without ameliorating the crime itself. Payton, 299 F.3d at 824. Similarly, this alternative use of \"pre-crime\u201d evidence can mitigate without ameliorating the crime itself. Thus, the central question is not whether the jury \"was able to consider and give effect to all of Belmontes\u2019 mitigating evidence,\u201d post. at 1073 (emphasis added), but rather what mitigating effect the jury understood to be permissible under the instruction as stated. Skipper requires that the jury understand that evidence must be given mitigating effect whether it bears on petitioner\u2019s culpability for the crime or instead relates to petitioner\u2019s future potential for constructive conduct.\n\n\n. We reject the government\u2019s argument that the mid-deliberation exchange does not count as a jury instruction because it was \"rather informal\u201d and occurred after the formal charge. See Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. 36, 121 S.Ct. 1263, 1274, 149 L.Ed.2d 178 (2001) (labeling the trial judge's answer to the jury\u2019s mid-deliberation question an \"instruction\u201d and criticizing it because it \u201cdid nothing to ensure that the jury was not misled\u201d); Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946) (reversing and remanding because a \u201csupplemental instruction\u201d from the trial court following a question by the jury was \"simply wrong\u201d); McDowell v. Calderon, 130 F.3d 833, 836 (9th Cir.1997) (enbanc), overruled in part on other grounds, Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 120 S.Ct. 727, 145 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (explaining that the trial judge's duty to instruct the jury adequately \"continues until a verdict is reached and returned. As they work towards a verdict, the jurors must stay in the channel charted for them by state law. To this end, they may need ongoing guidance.\u201d).\n\n\n. The California legislature has since reformulated the instruction to direct the jury to consider \"any sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record [that the defendant offers] as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is on trial.\" CALJIC 8.85(k) (6th ed.1996). See also People v. Easley, 34 Cal.3d 858, 196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813 (1983) (recognizing that unadorned factor (k) had significant potential for jury confusion.).\n\n\n. Our en banc court recently considered the identical unadorned factor (k) instruction, applying the pre-AEDPA standard of review we apply here, and reached the same conclusion on the merits that we do. See generally Payton v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 815 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). However, the Supreme Court vacated the en banc opinion and remanded so that we could determine in light of intervening precedent whether we should have applied the AEDPA standard to Payton\u2019s claims. Woodford v. Payton, 71 U.S.L.W. 3489 (U.S. Apr. 21, 2003) (No. 02-1055) (vacating and remanding in light of Woodford v. Garceau,-U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003)). The Court did not reach Payton's substantive holding. Id. In the current case, there is no doubt that the pre-AEDPA standard of review applies. While we see no reason to question the correctness of the en banc court\u2019s substantive analysis, and although we could accept its reasoning as persuasive, we reach that same result here on the basis of our own independent analysis.\n\n\n. The Supreme Court has frequently accepted jury questions as evidence that the trial judge's original instructions were not sufficiently clear. See, e.g., Shafer, 121 S.Ct. at 1273 (\"Shafer's jury left no doubt about its failure to gain from defense counsel's closing argument or the judge\u2019s instructions any clear understanding of what a life sentence means.\u201d); Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 178, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994) (\"[Tjhat the jury in this case felt compelled to ask whether parole was available shows that the jurors did not know whether or not a life-sentenced defendant will be released from prison.\u201d); Bollenbach, 326 U.S. at 612, 66 S.Ct. 402 (\"The jury\u2019s questions ... clearly indicated that the jurors were confused.\u201d). We have done so as well. E.g., Morris v. Woodford, 273 F.3d 826, 840 (9th Cir.2001) (citing fact that jury asked mid-deliberation question as evidence that it was confused by the original instruction); United States v. Frega, 179 F.3d 793 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that a reviewing court may infer from the jury's questions that it was confused about a controlling legal principle). Here, as in those cases, Juror Hem\u2019s questions strengthen our conviction that the original and supplemental instructions did not convey to the jury that it could consider Belmontes\u2019 non-statutory mitigating evidence pertaining to his probable future behavior in prison if incarcerated for life.\n*1067We need not rely on affirmative evidence of jury confusion in order to reach this conclusion, however. See Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U.S. 246, 122 S.Ct. 726, 733, 151 L.Ed.2d 670 (2002) (\"Time after time appellate courts have found jury instructions to be insufficiently clear without any record that the jury manifested its confusion.\u201d). \"A trial judge\u2019s duty is to give instructions sufficient to explain the law, an obligation that exists independently of any question from the jurors or any indication of perplexity on their part.\u201d Id. To hold otherwise would condition our ability to redress serious constitutional violations on such subjective vagaries of fate as whether the jurors happened to ask a question instead of embarking boldly down the wrong path.\n\n\n. The government insists that the reason for his answer was obvious: There was no evidence presented on the topic of possible psychiatric treatment at Belmontes' trial; therefore, the jury could not consider it. The government argues that the jurors would have realized that this was why they could not consider Juror Hailstone's question, and so the trial judge\u2019s response could have had no effect on their deliberations. We reject this contention. The jurors at Belmontes\u2019 trial were not lawyers; they were not schooled in the rules of evidence, and they had no reason to know that the trial judge's response was based on an evidentiary concern (if, in fact, it was based on an eviden-tiary concern rather than on the trial judge's misunderstanding of the law). It is far more likely that the jury would have viewed this question and its answer in the manner that we have described.\n\n\n. Payton characterized the appropriate inquiry as: \"Do I, the judge, think that the error substantially influenced the jury's decision?\u201d Id. at 828 (quoting O'Neal, 513 U.S. at 436, 115 S.Ct. 992. It stated that the court should answer this question without reference to presumptions and burdens of proof. Id. at 827-28.\n\n\n. On this point, Belmontes submitted evidence that, of the thirty defendants who were tried for felony-murder in San Joaquin County between 1977 and 1986, only two, including Belmontes himself, received a death sentence. Many defendants whose crimes by any measure were substantially more aggravated than Belmontes' did not receive a death penalty.\n\n",

I am pleased to concur in its conclusions as to the guilt phase. Regrettably, as to the penalty phase, the majority strains mightily \u2014 and unpersuasively- \u2014 to perceive constitutional error in the comprehensive and perfectly proper jury instructions given by the state trial judge. \u25a0 Because there simply is no such error, and the Supreme Court has expressly told us so, I must respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s grant of the writ with respect to the penalty phase.\nJust over a decade ago, the Supreme Court in Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990), interpreted the same jury instruction at issue today, \u201cfactor (k),\u201d and concluded that it was constitutionally sound. The Court held that there was no \u201creasonable likelihood that the jury ... applied [factor (k)] in a way that prevent[ed] the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\u201d Id. at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190. Nonetheless, the majority manages to distinguish Boyde, and makes the extraordinary conclusion that there was a reasonable likeli*1072hood that the jury refused to consider mitigating evidence that both the prosecution and the defense acknowledged was properly before it. Because the jurors were not constitutionally barred from making a death penalty determination in this case, I would affirm.\n\u2022I\nAt the close of the penalty phase, the state trial court judge began instructing the jury on aggravating and mitigating circumstances as follows: \u201cIn determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed.\u201d The court then read an enumerated list of seven factors, exhaustive with respect to aggravating circumstances, but only examples with respect to mitigating circumstances. The last of these factors, factor (k), instructs the jury to consider, \u201c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\u201d The majority, by misconstruing both Supreme Court precedent and the evidence in this case, concludes that the factor (k) instruction failed to provide an outlet for the jury to consider some of Belmontes\u2019s penalty phase evidence.\nA\nThe majority\u2019s holding is based on the false premise that factor (k) limits the jury\u2019s consideration only to circumstances that might excuse the crime. See supra, at 1061. But the Court has already explicitly rejected this proposition. In Boyde, the Court held that factor (k) did not \u201climit the jury\u2019s consideration to \u2018any other circumstances of the crime which extenuates the gravity of the crime.\u2019 [It directed the jury] to consider any other circumstance that might excuse the crime, which certainly includes a defendant\u2019s background and character.\u201d 494 U.S. at 382, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (emphases in original); see also id. at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (holding that there was \u201cno[ ] ... reasonable likelihood that Boyde\u2019s jurors interpreted the trial court\u2019s instructions to prevent consideration of mitigating evidence of background and character.\u201d). Boyde makes it perfectly clear that testimony relating to a defendant\u2019s pre-crime background and character is within1 the jury\u2019s purview under factor (k).\nBelmontes\u2019s penalty phase presentation was entirely composed of such evidence. The witnesses who testified on his behalf spoke to his religious convictions and his behavior while a ward of the \u25a0 California Youth' Authority (\u201cCYA\u201d) \u2014 all of which goes to his background and character before he murdered Steacy. While the majority attempts to paint such evidence as showing that he would be a model inmate if sentenced to life in prison, the testimony as actually presented deals exclusively with his character prior to the crime. In fact, not one witness who testified during the penalty phase testified to Belmontes\u2019s behavior after the murder.\nBy deftly labeling such testimony as \u201cpost-crime\u201d mitigation evidence, the majority attempts to fit within the scope of Payton v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 815, 824-25 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), vacated on other grounds by 71 U.S.L.W. 3489 (U.S. Apr. 21, 2003) (No. 02-1055). Such attempt cannot work because Payton involved actual post-crime evidence \u2014 Payton\u2019s conversion to Christianity following his crime. Here, all of the evidence related to Bel-montes\u2019s character before he committed his crime. Belmontes\u2019s religious conversion and ability to conform to prison are exactly the types of evidence which the Supreme Court held fit within the plain language of *1073factor (k). See Boyde, 494 U.S. at 382, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (holding that Boyde\u2019s strength of character in the face of adversity was considered evidence which \u201cexcused\u201d the gravity of the crime under factor (k)). Accordingly, under Boyde, the jury was able to consider and to give effect to all of Belmontes\u2019s mitigating evidence. Nothing more was constitutionally required. Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 372-73, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) (holding that \u201ca jury [need not] be able to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant.\u201d).\nEven so, the Supreme Court has held that inquiry into future dangerousness of a defendant \u201cis not independent of an assessment of personal culpability.\u201d Id. at 369, 113 S.Ct. 2658. In Johnson, the Court held that an instruction which asked jurors to consider the future dangerousness of a defendant provided ample opportunity for the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s youth as mitigating evidence. Id. at 369-70, 113 S.Ct. 2658. Even though the statutory factor did not explicitly provide that the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s youth as a mitigating factor for culpability of the crime, the Court concluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have thought it was foreclosed from considering it. Id. at 370, 113 S.Ct. 2658.\nLikewise, because factor (k) allows the jury to consider Belmontes\u2019s character and background, there is no reason to think that the jury would have thought it was foreclosed from using such information to consider his future potential if sentenced to life in prison. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cConsideration of a defendant\u2019s past conduct as indicative of his probable future behavior is an inevitable and not undesirable element of criminal sentencing.\u201d Skipper, 476 U.S. at 5, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (emphasis added); see Boyde, 494 U.S. at 382, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (\u201cPetitioner had an opportunity through factor (k) to argue that his background and character \u2018extenuated\u2019 or \u2018excused\u2019 the seriousness of the crime, and we see no reason to believe that reasonable jurors would resist the view, \u2018long held by society,\u2019 that in an appropriate case such evidence would counsel imposition of a sentence less than death.\u201d); ef. Johnson, 509 U.S. at 370, 113 S.Ct. 2658.\nThus, while the majority scours the cold record decades after the trial to find an ambiguity in the sentencing instruction, it is highly doubtful that the jury itself would have so found. \u201cJurors do not sit in solitary isolation booths parsing instructions for subtle shades of meaning in the same way that lawyers might.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380-81, 110 S.Ct. 1190. I see no reason why the jury would have resisted the inevitable consideration of Belmontes\u2019s future potential in light of the character evidence presented.\nB\nThe majority also ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s advice that \u201c[djifferences in interpretation may be thrashed out in the deliberative process, with commonsense understanding of the instructions in light of all that has taken place at the trial likely to prevail over technical hairsplitting.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380-81, 110 S.Ct. 1190. That factor (k) permits the consideration of Belmontes\u2019s character evidence is amplified when the penalty phase is viewed as a whole, particularly in light of the arguments made by counsel.\nLike the instruction given in- Boyde, the jury in this case was told that it must consider all the evidence unless otherwise instructed. Boyde, 494 U.S. at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (relying in part on the fact that Boyde\u2019s jury was instructed that it \u201cshall consider all of the evidence which has been *1074received during any part of the case\u201d (emphasis in original)). Although it is undisputed here that neither the'Court nor the parties told the jury that it could not consider any of the evidence presented by Belmontes, the majority infers ambiguity.\nIn this case, the jury heard, without objection, evidence regarding Belmontes\u2019s behavior in prison before the murder: how he had found God and how he could serve as an example to other inmates. In its closing argument, the prosecution stated, \u201cI suspect you will be told ... that the defendant\u2019s religious experience is within that catchall [factor (k)] that relates to the defendant at the time he committed the crime, extenuates the gravity of the crime. I\u2019m not really sure it fits in there. I\u2019m not sure it really fits in any of them.\u201d Even so, the prosecutor noted, \u201cBut I think it [Belmontes\u2019s religious experience] appears to be a proper subject of consideration.\u201d\nLater the prosecutor expounded on why the jury should consider Belmontes\u2019s evidence:\nI suppose you can say it would be appropriate [to consider such evidence] because \u2014 in this fashion: The defendant may be of value to the community later. You recall the people talking about how he would have the opportunity to work with other prisoners in prison. And I think that value to the community is something that you have to weigh in. There\u2019s something to that.\nBelmontes\u2019s pleas were similar. Bel-montes asked for fife in prison because in prison \u201cthere is an opportunity to achieve goals and try to better yourself.\u201d His counsel continued the argument, asking the jury to spare Belmontes\u2019s life because he would make a positive contribution if his life were spared: \u201c[W]hat I am suggesting to you and what I hope the evidence suggests to you is Fernando Bel-montes cannot make it on the outside. I think it is pretty clear from the development he undertook, the kind of experiences he had with the Haros as compared with his being placed out on his own.\u201d He added,\nThe people who came in here told you about him. They told you not only what they know of him, but they gave you, as best they could, under the very difficult circumstances of somebody looking at the rest of their life in prison, a game plan, something he can do with his life, something he\u2019s been able to do. We\u2019re just suggesting the tip of the iceberg because who knows in 20, 30, 40, 50 years what sorts of things he can do, as he fits into the system, as he learns to set his goals, to contribute something in whatever way he can.,\nAt no time did the prosecutor object to the defense\u2019s characterization, nor did the trial judge indicate that the parties\u2019 statements of law were not correct or that the jury could not consider any of the evidence. Nevertheless, the majority concludes that the jury thought that the witnesses wasted their time by testifying, and that the prosecutor, Belmontes, and Bel-montes\u2019s lawyer were not smart enough to realize they were all mistaken. In its world, the majority envisions a jury playing a game of \u201cgotcha\u201d with the lawyers, whereby the jury ignores everyone and applies its own instructions. \u25a0\nSuch a conclusion is pure fantasy and cannot justify overturning the jury\u2019s choice here. Compare Buchanan v. Angelone, 522 U.S. 269, 278-79, 118 S.Ct. 757, 139 L.Ed.2d 702 (1998) (\u201cThe parties in effect agreed that there was substantial mitigating evidence and that the jury had to weigh that evidence against petitioner\u2019s conduct in making a discretionary decision on the appropriate penalty. In this context, \u2018there is not a reasonable likelihood that the jurors in petitioner\u2019s case under*1075stood the challenged instructions to preclude consideration of relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner.\u2019 \u201d), with Payton v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 815, 824-25 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), vacated on other grounds by 71 U.S.L.W. 3489 (U.S. Apr. 21, 2003) (No. 02-1055) (holding that the prosecutor\u2019s argument that factor (k) did not allow the jury to consider evidence of a post-crime religious conversion \u201ccompounded the potential for confusion\u201d).\nII\nEven assuming, arguendo, that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury could have interpreted factor (k) to prohibit consideration of Belmontes\u2019s character witnesses, the instructions were still constitutionally sufficient. To arrive at its result, the majority downplays the trial court\u2019s initial instruction, in which the jury was told, \u201cIn determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed.\u201d (emphasis added). Such a jury instruction alone is constitutionally sufficient to convey to the jury its duty to consider all mitigating evidence. See Buchanan, 522 U.S. at 276, 118 S.Ct. 757 (holding that there was no likelihood of confusion when the jury had to indicate on the statutory verdict form that it had \u201cconsidered the evidence in mitigation of the offense,\u201d and the trial court provided the following mitigation instruction: \u201c[I]f you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment\u201d); Johnson, 509 U.S. at 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658 (holding that jury instruction that stated the jury could consider all the mitigating evidence presented during both the guilt and penalty stage was sufficient to inform the jury that it could consider evidence of defendant\u2019s youth); Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299, 307-08, 110 S.Ct. 1078, 108 L.Ed.2d 255 (1990) (\u201cIn petitioner\u2019s case the jury was specifically instructed to consider, as mitigating evidence, any \u2018matter concerning the character or record of the defendant, or the circumstances of his offense.\u2019 This was sufficient to satisfy the dictates of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d (citation to the record omitted)); cf. Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U.S. 967, 979, 114 S.Ct. 2630, 129 L.Ed.2d 750 (1994) (\u201cA capital sentencer need not be instructed how to weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing decision.\u201d).\nThe trial court\u2019s duty is simply to convey to the jury that all mitigating evidence must be considered and may be given effect when it deliberates on a defendant\u2019s capital sentence. Buchanan, 522 U.S. at 276, 118 S.Ct. 757. The absence of any specific instruction to the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s ability to adjust to an institutional setting is utterly irrelevant. Id. at 277, 118 S.Ct. 757 (\u201cBy directing the jury to base its decision on \u2018all the evidence,\u2019 the instruction afforded jurors an opportunity to consider mitigating evidence.\u201d).\nEven if the jury were confused by the subsequent enumeration of individual factors \u2014 perhaps thinking that its consideration of mitigating evidence was limited to such factors \u2014 the confusion would have been short lived. After reading the enumerated factors, the court instructed, \u201c[T]he mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death penalty or a death sentence upon Mr. Bel-montes.\u201d The majority, however, fixates, not on the clear language of such directive, but on the two sentences which directly follow: \u201cYou should pay careful attention *1076to each of these factors. Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\u201d According to the majority, these sentences somehow obfuscate the clarity of the court\u2019s instructions.\nWe must look at these instructions in their entirety, however.' The judge instructed,\nI have previously read you a list of aggravating circumstances which the law permits you to consider if you find that any of them is established by the evidence. These are the only aggravating circumstances that you may consider. You are not allowed to take account of any other facts or circumstances as the basis for deciding that the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment in this case.\nHowever, the mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death penalty or a death sentence upon Mr. Bel-montes. You should pay careful attention to each of these factors. Any one of them standing alone may support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\nWhen these instructions are read in context, there is little doubt that the court conveyed the message that the enumerated factors were not the exclusive mitigating circumstances that the jury could consider. The court first instructed the jury how to apply the aggravating circumstances, specifically that it could not consider any non-enumerated factors. The court then contrasted consideration of aggravating factors with mitigating factors, which it noted were merely \u201cexamples of some of the factors\u201d that the jury could consider. The fact that the court further instructed that the jury should consider each of the mitigating factors (recall that \u201cfactors\u201d refers to all mitigating circumstances and not, as the majority implies, to the enumerated circumstances read by the judge) as any one alone might support life in prison, was unlikely to confuse the jury, when viewed in totality.\nThe trial court\u2019s additional instruction reinforced the constitutional requirement of conveying to the jury that it is \u201cnot precluded from considering, and may not refuse to consider, any constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d Buchanan, 522 U.S. at 276, 118 S.Ct. 757 (citations omitted). Instead of confusing the jury, the trial court\u2019s instructions made it clear that all evidence that was presented must be considered. Moreover, the instruction which the majority concludes was \u201ccritical,\u201d supra, at 1065, substantively adds nothing. Rather than speculating that the jury was too dim to understand what it was told by the court, we must presume that the jury understood the instructions taken as a whole. Weeks, 528 U.S. at 234, 120 S.Ct. 727.\nIll\nAccording to the majority, however, it is the series of questions between individual jurors and the judge that proves the jury\u2019s confusion. After the jury deliberated for several hours, it sent the judge a note asking, \u201cWhat happens if we cannot reach a verdict?\u201d and \u201cCan the majority rule on life imprisonment?\u201d The judge refused to tell the jury what would happen if they could not agree, but told them that it would discharge them if they could not reach an agreement. He then asked, \u201cDo you think if I allow you to continue to discuss the matter and for you to go over the instructions again with one another, that the possibility of making a decision is there?\u201d\n*1077At this time, individual jurors asked the judge some questions.\nJUROR HERN: The statement about the aggravation and mitigation of the circumstances, now, that was the listing?\nTHE COURT: That was the listing, yes, ma'am.\nJUROR HERN: Of those certain factors we were to decide one or the other and then balance the sheet?\nTHE COURT: That is right. It is a balancing process.\nJUROR HAILSTONE: Could I ask a question? I don\u2019t know if it is permissible. Is it possible that he could have psychiatric treatment during this time?\nTHE COURT: That is something you cannot consider in making your decision.\nIn the majority\u2019s view, Juror Hern\u2019s use of the term \u201clisting,\u201d and the judge\u2019s failure to note that the \u201clisting\u201d was not exclusive as to mitigating circumstances, shows that individual jurors were confused by the instruction. I respectfully disagree. The jury did not submit a formal question to the judge to indicate that it was confused as to its duties or the instructions, and no informal follow-up questions were asked by any jurors. And while the answers the judge gave the juror might have been cryptic, they were not incorrect. Cf. Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 613, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946).\nMost importantly, just before the judge answered these informal questions, he asked the jury \u201cto go over the instructions again.\u201d Under existing Supreme Court authority, any confusion with regard to its responsibilities would have been cleared up with another such review. See Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 233-34, 120 S.Ct. 727, 145 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (holding that no likelihood of confusion existed when the trial judge referred back to his original instruction when the jury asked a question regarding the instructions themselves). And if, after reviewing the instructions once again, jurors were still confused about the evidence they could consider, they likely would have asked for a formal clarification. See id. at 734 (noting that jury did not submit follow-up question after judge referred it back to the original instructions). While it is possible that after reviewing the instructions again, confusion might have arisen, it was certainly not reasonably likely. See Boyde, 494 U.S. 370, 110 S.Ct. 1190.\nIncredulously, the majority also takes issue with Juror Hailstone\u2019s question regarding whether Belmontes could receive psychiatric treatment while in prison. The court properly instructed the jury that it could not consider such potentially mitigating evidence. And for good reason: no such evidence was ever introduced at any stage of the trial. Indeed, the jury was prohibited from such considerations. See Hughes v. Borg, 898 F.2d 695, 700 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cState defendants have a federal constitutional right to an impartial jury and jurors have a correlative duty to consider only the evidence that is presented in open court.\u201d); see also TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 468, 113 S.Ct. 2711, 125 L.Ed.2d 366 (1993) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\u201cUnlike a legislature, whose judgments may be predicated on educated guesses and need not necessarily be grounded in facts adduced in a hearing, a jury is bound to consider only the evidence presented to it in arriving at a judgment.\u201d).\nThere was absolutely nothing wrong with the trial judge\u2019s instruction that the jury could not consider evidence that was not presented; indeed, it would have been unconstitutional for him to have said otherwise. Yet, the majority ignores such niceties. If the jury were truly confused by *1078the judge\u2019s answer, surely it would have asked a follow-up question of some sort. Nonetheless, without any basis in the record, the majority concludes that the judge\u2019s perfectly proper statement was likely to confuse.\nIV\nThe majority concludes that the jurors listened to all the evidence regarding Bel-montes\u2019s character, listened to the prosecution and the defense tell it to consider such evidence, and listened to the trial court tell it that it must consider all the evidence presented; yet the majority holds that the jury was confused about whether it could consider the evidence presented. Such conclusion, with all due respect, is simply beyond belief; such holding turns the entire proceeding \u201cinto a virtual charade.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 383, 110 S.Ct. 1190 (citation and quote marks omitted).\nThe jury, in reality, returned a death sentence for Belmontes, not because of a confusing jury instruction, but because he murdered nineteen-year-old Steacy McConnell in cold blood, striking her 15-20 times in the head with an iron dumbbell he had brought with him to her house in case of such an encounter; I sincerely doubt the family and friends of Steacy would share the majority\u2019s callous view that her murder was not \u201cespecially heinous.\u201d\nNot surprisingly, the prosecution was able to portray Belmontes as a violent young man by focusing on his past behavior: his armed theft of a loaded handgun, his tendency to carry such a weapon, his fight with another ward while in the CYA after pleading guilty to being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter, and his battery of his pregnant girlfriend, which caused her to drop their two-year-old daughter. It is such violent, anti-social behavior, not an ambiguous jury instruction, that placed him in the situation he now finds himself.\nPerhaps the jury simply did not believe that a convicted murderer might be a particularly good role model to other inmates, despite Reverend Miller\u2019s testimony that Belmontes would be good at counseling other inmates not to repeat his \u201cmistakes.\u201d After all, Steacy\u2019s murder was hardly a \u201cmistake.\u201d Perhaps Belmontes\u2019s jailhouse conversion to Christianity, which mysteriously lapsed as soon as he returned to society, and his ascent to the top of CYA\u2019s fire crew, could rightly have been seen as manipulative ploys to gain early release for his previous crimes.\nBy concluding that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions were unconstitutional, the majority ignores the \u201cstrong policy against retrials years after the first trial where the claimed error .amounts to no more than speculation.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190. There is nothing in the record which would lead me to believe that there was a reasonable probability that the jury was confused about its sentencing duties; therefore I would affirm the denial of the writ as to the penalty phase. I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s refusal to do so.1\n\n. Belmontes also contends that he was deprived of constitutionally effective counsel during the penalty stage of his trial.
