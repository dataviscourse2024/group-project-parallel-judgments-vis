We have jurisdiction. See art. V, \u00a7 2(a), Fla. Const.\n\n      The Committee proposes amending the following existing standard criminal\n\njury instructions: 7.8 (Driving Under the Influence Manslaughter); 7.8(a) (Boating\n\nUnder the Influence Manslaughter); 9.1 (Kidnapping); 9.2 (False Imprisonment);\n\n18.3 (False Information to Law Enforcement); 20.18(a) (Unlawful Possession of\n\nthe Personal Identification Information of Another Person); and 28.18 (Failure to\n\nObey the Lawful Order of a [Police] [Fire] [Traffic] Official). The Committee\n\npublished its proposals for comment in The Florida Bar News. No comments were\n\freceived by the Committee. The Court did not publish the proposals after they\n\nwere filed.\n\n      Having considered the Committee\u2019s report, we authorize amended standard\n\njury instructions 7.8, 7.8(a), 9.1, 9.2, 18.3, and 28.18 for publication and use, with\n\nthe following modifications. In instructions 7.8 and 28.18, the statutory citations\n\nto the definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d are revised to reference the correct statute.\n\n      We decline to authorize amended instruction 20.18(a) as proposed by the\n\nCommittee. The Committee proposes to simplify the explanations of actual\n\npossession, constructive possession, mere proximity, joint possession, inferences\n\nof possession, and exceptions to inferences of possession of personal identification\n\ninformation in instruction 20.18(a) by replacing all of the explanations with what\n\nthe Committee considers a single, simpler explanation of \u201cpossession.\u201d The\n\nCommittee expresses the belief that the existing explanations of the types of\n\npossession and inferences of possession in the instruction are deficient and\n\nconfusing; however, the Court is unaware of any case law that has held the current\n\nexplanations of possession deficient. Deciding such substantive matters is\n\nappropriate for this Court only within the context of an actual case or controversy.\n\nSee art. V, \u00a7 3(b), Fla. Const.; In re Std. Jury Instrs. in Crim. Cases\u2014Report No.\n\n2015-05, 195 So. 3d 1088, 1089 (Fla. 2016). We therefore decline to authorize\n\namended instruction 20.18(a) for publication and use.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      The amended criminal jury instructions, as set forth in the appendix to this\n\nopinion, are hereby authorized for publication and use.1 New language is indicated\n\nby underlining; deleted language is indicated by struck-through type. In\n\nauthorizing the publication and use of these instructions, we express no opinion on\n\ntheir correctness and remind all interested parties that this authorization forecloses\n\nneither requesting additional or alternative instructions nor contesting the legal\n\ncorrectness of the instructions. We further caution all interested parties that any\n\ncomments associated with the instructions reflect only the opinion of the\n\nCommittee and are not necessarily indicative of the views of this Court as to their\n\ncorrectness or applicability. The instructions as set forth in the appendix shall be\n\neffective when this opinion becomes final.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., and PARIENTE, LEWIS, QUINCE, CANADY, and\nPOLSTON, JJ., concur.\nLAWSON, J., did not participate.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION, AND\nIF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\n\n\n       1. The amendments as reflected in the appendix are to the Criminal Jury\nInstructions as they appear on the Court\u2019s website at www.floridasupremecourt.org\n/jury_instructions/instructions.shtml. We recognize that there may be minor\ndiscrepancies between the instructions as they appear on the website and the\npublished versions of the instructions. Any discrepancies as to instructions\nauthorized for publication and use after October 25, 2007, should be resolved by\nreference to the published opinion of this Court authorizing the instruction.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fOriginal Proceeding \u2013 Supreme Court Committee on Standard Jury Instructions in\nCriminal Cases\n\nJudge Frederic Rand Wallis, Chair, Supreme Court Committee on Standard Jury\nInstructions in Criminal Cases, Daytona Beach, Florida; Judge Jerri Lynn Collins,\nPast Chair, Supreme Court Committee on Standard Jury Instructions in Criminal\nCases, Sanford, Florida; and Barton Neil Schneider and Jett Conn, Staff Liaisons,\nOffice of the State Courts Administrator, Tallahassee, Florida,\n\n      for Petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f                                  APPENDIX\n\n       7.8 DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE MANSLAUGHTER\n               \u00a7\u00a7 316.193(3)(a), (3)(b), and (3)(c)3., Fla.

If you find from the evidence that while driving [or in actual\n             physical control of] a motor vehicle, the defendant had a blood or\n             breath-alcohol level of .05 or less, you shall presume that the\n             defendant was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to\n             the extent that [his] [her] normal faculties were impaired; but this\n             presumption may be overcome by other evidence demonstrating\n             that the defendant was under the influence of alcoholic beverages\n             to the extent that [his] [her] normal faculties were impaired.\n\n      2.     If you find from the evidence that while driving [or in actual\n             physical control of] a motor vehicle, the defendant had a blood or\n             breath-alcohol level in excess of .05 but less than .08, that fact\n             does not give rise to any presumption that the defendant was or\n             was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent\n             that [his] [her] normal faculties were impaired. In such cases, you\n             may consider that evidence along with other evidence in\n             determining whether the defendant was under the influence of\n             alcoholic beverages to the extent that [his] [her] normal faculties\n             were impaired.\n\n      3.     If you find from the evidence that while driving or in actual\n             physical control of a motor vehicle, the defendant had a blood or\n             breath-alcohol level of .08 or more, that evidence would be\n             sufficient by itself to establish that the defendant was under the\n             influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that [his] [her]\n             normal faculties were impaired. But this evidence may be\n             contradicted or rebutted by other evidence demonstrating that the\n             defendant was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to\n             the extent that [his] [her] normal faculties were impaired.\n\n       It is not necessary to instruct on the \u201cprima facie evidence of impairment\u201d\nin \u00a7 316.1934(2)(c), Fla. Stat., if the State charged the defendant with driving with\na blood or breath-alcohol level of .08 or over. In those cases, if the jury finds that\nthe defendant drove with an unlawful blood or breath-alcohol level, impairment\nbecomes moot. Tyner v. State, 805 So. 2d 862 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f      Defense of inoperability; give if applicable.\n      It is a defense to the charge of Driving under the Influence\nManslaughter if at the time of the alleged offense, the vehicle was inoperable.\nHowever, it is not a defense if the defendant was driving under the influence\nbefore the vehicle became inoperable. Therefore, if you are not convinced\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the vehicle was operable at the time of the\nalleged offense, you should find the defendant not guilty. However, if you are\nconvinced that the vehicle was operable at the time of the alleged offense, then\nyou should find the defendant guilty, if all the other elements of the charge\nhave been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                           Lesser Included Offenses\n\nDRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE MANSLAUGHTER \u2014 316.193(3)(A),\n                       (3)(B), AND (3)(C)3.\nCATEGORY ONE      CATEGORY TWO FLA.
