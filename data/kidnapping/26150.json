In 2008, a jury convicted Mr.\n\nUnderwood of first degree murder and sentenced him to death in Oklahoma state court.\n\fThe Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\nconviction and sentence and later denied post-conviction relief.\n\n       Mr. Underwood sought federal habeas relief from his death sentence under \u00a7 2254.\n\nThe federal district court denied Mr. Underwood\u2019s requests for relief and for a certificate\n\nof appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on all eleven grounds raised in the \u00a7 2254 application. We\n\ngranted COAs on six of the eleven grounds for relief.\n\n       Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, we affirm the district\n\ncourt\u2019s denial of habeas relief on all six grounds.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       We begin with the relevant factual history as presented by the OCCA.1 We then\n\nprovide an overview of the procedural history leading to this appeal. We present\n\nadditional background below as relevant to our discussion of Mr. Underwood\u2019s claims.\n\n                                    A. Factual History\n\n       The OCCA, in addressing Mr. Underwood\u2019s direct appeal, set forth the following\n\nrelevant facts:\n\n              [Mr. Underwood] was charged with murdering ten-year-old\n              [J.B.] on April 12, 2006, in Purcell, Oklahoma. [Mr.\n              Underwood] lived alone in the same apartment complex\n              where [J.B.] lived with her father, Curtis Bolin. Due to her\n              father\u2019s work schedule, [J.B.] was typically home alone for a\n\n       1\n         See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (\u201c[A] determination of a factual issue made by a State\ncourt shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting\nthe presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d); see also Al-Yousif v.\nTrani, 779 F.3d 1173, 1181 (10th Cir. 2015) (\u201cThe presumption of correctness also\napplies to factual findings made by a state court of review based on the trial record.\u201d\n(quotations omitted)).\n\n\n                                               2\n\fperiod of time after school. On the day in question, [J.B.]\nplayed in the school library with a friend for a short time\nbefore going home. She was never seen alive again.\n\nPolice, firefighters, and a host of citizen volunteers began a\nsearch for [J.B.]. The day after [J.B.]\u2019s disappearance, the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation [the \u201cFBI\u201d] added over two\ndozen people to the effort. On April 14, 2006, two days after\n[J.B.] was last seen, police set up several roadblocks around\nthe apartment complex where she lived, seeking leads from\nlocal motorists. Around 3:45 p.m. that day, FBI Agent Craig\nOverby encountered a truck driven by [Mr. Underwood]\u2019s\nfather at one of the roadblocks; [Mr. Underwood] was a\npassenger in the truck. [Mr. Underwood]\u2019s father told\nOverby that they had heard about the disappearance, and that\nin fact, [Mr. Underwood] was the girl\u2019s neighbor. From\nspeaking with other neighbors at the apartment complex,\nOverby knew that a young man living there may have been\nthe last person to see [J.B.]. Overby asked if [Mr.\nUnderwood] would come to the patrol car to talk for a\nmoment, and [Mr. Underwood] agreed, while his father\nwaited in the truck. In the patrol car, [Mr. Underwood] made\nstatements that piqued Overby\u2019s interest.[] Overby asked [Mr.\nUnderwood] if he would come to the police station for\nadditional questioning. Again, [Mr. Underwood] agreed, and\nOverby assured [Mr. Underwood]\u2019s father that he (Overby)\nwould give [Mr. Underwood] a ride home.\n\nAt the police station, [Mr. Underwood] was interviewed by\nAgent Overby and Agent Martin Maag. [Mr. Underwood]\ntold them about seeing [J.B.] on April 12, and discussed his\nactivities on that day and other matters. At the conclusion of\nthis interview, which lasted less than an hour, the agents\nasked [Mr. Underwood] if they could search his apartment.\n[Mr. Underwood] agreed. The agents accompanied [Mr.\nUnderwood] to his apartment around 5:00 p.m. While\nlooking around the apartment, Overby saw a large plastic\nstorage tub in [Mr. Underwood]\u2019s closet; its lid was sealed\nwith duct tape. [Mr. Underwood] saw Overby looking at the\ntub, and volunteered that he kept comic books in it; he said\nthat he had taped the lid to keep moisture out. Overby asked\nif he could look inside the tub, and [Mr. Underwood] agreed.\nWhen Overby pulled back a portion of the tape and lifted a\n\n\n                                3\n\fcorner of the lid, he saw a girl\u2019s shirt\u2014and realized that it\nmatched [Mr. Underwood]\u2019s description of the shirt [J.B.]\nwas wearing on the day she disappeared.[] When Overby\ncommented that he saw no comic books in the tub, [Mr.\nUnderwood] interjected, \u201cGo ahead and arrest me.\u201d Overby\nimmediately responded, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d [Mr. Underwood]\nreplied, \u201cShe\u2019s in there. I hit her and chopped her up.\u201d [Mr.\nUnderwood] then became visibly upset, began\nhyperventilating, and exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m going to burn in Hell.\u201d\nHe was placed under arrest and escorted out to the agents\u2019\nvehicle. Agent Overby summoned local authorities to secure\nthe scene.\n\nBack at the police station, [Mr. Underwood] was advised of\nhis right to remain silent, and his right to the assistance of\ncounsel during any questioning, consistent with Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).\nBecause he asked for a lawyer, the interview was concluded.\nAbout fifteen minutes later (approximately 5:45 p.m.), police\napproached [Mr. Underwood] and asked if he would reaffirm,\nin writing, his original verbal consent to a search of his\napartment. [Mr. Underwood] agreed, and spent the next few\nhours sitting in a police lieutenant\u2019s office. He conversed\nwith various officers who were sent to guard him, and made\nsome incriminating statements during that time.\n\nAround 9:30 p.m. that evening, [Mr. Underwood] asked to\nspeak with the two FBI agents he had initially talked to\n(Overby and Maag). Because [Mr. Underwood] had\npreviously asked for counsel, [Oklahoma State Bureau of\nInvestigation (\u201cOSBI\u201d)] Agent Lydia Williams visited with\nhim to determine his intentions. Agent Williams reminded\n[Mr. Underwood] that he had earlier declined to be\nquestioned, and explained that because of that decision,\npolice could not question him any further. [Mr. Underwood]\nemphatically replied that he wanted to talk to the agents.\nAround 10:15 p.m., Agents Overby and Maag interviewed\n[Mr. Underwood] at the police station. Before questioning\nbegan, Overby reminded [Mr. Underwood] of his Miranda\nrights, and [Mr. Underwood] signed a written form\nacknowledging that he understood them and waived them.\nWhen asked if anyone had offered him anything in exchange\nfor agreeing to talk, [Mr. Underwood] replied that one of the\n\n\n                               4\n\fofficers had predicted things would go better for him if he\ncooperated. Besides acknowledging his waiver of Miranda\nrights, [Mr. Underwood] also signed another written consent\nto a search of his apartment. A video recording and transcript\nof the interview that followed, which lasted about an hour,\nwas presented to the jury at trial and is included in the record\non appeal.\n\nIn the interview, [Mr. Underwood] describes how he had\nrecently developed a desire to abduct a person, sexually\nmolest them, eat their flesh, and dispose of their remains. He\nexplains in considerable detail how he attempted to carry out\nthis plan on [J.B.], whom he had decided was a convenient\nvictim. [Mr. Underwood] stated that he invited [J.B.] into his\napartment to play with his pet rat. Once [J.B.] was inside,\n[Mr. Underwood] hit her on the back of the head several\ntimes with a wooden cutting board; she screamed in pain and\nbegged him to stop. [Mr. Underwood] proceeded to suffocate\nthe girl by sitting on her and placing his hand across her face.\n[Mr. Underwood] told the agents that this was not an easy\ntask, and that fifteen to twenty minutes passed before she\nsuccumbed. [Mr. Underwood] claimed he then attempted to\nhave sexual relations with the girl\u2019s body, but was unable to\nperform. He then moved her body to the bathtub and\nattempted to decapitate it with a knife, but was unsuccessful\nat that task as well. Frustrated, [Mr. Underwood] wrapped\n[J.B.]\u2019s body in plastic sheeting and placed it in a large plastic\ncontainer which he hid in his closet. [Mr. Underwood] also\ndismantled [J.B.]\u2019s bicycle and hid it inside his apartment, to\nmake it look as if she had left the apartment complex.\n\n[J.B.]\u2019s remains were taken to the Medical Examiner\u2019s office\nfor an autopsy. The Medical Examiner noted bruises to the\nback of the girl\u2019s head, consistent with [Mr. Underwood]\u2019s\nclaim that he hit her forcefully with a cutting board. The\nexaminer also noted petechia in the girl\u2019s eyes, and curved\nmarks on her face, consistent with [Mr. Underwood]\u2019s\ndescription of how he had suffocated her. The most\npronounced wound on the body was a very deep incision to\n[J.B.]\u2019s neck, which was also consistent with the injuries [Mr.\nUnderwood] admitted to inflicting. The Medical Examiner\nalso noted trauma to the girl\u2019s genital area, including tearing\nof the hymen. However, the Medical Examiner could not say\n\n\n                                 5\n\f              that [J.B.] was alive, or even conscious, when her neck was\n              cut or when she was sexually assaulted. The official cause of\n              death was declared to be asphyxiation.\n\nUnderwood v. State, 252 P.3d 221, 230-31 (Okla. Crim. App. 2011) (footnotes omitted).\n\n                                   B. Procedural History\n\n       The following proceedings preceded Mr. Underwood\u2019s present appeal: (1) jury\n\ntrial in Oklahoma state court, (2) direct appeal and application for state post-conviction\n\nrelief in the OCCA, and (3) application for federal post-conviction relief in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma under \u00a7 2254. We provide a\n\nbrief overview of each proceeding.\n\n1. Trial\n\n       In 2008, an Oklahoma jury convicted Mr. Underwood of first degree murder,\n\nunder Section 701.7(A) of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, and sentenced him to death.\n\n       In the guilt stage, the jury found the evidence sufficient to establish that Mr.\n\nUnderwood murdered J.B. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 229. Although Mr. Underwood \u201cdid\n\nnot formally concede his guilt . . . , but instead required the State to present its evidence\n\non that issue, neither did he seriously contest the guilt-stage evidence against him.\u201d Id. at\n\n232. \u201cIn fact, defense counsel told the jury in guilt-stage opening statements that it\n\nwould probably find [Mr. Underwood] guilty, but that there would be reasons to spare his\n\nlife.\u201d Id. The guilt evidence presented to the jury included a video recording and printed\n\ntranscript of Mr. Underwood\u2019s interview with the FBI agents, during which he had\n\nconfessed to the murder. Id. at 238.\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       In the punishment stage, the same jury found one aggravating circumstance and\n\nrecommended the death penalty after weighing it against any mitigating circumstances\n\nestablished at trial. Id. at 229-30, 246. In its aggravation case, the State put evidence of\n\ntwo aggravating circumstances before the jury: (1) the murder was especially heinous,\n\natrocious, or cruel (the \u201cHAC\u201d aggravator); and (2) Mr. Underwood posed a continuing\n\nthreat to society (the \u201ccontinuing threat\u201d aggravator). Id. at 230 n.1. The jury found the\n\nexistence of the HAC aggravator but not the continuing threat aggravator. Id. at 232. In\n\nhis mitigation case, Mr. Underwood presented \u201cextensive evidence . . . , including the\n\ntestimony of family, friends, and three experts who had evaluated [his] mental health.\u201d\n\nId. The jury recommended the death sentence, which the trial court imposed. Id. at 230.\n\n2. Direct Appeal and Application for State Post-Conviction Relief\n\n       Mr. Underwood appealed to the OCCA, raising a variety of trial errors, including\n\nthe six grounds for relief before us in this appeal. In 2011, the OCCA affirmed Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s conviction and sentence. Id. at 258.2 The court also performed a\n\nstatutorily mandated sentencing review and concluded that \u201cthe evidence was sufficient\n\nto support the one aggravating circumstance found by the jury\u201d and that no \u201cimproper\n\nfactor\u201d influenced the jury\u2019s imposition of the death sentence. Id. Mr. Underwood then\n\napplied for post-conviction relief, which the OCCA denied in an unpublished summary\n\nopinion in 2012.\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Supreme Court denied Mr. Underwood\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.\nUnderwood v. Oklahoma, 565 U.S. 1121 (2012).\n\n\n                                               7\n\f3. Application for Federal Post-Conviction Relief under \u00a7 2254\n\n       In 2013, Mr. Underwood filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.\n\nThe petition presented eleven grounds for relief, including the six before us in this appeal.\n\nThe district court denied relief on all eleven grounds. See Underwood v. Duckworth,\n\n2016 WL 4059162 (W.D. Okla. July 28, 2016). It also denied a COA on all grounds.\n\nSee Underwood v. Duckworth, 2016 WL 4120772 (W.D. Okla. July 28, 2016).\n\n       Mr. Underwood appealed, and this court granted COAs on six of Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s grounds for relief, which we address below.\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n\n       We begin with our standard of review. We then analyze the six grounds for relief\n\non which we have granted COA: (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel, (2)\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, (3) improper jury instruction and prosecutor statements on\n\nmitigating evidence, (4) admission of unconstitutional victim impact testimony, (5)\n\nimposition of the death penalty without a jury finding that the HAC aggravator\n\noutweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, and (6) cumulative\n\nerror. We conclude that Mr. Underwood is not entitled to relief on any of these grounds.\n\nThroughout our discussion, we provide additional background information as needed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f                                  A. Standard of Review\n\n       \u201cOur review is . . . governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\nof 1996 (\u2018AEDPA\u2019), which requires federal courts to give significant deference to state\n\ncourt decisions.\u201d Lockett v. Trammel, 711 F.3d 1218, 1230 (10th Cir. 2013).3\n\n       Under AEDPA, when a state court has decided a claim on the merits, we must\n\ndefer to the court\u2019s adjudication of the claim unless it:\n\n              (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n                  unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n                  law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n                  States; or\n\n              (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\n                  determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n                  presented in the State court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).4\n\n       Section 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u201ccontrary to\u201d and \u201cunreasonable application of\u201d language\n\ndenotes two distinct inquiries. \u201cAn OCCA decision is \u2018contrary to\u2019 a clearly established\n\nlaw if it applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in Supreme Court cases,\n\nor if it decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has done on a set of materially\n\n\n       3\n        \u201cAEDPA concerns federal court deference to the decisions of state courts. Our\nreview of the federal district court\u2019s application of AEDPA is de novo.\u201d Murphy v.\nRoyal, 875 F.3d 896, 913 n.20 (10th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, No. 17-1107, 2018 WL\n747674 (U.S. May 21, 2018).\n       4\n         AEDPA additionally provides that \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a\nState court shall be presumed to be correct\u201d and that \u201c[t]he applicant shall have the\nburden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). In addressing Mr. Underwood\u2019s challenges to the OCCA\u2019s\nfactual determinations in our discussion below, we apply the \u00a7 2254(d)(2) standard, but\nhis arguments would likewise fail under \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\n\n                                                9\n\findistinguishable facts.\u201d Lockett, 711 F.3d at 1231 (alterations and quotations omitted);\n\nsee also Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694 (2002). \u201cAn OCCA decision is an\n\n\u2018unreasonable application\u2019 of clearly established federal law if it identifies the correct\n\ngoverning legal principle . . . but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of\n\npetitioner\u2019s case.\u201d Lockett, 711 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted); see also Bell, 535 U.S.\n\nat 694.\n\n          \u201cIf a claim was not resolved by the state courts on the merits and is not otherwise\n\nprocedurally barred, . . . \u00a7 2254(d) . . . do[es] not apply . . . , [and] we review the [federal]\n\ndistrict court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings, if any, for clear error.\u201d\n\nCole v. Trammell, 755 F.3d 1142, 1148 (10th Cir. 2014).\n\n                                 B. The Six Issues on Appeal\n\n          Having presented our standard of review, we now address each of the six grounds\n\nfor relief on which we have granted COA: (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel, (2)\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, (3) improper jury instruction and prosecutor statements on\n\nmitigating evidence, (4) admission of unconstitutional victim impact testimony, (5)\n\nimposition of the death penalty without a jury finding that the HAC aggravator\n\noutweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, and (6) cumulative\n\nerror.\n\n1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n          Mr. Underwood contends that he is entitled to relief from his death sentence based\n\non his trial counsel\u2019s failure to present expert rebuttal testimony relating to the timing of\n\nJ.B.\u2019s death. The OCCA rejected this claim on the merits. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 252.\n\n\n                                                10\n\f       In addressing this claim, we begin with the relevant legal background and\n\nadditional factual and procedural background. We then examine the OCCA\u2019s merits\n\ndecision under \u00a7 2254(d) and conclude that it was not contrary to\u2014or an unreasonable\n\napplication of\u2014Supreme Court law or based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\nineffective assistance claim.5\n\n       a. Legal background\n\n       We first discuss the general framework set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668 (1984), to address ineffective assistance claims. We then focus on the deficient\n\nperformance part of the test, which guides our analysis below.\n\n              i. Overview\n\n       \u201cThe Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes\n\na right to effective representation.\u201d Frost v. Pryor, 749 F.3d 1212, 1224 (10th Cir. 2014);\n\nsee also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686. Counsel can \u201cdeprive a defendant of the right to\n\neffective assistance . . . by failing to render adequate legal assistance.\u201d Strickland, 466\n\n\n       5\n         Mr. Underwood also sought\u2014and was denied\u2014an evidentiary hearing on the\nineffective assistance claim in both the OCCA and federal district court. See Underwood,\n252 P.3d at 250; Underwood, 2016 WL 4059162, at *33. Mr. Underwood asserts on\nappeal that \u201cthe district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing [on the ineffective\nassistance claim] was error.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 25. We decline to address this issue because it\nis inadequately briefed. See Leathers v. Leathers, 856 F.3d 729, 751 (10th Cir. 2017).\n       In any event, the Supreme Court has held \u201cthat review under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the\nmerits.\u201d Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181 (2011). As discussed above, Mr.\nUnderwood cannot overcome \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on the record that was before the OCCA with\nrespect to his ineffective assistance claim. Accordingly, the \u201cdistrict court [was] not\nrequired to hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Id. at 183 (quotations omitted).\n\n                                               11\n\fU.S. at 686 (quotations omitted). To establish a violation under Strickland, a habeas\n\npetitioner must show that (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d Id. at 687. Because we rely only on\n\ndeficient performance to resolve this case, we restrict our discussion accordingly. See\n\nHooks v. Workman, 689 F.3d 1148, 1186 (10th Cir. 2012) (\u201cThese two prongs may be\n\naddressed in any order, and failure to satisfy either is dispositive.\u201d).\n\n              ii. Deficient performance\n\n       To establish constitutionally deficient performance, \u201cthe defendant must show that\n\ncounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 688. \u201c[T]he defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the\n\ncircumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d Id. at 689\n\n(quotations omitted). In other words, counsel\u2019s performance \u201cmust have been completely\n\nunreasonable, not merely wrong.\u201d Boyd v. Ward, 179 F.3d 904, 914 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n\u201cEvery effort must be made to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the\n\ntime.\u201d Littlejohn v. Trammell, 704 F.3d 817, 859 (10th Cir. 2013) (quotations omitted).\n\n\u201cHowever, while we entertain a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within\n\nthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance, we nevertheless apply closer\n\nscrutiny when reviewing attorney performance during the sentencing phase of a capital\n\ncase.\u201d Id. (citations and quotations omitted).\n\n       b. Relevant facts\n\n       In his interview with the FBI agents, Mr. Underwood described J.B.\u2019s murder. He\n\ntold them he had \u201chit [J.B.] on the back of the head several times with a wooden cutting\n\n\n                                               12\n\fboard\u201d and that she had \u201cscreamed in pain and begged him to stop.\u201d Underwood, 252\n\nP.3d at 231. He stated that he had \u201csuffocate[d] [J.B.] by sitting on her and placing his\n\nhand across her face\u201d and that \u201cfifteen to twenty minutes passed before she succumbed.\u201d\n\nId. He \u201cclaimed he then attempted to have sexual relations with the girl\u2019s body, but was\n\nunable to perform[,] . . . and attempted to decapitate it with a knife, but was unsuccessful\n\nat that task as well.\u201d Id.\n\n       During the guilt stage of Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial, Dr. Inas Yacoub, the Medical\n\nExaminer, testified for the State regarding the possibility that J.B. had survived Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s attempt to suffocate her and was still alive or even conscious when he then\n\nattempted to sexually assault and decapitate her. Dr. Yacoub had previously performed\n\nJ.B.\u2019s autopsy and determined that J.B. died from \u201casphyxiation.\u201d Id. at 231, 251. At\n\ntrial, Dr. Yacoub testified that the injuries observed in J.B.\u2019s genital area and on her neck\n\nmay have occurred while she was still alive and even conscious. Trial Tr. Vol. VII at\n\n1174-78, 1817-19. On cross-examination, trial counsel for Mr. Underwood elicited Dr.\n\nYacoub\u2019s acknowledgement that she could not determine with scientific certainty at what\n\npoint J.B. lost consciousness. Id. at 1817-19.\n\n       In the punishment stage of Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial, the State \u201cincorporated the\n\ntestimony from the guilt stage to show that the murder was especially, heinous, atrocious,\n\nor cruel.\u201d Underwood, 252 P.3d at 232.6 In closing argument, the State referenced Dr.\n\n\n\n       6\n        Under Oklahoma law, the HAC aggravator is one of several aggravating\ncircumstances that, if found beyond a reasonable doubt, enables the imposition of the\ndeath penalty. Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 701.11, 701.12. The HAC aggravator showing\n\n                                              13\n\fYacoub\u2019s testimony to support its theory that J.B. experienced conscious physical\n\nsuffering before her death: \u201cAnd the medical examiner told you there was probably\u2014\n\nthere\u2019s a possibility that there was more that preceded her last breath. And when she\n\ntalks about the injuries to her vagina, and she talks about the injuries to her throat . . . .\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that preceded her last breath.\u201d Trial Tr. Vol. X at 2553-54.\n\n       Before trial, Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial counsel \u201chad retained [a] forensic pathologist,\n\nDr. John Adams, to review the autopsy findings.\u201d Underwood, 252 P.3d at 251. But trial\n\ncounsel never called Dr. Adams to testify. Id.\n\n       c. OCCA and federal district court decisions\n\n       In his appeal to the OCCA, Mr. Underwood argued that trial counsel\u2019s failure to\n\ncall Dr. Adams to rebut Ms. Yacoub\u2019s testimony constituted reversible error. Id. at 250.\n\nHe submitted a sworn affidavit, secured by appellate counsel, in which Dr. Adams stated\n\nhis expert opinion that J.B. could not have been alive during the attempted decapitation.\n\nDefendant\u2019s Appeal Exhibit A. Dr. Adams based his conclusion in part on his\n\nobservation that the crime scene photographs showed very little blood spatter, whereas\n\n\u201cwidespread[] [blood spatter] would support a theory of antemortem injury.\u201d Id. at 3-4.\n\nThe OCCA denied Mr. Underwood\u2019s ineffective assistance claim on the merits,\n\n\u201cdiscern[ing] sound strategic reasons for the defense team not calling its forensic\n\npathologist, and . . . find[ing] no prejudice flowing from that decision.\u201d Underwood, 252\n\n\n\n\nrequires \u201cevidence of conscious physical suffering of the victim prior to death.\u201d Cheney\nv. State, 909 P.2d 74, 80 (Okla. Crim. App. 1995) (emphasis added) (quotations omitted).\n\n                                                14\n\fP.3d at 253. Mr. Underwood then sought federal habeas relief, which the district court\n\ndenied. Underwood, 2016 WL 4059162, at *13.\n\n       d. Analysis\n\n       We review the OCCA\u2019s decision under \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (d)(2) and conclude that\n\nit was not contrary to\u2014or an unreasonable application of\u2014clearly established Supreme\n\nCourt law or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. Although the OCCA\n\naddressed both deficient performance and prejudice in its Strickland analysis, our\n\nanalysis begins and ends with the former ground, which alone provides a sufficient basis\n\nfor denying relief. See Hooks, 689 F.3d at 1186 (\u201c[F]ailure to satisfy either [Strickland\n\nprong] is dispositive.\u201d).\n\n              i. Section 2254(d)(1): Reasonableness of legal determinations\n\n       The OCCA\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Adams\u2019s affidavit did not overcome the\n\npresumption of sound trial strategy was consistent with and a reasonable application of\n\nStrickland. In determining whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, \u201c[e]very effort\n\nmust be made to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d Littlejohn,\n\n704 F.3d at 859 (quotations omitted). Here, the OCCA reasonably evaluated the value of\n\nDr. Adams\u2019s rebuttal testimony from trial counsel\u2019s perspective and determined it \u201cmight\n\nhave done more harm than good.\u201d Underwood, 252 P.3d at 252.\n\n       As the OCCA reasoned, Dr. Adams\u2019s testimony would have had no relevance in\n\nthe guilt stage and, in the punishment stage, could have drawn the jury\u2019s attention away\n\nfrom Mr. Underwood\u2019s affirmative mitigation case and back to the \u201cgruesome\u201d details of\n\nthe crime. Id. For example, Dr. Adams based his conclusion that J.B. was already\n\n\n                                             15\n\fdeceased at the time of the attempted decapitation in part on the absence of widespread\n\nblood spatter, as captured in the crime scene photographs. He also noted that \u201ca massive\n\nexsanguination,\u201d or loss of blood, would support the possibility that J.B. was alive during\n\nthe attempted decapitation. Defendant\u2019s Appeal Exhibit A at 3-4. But in his confession,\n\nMr. Underwood had stated that, when he started cutting J.B.\u2019s neck, \u201c[he] couldn\u2019t\n\nbelieve the amount of blood that came out.\u201d State\u2019s Trial Exhibit 162 at 69. Had Dr.\n\nAdams testified, the prosecution likely would have questioned him on cross-examination\n\nabout this statement. This line of questioning could potentially have discredited Dr.\n\nAdams\u2019s conclusions and \u201cwould arguably have distracted the jury in a way unfavorable\n\nto the defense.\u201d Underwood, 252 P.3d at 252.\n\n       We acknowledge Mr. Underwood\u2019s concern about the emotional impact of Dr.\n\nYacoub\u2019s unrebutted testimony on the jury, and we may even disagree with trial\n\ncounsel\u2019s challenged course of action here. But under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard, we\n\ncannot conclude that the OCCA unreasonably applied Strickland in determining that trial\n\ncounsel\u2019s strategy was at least reasonable.\n\n              ii. Section 2254(d)(2): Reasonableness of factual determinations\n\n       Mr. Underwood contends that the OCCA based its conclusion\u2014that Dr. Adams\u2019s\n\naffidavit failed to overcome the presumption of sound trial strategy\u2014on unreasonable\n\nfactual determinations under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) because it \u201ccompletely disregarded [Dr.]\n\nYacoub\u2019s key prejudicial testimony\u201d and \u201cignored Dr. Adams\u2019s conclusive condemnation\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fof [her] alternate theories.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 24.7 We need not decide whether \u00a7 2254(d)(2),\n\nrather than \u00a7 2254(d)(1), supplies the appropriate standard of review.8 Under either\n\nstandard, Mr. Underwood\u2019s argument fails for the same reason\u2014the OCCA did not\n\ndisregard Dr. Yacoub\u2019s testimony. Rather, the OCCA observed that her testimony was\n\n\u201cinconclusive\u201d and reasoned that it arguably related to \u201ca collateral matter.\u201d Underwood,\n\n252 P.3d at 252. Likewise, the OCCA did not disregard the testimony Dr. Adams was\n\nprepared to offer. Instead, the OCCA reasonably determined, as discussed above, that\n\nDr. Adams\u2019s testimony \u201cmight have done more harm than good.\u201d Id.\n\n2. Prosecutorial Misconduct\u2014Arguing Facts Not in Evidence\n\n       Mr. Underwood contends that he is entitled to relief from his death sentence based\n\non the State\u2019s closing argument in both stages of the trial that the evidence established he\n\nhad shaved J.B.\u2019s pubic region with a razor. The OCCA rejected this claim on the merits.\n\nUnderwood, 252 P.3d at 249.\n\n       In addressing this claim, we begin with the relevant legal background and\n\nadditional factual and procedural background. We assume without deciding that the\n\nOCCA\u2019s decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts under\n\n       7\n        This specific argument does not appear in Mr. Underwood\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. In\nany event, as we explain below, it lacks merit.\n       8\n         We have previously said: \u201cIt is clear that, where the state courts plainly\nmisapprehend or misstate the record in making their findings, and the misapprehension\ngoes to a material factual issue that is central to petitioner\u2019s claim, that misapprehension\ncan fatally undermine the fact-finding process, rendering the resulting factual finding\nunreasonable [under \u00a7 2254(d)(2)].\u201d Byrd v. Workman, 645 F.3d 1159, 1171\u201372 (10th\nCir. 2011) (quotations omitted). But Mr. Underwood argues that the OCCA\ndisregarded\u2014as opposed to misapprehended or misstated\u2014Dr. Yacoub\u2019s testimony and\nDr. Adams\u2019s affidavit.\n\n                                              17\n\f\u00a72254(d)(2). We therefore review the issue de novo and conclude that Mr. Underwood is\n\nnot entitled to relief because he has not shown the alleged error violated his due process.\n\nWe affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Mr. Underwood\u2019s prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct claim.\n\n       a. Legal background\n\n       We first provide a general overview of prosecutorial misconduct standards and the\n\nframework under Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 645 (1974), for determining when\n\nprosecutorial misconduct warrants reversal of state court convictions and sentences. We\n\nthen focus on case law regarding prosecutorial argument of facts not in evidence, the type\n\nof misconduct alleged here.\n\n              i. Overview\n\n       The Supreme Court has \u201ccounselled prosecutors \u2018to refrain from improper\n\nmethods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction [or sentence].\u2019\u201d United States v.\n\nYoung, 470 U.S. 1, 7 (1985) (alterations omitted) (quoting Berger v. United States, 295\n\nU.S. 78, 88 (1935)); see Le v. Mullin, 311 F.3d 1002, 1018 (10th Cir. 2002). Although\n\n\u201cthe adversary system permits the prosecutor to . . . \u2018strike hard blows, he is not at liberty\n\nto strike foul ones.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Berger, 295 U.S. at 88).\n\n       Prosecutorial misconduct does not necessarily result in constitutional error\n\nwarranting habeas relief. \u201cGenerally, there are two ways in which prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct . . . can result in constitutional error.\u201d Littlejohn, 704 F.3d at 837. \u201cFirst, it\n\ncan prejudice a specific right as to amount to a denial of that right.\u201d Id. (alterations and\n\nquotations omitted). \u201cAdditionally, absent infringement of a specific constitutional right,\n\n\n                                               18\n\fa prosecutor\u2019s misconduct may in some instances render a habeas petitioner\u2019s trial \u2018so\n\nfundamentally unfair as to deny him due process.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Donnelly, 416 U.S. at\n\n645). \u201cThis determination may be made only after considering all of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances, including the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d Malicoat v. Mullin, 426 F.3d\n\n1241, 1255 (10th Cir. 2005). The fundamental unfairness test applies to instances of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct occurring in either the guilt or sentencing stage of trial.\n\nSmallwood v. Gibson, 191 F.3d 1257, 1275-76 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n              ii. Arguing facts not in evidence\n\n       Although \u201c[a] prosecutor may comment on and draw reasonable inferences from\n\nevidence presented at trial,\u201d Thornburg v. Mullin, 422 F.3d 1113, 1131 (10th Cir. 2005),\n\narguing \u201cprejudicial facts not in evidence\u201d is one type of prosecutorial misconduct. See\n\nBerger, 295 U.S. at 84. As with other types of prosecutorial misconduct, \u201c[t]he line\n\nseparating acceptable from improper advocacy is not easily drawn; there is often a gray\n\nzone.\u201d Young, 470 U.S. at 7.\n\n       b. Relevant facts\n\n       In closing argument in both stages of Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial, the State interpreted\n\nthe evidence as showing that Mr. Underwood had shaved J.B.\u2019s pubic region with a razor.\n\nTrial Tr. Vol. VII at 1853-54 (guilt stage); Trial Tr. Vol. X at 2522, 2554 (punishment\n\nstage). The evidence included a photograph of Mr. Underwood\u2019s home, taken by law\n\nenforcement, depicting a blue object on a desk. State\u2019s Trial Exhibit 90. The evidence\n\nalso included the testimony of Jolene Russell, an OSBI criminalist. Ms. Russell, after\n\nidentifying the blue object in the photograph as an \u201celectric razor,\u201d had recalled the\n\n\n                                              19\n\ffollowing observations \u201cabout [J.B.]\u2019s vaginal area at the morgue when the body [was]\n\nbeing processed\u201d: (1) \u201cloose hairs around the pubic region,\u201d (2) \u201c[attached] pubic hair in\n\nthe vaginal area,\u201d and (3) what appeared to be a \u201cclean\u201d area above the vaginal area.\n\nTrial Tr. Vol. VI at 1522. Finally, the evidence included the testimony of Dr. Yacoub,\n\nwho recalled removing \u201ca hair from the pubic area\u201d during J.B.\u2019s autopsy but did not\n\notherwise comment on the presence or absence of hair in that area. Trial Tr. Vol. VII at\n\n1760.\n\n        c. OCCA and federal district court decisions\n\n        In his appeal to the OCCA, Mr. Underwood argued that the prosecution\u2019s remarks\n\nconstituted reversible error. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 249.9 The OCCA denied Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim on the merits, determining that the\n\nprosecution\u2019s remarks (1) were not improper, because they were \u201creasonably based on\n\nthe evidence,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhile [they] may have, to some degree, underscored the vile\n\nnature of the entire crime, [they] did not unfairly overshadow the other depraved things\n\n[Mr. Underwood] freely admitted to doing.\u201d Id. In its discussion of this claim, the\n\nOCCA stated that \u201c[Ms.] Russell noticed that the girl\u2019s pubic area appeared partially\n\nshaven.\u201d Id. Mr. Underwood then sought federal habeas relief, arguing the OCCA had\n\nmisstated the evidence, and the district court denied relief. Underwood, 2016 WL\n\n4059162, at *23.\n\n\n\n        9\n         Because the State allocated different portions of the closing arguments to two\ndifferent prosecutors, we designate them jointly as \u201cthe prosecution.\u201d\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       d. Analysis\n\n       As previously explained, we review the Mr. Underwood\u2019s prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct claim de novo and conclude that he is not entitled to habeas because he has\n\nnot shown the alleged error violated his due process under Donnelly.10 Mr. Underwood\n\ncontends that the OCCA \u201cblatant[ly] misstate[d]\u201d the evidence \u201cwhen it said \u2018[Ms.]\n\nRussell noticed that the girl\u2019s pubic area appeared partially shaven.\u2019\u201d Aplt. Br. at 40\n\n(quoting Underwood, 252 P.3d at 249). We need not decide whether Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\nargument overcomes AEDPA deference. Even assuming we must review the\n\nprosecutorial misconduct claim de novo, he is not entitled to habeas relief. Based on our\n\nindependent review of the record, we agree with the OCCA\u2019s determination that the\n\nalleged prosecutorial misconduct\u2014the remarks about shaving\u2014\u201cdid not unfairly\n\novershadow the other depraved things [Mr. Underwood] freely admitted to doing\u201d in his\n\nconfession. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 249. The remarks therefore did not render his trial\n\n\u201cso fundamentally unfair as to deny him due process.\u201d Donnelly, 416 U.S. at 645.\n\n3. Jury Instruction and Prosecutorial Argument on Mitigating Evidence\n\n       Mr. Underwood contends that he is entitled to relief from his death sentence\n\nbecause one of the punishment stage jury instructions, and the State\u2019s use of it in closing\n\narguments, unconstitutionally limited the jury\u2019s consideration of the mitigating evidence.\n\nThe challenged instruction\u2014Instruction No. 12\u2014defined \u201c[m]itigating circumstances\u201d as\n\n\n       10\n          Mr. Underwood does not contend\u2014nor do we conclude\u2014that the alleged\nprosecutorial misconduct infringed any specific constitutional right. He must therefore\nsatisfy the Donnelly fundamental unfairness standard to show reversible constitutional\nerror warranting habeas relief. See Littlejohn, 704 F.3d at 837.\n\n                                              21\n\f\u201cthose which, in fairness, sympathy, and mercy, may extenuate or reduce the degree of\n\nmoral culpability or blame.\u201d O.R. at 1491.11 The OCCA rejected this claim on the\n\nmerits. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 244.\n\n       In addressing this claim, we begin with the relevant legal background and\n\nadditional factual and procedural background. We then examine the OCCA\u2019s merits\n\ndecision under \u00a7 2254(d) and conclude that it was not contrary to\u2014or an unreasonable\n\napplication of\u2014Supreme Court law or based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\nclaim about Instruction No. 12 and the related prosecutorial arguments.\n\n       a. Legal background\n\n       We first provide general background on the Constitution\u2019s requirements regarding\n\nthe jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings. We\n\nthen discuss Grant v. Royal (Donald Grant), 886 F.3d 874 (10th Cir. 2018), in which this\n\ncourt recently considered and rejected a similar claim for habeas relief.\n\n                i. Overview\n\n       \u201c[T]he Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all\n\nbut the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating\n\nfactor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the\n\noffense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d Lockett v.\n\nOhio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion) (footnote omitted); accord Eddings v.\n\n\n       11\n            \u201cO.R.\u201d refers to the record filed in Mr. Underwood\u2019s direct appeal to the OCCA.\n\n\n                                              22\n\fOklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110 (1982). \u201c[E]vidence, even if not related specifically to\n\npetitioner\u2019s culpability for the crime he committed . . . must be treated as relevant\n\nmitigating evidence if it serves as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d Johnson v.\n\nTexas, 509 U.S. 350, 381 (1993) (alterations, citations, and quotations omitted).\n\n       \u201cThe standard against which we assess whether jury instructions satisfy the rule of\n\nLockett and Eddings was set forth in Boyde v. California, [494 U.S. 370 (1990)].\u201d\n\nJohnson, 509 U.S. at 367. \u201c[T]he proper inquiry . . . is whether there is a reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the\n\nconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380. The\n\nreasonable likelihood test also governs claims that \u201carguments by the prosecutor . . .\n\nreinforced an impermissible interpretation of [the challenged jury instruction] and made it\n\nlikely that jurors would arrive at such an understanding.\u201d Id. at 834.\n\n              ii. Grant v. Royal\n\n       In Grant, this court denied a habeas petitioner\u2019s Lockett/Eddings claim based on\n\npunishment stage jury instructions and prosecutorial arguments analogous to those at\n\nissue in this case. The petitioner \u201cargue[d] that one of the sentencing-phase jury\n\ninstructions, Instruction 12, standing alone and in conjunction with the State\u2019s closing\n\nargument, unconstitutionally limited the jury\u2019s consideration of evidence presented in\n\nmitigation of his death sentence.\u201d (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d at 930-31. The challenged\n\ninstruction read: \u201cMitigating circumstances are those which, in fairness, sympathy, and\n\nmercy, may extenuate or reduce the degree of moral culpability or blame.\u201d Id. at 931\n\n(quotations omitted). During rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor specifically\n\n\n                                              23\n\femployed this language, telling the jury that \u201cwhat the law says is that before something\n\ncan be mitigating it must reduce the moral culpability or blame of the defendant.\u201d Id. at\n\n937 (alterations omitted). And, in discussing the petitioner\u2019s mitigating evidence relating\n\nto his alleged schizophrenia, the prosecutor argued that it \u201cdoes not in any way\u201d reduce\n\nthe petitioner\u2019s \u201cmoral culpability or blame.\u201d Id.\n\n       Applying AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, we held that the OCCA neither\n\ncontradicted nor unreasonably applied Lockett/Eddings and its progeny in rejecting the\n\npetitioner\u2019s challenge to Instruction 12 and the prosecution\u2019s statements relating to the\n\ninstruction. Id. at 936. We reasoned that, \u201ceven if . . . the [prosecutorial] arguments . . .\n\nwere improper, that would not necessarily mean that the OCCA was unreasonable in\n\ndetermining that there was no Lockett error because there was no reasonable likelihood\n\nthat the jury was precluded . . . from considering . . . mitigating evidence . . . that did not\n\nextenuate or reduce [the petitioner\u2019s] moral culpability or blame.\u201d Id. at 938 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n       In reaching this result, we examined the record and found reasonable support for\n\nthe OCCA\u2019s determination. First, in addition to the challenged \u201cmoral culpability or\n\nblame\u201d language, Instruction 12 also included \u201clanguage that vested the jury with the\n\nresponsibility for determining what evidence was mitigating: \u2018The determination of what\n\ncircumstances are mitigating is for you to resolve under the facts and circumstances of\n\nthis case.\u2019\u201d Id. at 940 (quoting Instruction 12). Second, a separate instruction\u2014\n\nInstruction 13\u2014\u201cinformed the jury that \u2018evidence had been introduced as to specified . . .\n\nmitigating circumstances\u2019 and then listed . . . factors that ordinarily would not be deemed\n\n\n                                                24\n\fto have extenuated or reduced [the petitioner]\u2019s moral culpability or blame.\u201d Id.\n\n(alterations omitted) (emphasis in original) (quoting Instruction 13). Instruction 13 also\n\n\u201cended with this admonition: \u2018In addition, you may decide that other mitigating\n\ncircumstances exist, and if so, you should consider those circumstances as well.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n(emphasis in original) (quoting Instruction 13). Third, a separate instruction\u2014Instruction\n\n17\u2014\u201cspecifically admonished the jury that [the court\u2019s] instructions \u2018contain all the law\n\nand rules you must follow.\u2019\u201d Id. at 941 (quoting Instruction 17). Fourth, in unchallenged\n\nportions of the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor \u201cspent the lion\u2019s share of her time\n\ncasting doubt on the veracity, credibility, and weight of the evidence supporting the\n\nmitigating circumstances that the court identified in Instruction 13.\u201d Id. at 942. Fifth,\n\n\u201c[a]t no point during her opening closing remarks did [the prosecutor] assert that the jury\n\nwas not free under the law to consider all of the mitigating factors that the court identified\n\nin Instruction 13 on the ground that some of them did not extenuate or reduce moral\n\nculpability or blame.\u201d Id. at 943.\n\n       b. Relevant facts\n\n       This section presents the relevant jury instructions and prosecutorial arguments on\n\nthe mitigating evidence given in the punishment stage of Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial.\n\n              i. Jury instructions\n\n       Three of the punishment stage jury instructions\u201412, 13, and 20\u2014are relevant.\n\n       Instruction 12\u2014the challenged instruction\u2014contained identical language to\n\nInstruction 12 in Grant: \u201cMitigating circumstances are those which, in fairness,\n\nsympathy, and mercy, may extenuate or reduce the degree of moral culpability or blame.\n\n\n                                              25\n\fThe determination of what circumstances are mitigating is for you to resolve under the\n\nfacts and circumstances of this case.\u201d O.R. at 1491 (emphasis added).\n\n      Instruction 13 also contained identical language to Instruction 13 in Grant:\n\n\u201cEvidence has been introduced as to the following mitigating circumstances: [a list of 15\n\ncircumstances]. In addition, you may decide that other mitigating circumstances exist,\n\nand if so, you should consider those circumstances as well.\u201d O.R. at 1492-93.12 As in\n\n\n      12\n           Instruction 13 listed fifteen separate circumstances:\n\n               1. Kevin Ray Underwood was exposed to severe trauma and\n                  mistreatment by his peers while growing up, and got\n                  through life only with the aid of a close circle of\n                  \u201cprotectors\u201d.\n               2. Kevin Ray Underwood has, except for his crime against\n                  [J.B.], no prior history of any violent act.\n               3. Kevin Ray Underwood has, except for his crime against\n                  [J.B.] and a single speeding ticket, no prior history of\n                  violating any law.\n               4. Kevin Ray Underwood suffers from several psychological\n                  and psychiatric disorders including, but not limited to:\n                  schizotypal personality disorder, bi-polar disorder type II,\n                  multiple paraphilias, severe social phobia, anxiety, early\n                  onset of neuro-developmental disorder. None of these\n                  conditions has ever been appropriately treated by a mental\n                  health professional.\n               5. Kevin Ray Underwood was subjected to emotional and\n                  verbal abuse by his parents while growing up.\n               6. Kevin Ray Underwood has family and friends who love\n                  him, find meaning in his life, and will continue to visit\n                  him in prison.\n               7. Kevin Ray Underwood cooperated with law enforcement\n                  by giving a full confession to the murder of [J.B.].\n               8. Kevin Ray Underwood has expressed remorse for the\n                  killing of [J.B.]\n               9. Kevin Ray Underwood has spent most of his life on the\n                  fringe of society and constantly subjected to ridicule even\n                  into his adult years.\n\n                                               26\n\fGrant, the circumstances enumerated in Instruction 13 included some that \u201cordinarily\n\nwould not be deemed to have extenuated or reduced [the petitioner]\u2019s moral culpability or\n\nblame.\u201d (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d at 940 (quotations omitted). For instance, Instruction\n\n13 listed circumstances pertaining to Mr. Underwood\u2019s childhood and the value others\n\nplace in his life. Compare O.R. 1492 (\u201cKevin Ray Underwood was exposed to severe\n\ntrauma and mistreatment by his peers while growing up\u201d) with (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d\n\nat 940 (\u201cA substantial portion of Donald Grant\u2019s childhood was spent in a violent and\n\ndrug-infested neighborhood.\u201d (quotations omitted)); compare O.R. 1492 (\u201cKevin Ray\n\nUnderwood has family and friends who love him, find meaning in his life, and will\n\ncontinue to visit him in prison.\u201d) with (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d at 940 (\u201cDonald Grant\u2019s\n\nlife will be of value to other persons besides himself.\u201d (quotations omitted)).\n\n\n              10. Kevin Ray Underwood\u2019s multiple psychological and\n                  psychiatric problems have prevented him from taking full\n                  advantage of his intellect by continuing his education and\n                  gaining employment appropriate to his intelligence level.\n              11. Kevin Ray Underwood will not be around young children\n                  if sentenced to prison for life.\n              12. Kevin Ray Underwood is much more likely to be\n                  victimized in prison than posing a risk of violence to\n                  others. In fact, his chances of harming anyone in prison\n                  are very, very small.\n              13. The symptoms and effects of Kevin Ray Underwood\u2019s\n                  mental illnesses can be adequately controlled and lessened\n                  through appropriate and low-cost medication and\n                  treatment.\n              14. Kevin Ray Underwood comes from a family with a\n                  significant history of mental illness.\n              15. Kevin Ray Underwood has scored very low on scientific\n                  testing instruments designed to predict future violence.\n\nO.R. at 1492-93.\n\n                                              27\n\f       Instruction 20 again contained identical language to Instruction 17 in Grant,\n\ninstructing the jury that court\u2019s instructions together \u201ccontain all the law and rules you\n\nmust follow.\u201d O.R. at 1500.\n\n              ii. Prosecutorial arguments\n\n       As in Grant, the prosecution\u2019s closing argument in the sentencing phase of Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s trial used the \u201cmoral culpability or blame\u201d language from Instruction 12.\n\nIn closing, the prosecution addressed the jury as follows: \u201c[T]he law . . . [t]alks to you\n\nthen about mitigating circumstances. Those are things which, in fairness, sympathy, and\n\nmercy, may extenuate or reduce the degree of moral culpability or blame. Reduce the\n\nmoral culpability or blame. And you have a list of a whole bunch of them.\u201d Trial Tr.\n\nVol. X at 2518 (emphasis added).\n\n       The prosecution then attacked each of the circumstances listed in Instruction 13.\n\nFor many of the circumstances, the prosecution attacked the quality and quantity of Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s evidence. See, e.g., id. at 2518-19 (\u201c[Defense counsel] talk[s] about that\n\n[Mr. Underwood] suffers from the psychological disorders. . . . He faked the test to look\n\nbad. You\u2019ve got to wonder how you can trust or judge what he says when he\u2019s talking to\n\na psychiatrist.\u201d). But for some of the circumstances, the prosecution\u2019s main or only\n\nattack invoked Instruction 12\u2019s \u201cmoral culpability or blame\u201d framework. Regarding Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s alleged exposure to trauma and mistreatment by his peers, the prosecution\n\nstated: \u201c[L]et\u2019s say he was. Does that reduce his blame for the killing of [J.B.]?\u201d Id. at\n\n2518. Regarding Mr. Underwood\u2019s alleged family support, the prosecution stated: \u201cHow\n\ndoes that, the fact that you have family and friends, reduce your blame for a crime?\u201d Id.\n\n\n                                              28\n\fat 2520. Regarding Mr. Underwood\u2019s alleged inability to obtain appropriate employment\n\ndue to various psychiatric disorders, the prosecution stated: \u201cSo? How does that lessen\n\nhis blame or culpability for the crime that he didn\u2019t have a very good job?\u201d Id. at 2523.\n\nAnd regarding Mr. Underwood\u2019s alleged significant family history of mental illness, the\n\nprosecution stated simply: \u201cSo?\u201d Id.\n\n       After remarking on each of the circumstances listed in Instruction 13, the\n\nprosecution concluded by advising the jury to \u201clook at all of those mitigators\u201d and to\n\n\u201cdecide what that means.\u201d Id. at 2525. In its rebuttal closing argument, the prosecution\n\nrepeated many of the same points highlighted above.\n\n       c. OCCA and federal district court decisions\n\n       In his appeal to the OCCA, Mr. Underwood argued that the trial court\u2019s wording\n\nof Instruction 12 and the prosecution\u2019s arguments relating to it constituted reversible\n\nerror. Id. at 244. The OCCA denied Mr. Underwood\u2019s Lockett/Eddings claim on the\n\nmerits. Id. at 244-45. Mr. Underwood then sought federal habeas relief, which the\n\ndistrict court denied. Underwood, 2016 WL 4059162, at *26.\n\n       d. Analysis\n\n       We review the OCCA\u2019s decision under \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (d)(2) and conclude that\n\nit was not contrary to\u2014or an unreasonable application of\u2014clearly established Supreme\n\nCourt law or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\n\n              i. Section 2254(d)(1): Reasonableness of legal determinations\n\n       The OCCA\u2019s conclusion that Instruction 12 and the prosecution\u2019s related\n\narguments did not warrant relief was consistent with and a reasonable application of\n\n\n                                              29\n\fLockett/Eddings and its progeny. As discussed above, Grant so held on facts\n\nindistinguishable from this case in all relevant respects, and Mr. Underwood has offered\n\nno reason why we should reverse this precedent.13 Nor could we, as \u201c[w]e are bound by\n\nthe precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary\n\ndecision by the Supreme Court.\u201d United States v. Meyers, 200 F.3d 715, 720 (10th Cir.\n\n2000) (quotations omitted). We therefore cannot hold that the OCCA contradicted or\n\nunreasonably applied Lockett/Eddings and its progeny in adjudicating Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\nclaim.\n\n               ii. Section 2254(d)(2): Reasonableness of factual determinations\n\n         The OCCA did not base its conclusion\u2014that Instruction 12 and the prosecution\u2019s\n\nrelated arguments do not warrant relief\u2014on an unreasonable factual determination. Mr.\n\nUnderwood argues that the OCCA made \u201can unreasonable determination of facts in that\n\nit misstate[d] the prosecution\u2019s argument.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 52 n.18. But the OCCA\u2019s\n\nopinion nowhere misquoted the prosecution\u2019s argument. Rather, the OCCA \u201cfound no\n\nerror\u201d after \u201c[c]onsidering the [prosecutorial] arguments as a whole.\u201d Underwood, 252\n\nP.3d at 244. The \u201carguments as a whole\u201d included \u201cthe prosecutor[\u2019s] t[elling] the jurors\n\nthat they were to decide what qualified as mitigating evidence, and that they could\n\n         13\n          Grant in turn relied on this court\u2019s previous decision in Hanson v. Sherrod, 797\nF.3d 810 (10th Cir. 2015), which also denied habeas relief on a Lockett/Eddings claim\ninvolving similar jury instructions and prosecutorial arguments. We stated that \u201c[t]hough\nthe factual circumstances of Hanson are not entirely on all fours with [Grant], its mode of\nanalysis is instructive and its substantive holding provides cogent support for the\nconclusion we reach [in Grant].\u201d (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d at 939. This statement\napplies equally here, where the factual circumstances are effectively on all fours with\nGrant. But we need not discuss Hanson\u2019s reasoning because Grant directly controls this\ncase\u2019s resolution.\n\n                                             30\n\fconsider factors besides those advanced by the defense.\u201d Id. This court has previously\n\ncharacterized such statements as \u201c\u2018encourag[ing] the jury to consider all sorts of\n\nmitigating evidence,\u2019 including the kind that did not extenuate or reduce moral\n\nculpability or blame.\u201d (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d at 942 (quoting Hanson v. Sherrod, 797\n\nF.3d 810, 852 (10th Cir. 2015)).\n\n4. Unconstitutional Victim Impact Evidence\n\n       Mr. Underwood contends that he is entitled to relief from his death sentence based\n\non the trial court\u2019s admission of unconstitutional victim impact evidence. The OCCA\n\nfound no error. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 248. In light of Bosse v. Oklahoma, 137 S. Ct. 1\n\n(2016) (per curiam), however, the State concedes that the admission of the challenged\n\nevidence here\u2014J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentence recommendations\u2014violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment. The parties dispute whether this error warrants automatic relief, and, if not,\n\nwhether this error prejudiced Mr. Underwood\u2019s defense.\n\n       In addressing this claim, we begin with general legal background on the\n\nConstitution\u2019s limitations on the admission of victim impact evidence in capital cases, as\n\nwell as additional factual and procedural background relevant to Mr. Underwood\u2019s claim.\n\nWe then consider the issues disputed by the parties, providing additional background as\n\nneeded. Because the OCCA found no error and thus had no occasion to address these\n\nissues, we consider them de novo. See Cole, 755 F.3d at 1148 (\u201cIf a claim was not\n\nresolved by the state courts on the merits[,] . . . \u00a7 2254(d) . . . do[es] not apply . . . , [and]\n\nwe review the [federal] district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings,\n\nif any, for clear error.\u201d); Lockett, 711 F.3d at 1218 (\u201cBecause the OCCA erred in finding\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fno Eighth Amendment violation, we grant no deference to its harmless error analysis and\n\nconsider the question de novo.\u201d). We conclude that the error here neither warrants\n\nautomatic relief nor prejudiced the defense under the applicable standard. We therefore\n\naffirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Mr. Underwood\u2019s claim based on the\n\nadmission of J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentence recommendations.\n\n       a. Legal background\n\n       In Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987), the Supreme Court \u201cheld that \u2018the\n\nEighth Amendment prohibits a capital sentencing jury from considering victim impact\n\nevidence\u2019 that does not \u2018relate directly to the circumstances of the crime.\u2019\u201d Bosse, 137 S.\n\nCt. at 1 (quoting Booth, 482 U.S. at 501-02, 507, n.10 (1987)). In Payne v. Tennessee,\n\n501 U.S. 808 (1991), the Court overruled Booth in part and held that the Eighth\n\nAmendment allows consideration of \u201c\u2018victim impact\u2019 evidence relating to the personal\n\ncharacteristics of the victim and the emotional impact of the crimes on the victim\u2019s\n\nfamily.\u201d Id. at 817, 827; see Bosse, 137 S. Ct. at 1-2.\n\n       The OCCA has long interpreted Payne as \u201cimplicitly overrul[ing] that portion of\n\nBooth regarding characterizations of the defendant and opinions of the sentence.\u201d E.g.,\n\nConover v. State, 933 P.2d 904, 920 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997), abrogated by Bosse, 137\n\nS. Ct. 904. This court has long disagreed with the OCCA. Starting with United States v.\n\nMcVeigh, we have interpreted Booth and Payne to prohibit the prosecution from\n\npresenting sentencing recommendations from family members of the victim. 153 F.3d\n\n1166, 1217 (10th Cir. 1998) (\u201cPayne did not overrule the prohibitions in Booth against\n\nthe admission of [victim\u2019s family members\u2019 sentence recommendations]\u201d); see also Hain\n\n\n                                              32\n\fv. Gibson, 287 F.3d 1224, 1238-39 (10th Cir. 2002) (\u201cTo date, three circuits, including\n\nour own, have expressly recognized that the portion of Booth prohibiting family members\n\nof a victim from stating \u2018characterizations and opinions about . . . the appropriate\n\nsentence\u2019 during the penalty phase of a capital trial survived the holding in Payne and\n\nremains valid.\u201d).\n\n       The Supreme Court recently clarified that the OCCA \u201cremains bound by Booth\u2019s\n\nprohibition on characterizations and opinions from a victim\u2019s family members about the\n\ncrime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence unless this Court reconsiders that ban\u201d\n\nand that the OCCA \u201cerred in concluding otherwise.\u201d Bosse, 137 S. Ct. at 2.\n\n       b. Relevant facts\u2014the sentence recommendations\n\n       In the punishment stage of Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial, the trial court admitted victim\n\nimpact testimony from J.B.\u2019s mother and father that included their opinions about the\n\nappropriate sentence.14 After J.B.\u2019s mother testified to the impact of J.B.\u2019s loss, the\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n       Q: [L]et me ask you, do you have a recommendation as to the appropriate\n           punishment for this defendant?\n       A: Yeah.\n       Q: And what is that?\n       A: He\u2014The death penalty. I don\u2019t have my little girl.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           When the State noticed its intention to present these sentence recommendations,\nthe trial court warned that \u201cthe Tenth Circuit is not real favorable to this kind of\ntestimony but that it has been allowed in Oklahoma, but it is one of those things that\ncould be a risk of reversal.\u201d Trial Tr. Vol. VIII at 1882. But the court agreed to admit\nthe recommendations \u201c[a]s long as [J.B.\u2019s parents] kn[ew] that and they\u2019ve made that\nchoice,\u201d as was the case. Id.\n\n                                              33\n\fTrial Tr. Vol. VIII at 1949-50 (emphasis added). After J.B.\u2019s father testified to the\n\nimpact of J.B.\u2019s loss, a similar exchange occurred:\n\n       Q: Do you have a recommendation for this jury as to what you believe is\n          appropriate punishment for the murder of your daughter?\n       A: Yes.\n       Q: Can you tell me what that is?\n       A: Would be the death penalty.\n\nId. at 1953-54 (emphasis added).\n\n       After the presentation of punishment stage evidence, the trial court instructed the\n\njury on the role of victim impact evidence: \u201cThis evidence is simply another method of\n\ninforming you about the specific harm caused by the crime in question. You may\n\nconsider this evidence in determining an appropriate punishment. However, your\n\nconsideration must be limited to a moral inquiry into the culpability of the defendant, not\n\nan emotional response to the evidence.\u201d O.R. at 1499 (emphasis added).\n\n       At no point in its closing argument did the prosecution expressly refer to J.B.\u2019s\n\nparents\u2019 sentence recommendations. It merely summarized other portions of their victim\n\nimpact statements, emphasizing that J.B.\u2019s death \u201cis a loss that her family will never\n\nrecover from.\u201d Trial Tr. Vol. X at 2527. It also advised the jury that the impact\n\nstatements spoke to \u201cthe specific harm that [J.B.\u2019s] murder caused\u201d and could be\n\nconsidered in determining the appropriate punishment. Id. at 2526. In rebuttal, the\n\nprosecution \u201csubmit[ted] to [the jury]\u201d that \u201canything less\u201d than death would be \u201can\n\ninjustice for [J.B.]\u201d and \u201can injustice for that family sitting right there.\u201d Id. at 2565.\n\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\f       c. OCCA and federal district court decisions\n\n       In his appeal to the OCCA, Mr. Underwood argued that the trial court\u2019s admission\n\nof J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentence recommendations constituted reversible error. Underwood,\n\n252 P.3d at 248. The OCCA denied Mr. Underwood\u2019s Booth claim on the merits, finding\n\nno error. Id. Mr. Underwood then sought federal habeas relief, which the district court\n\ndenied because it determined that the error was harmless under the standard set forth in\n\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993). Underwood, 2016 WL 4059162, at *18-\n\n*19.\n\n       d. Structural error, Footnote Nine error, or trial error\n\n       Mr. Underwood contends that he is entitled to automatic relief from his death\n\nsentence based on the concededly unconstitutional admission of J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentence\n\nrecommendations at his trial. The State disagrees, arguing that Mr. Underwood is\n\nentitled to relief only if the Booth error was not harmless under Brecht. Mr. Underwood\n\nsubmits that the Booth error warrants automatic relief because (1) it was structural error,\n\nand (2) it falls under the class of errors that infect a proceeding\u2019s integrity, as described in\n\nfootnote nine of Brecht (\u201cFootnote Nine\u201d).\n\n       In addressing Mr. Underwood\u2019s arguments, we first provide additional legal\n\nbackground. We then consider Mr. Underwood\u2019s arguments and conclude that he is not\n\nentitled to automatic relief based on the conceded Booth error here.\n\n              i. Additional legal background\n\n       On habeas review, we ordinarily apply the Brecht standard to determine whether\n\nconstitutional error warrants relief from the challenged conviction or sentence. Under\n\n\n                                               35\n\fthis standard, constitutional error may be disregarded unless found to have \u201chad\n\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Brecht,\n\n507 U.S. at 638. \u201cIf a reviewing court is in \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to the harmlessness of an\n\nerror, the habeas petitioner must win.\u201d Crease v. McKune, 189 F.3d 1188, 1193 (10th\n\nCir. 1999) (quoting O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 436 (1995)). \u201cIn harmless error\n\nanalysis in a capital case, we are mindful of the need for heightened reliability in\n\ndetermining a capital sentence.\u201d Mollett v. Mullin, 348 F.3d 902, 920 (10th Cir. 2003)\n\n(quotations omitted); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 422 (1995) (\u201c[O]ur duty to\n\nsearch for constitutional error with painstaking care is never more exacting than it is in a\n\ncapital case.\u201d (quotations omitted)).\n\n       We provide additional background on two circumstances where constitutional\n\nerror alone requires reversal and the harmless error doctrine therefore does not apply: (1)\n\nstructural error, and (2) Footnote Nine error.\n\n                      1) Structural error\n\n       Notwithstanding Brecht, constitutional errors that rise to the level of \u201cstructural\n\nerror\u201d\u2014in contrast to ordinary \u201ctrial error\u201d\u2014require automatic reversal. As the Supreme\n\nCourt explained in Arizona v. Fulminante, \u201c\u2018trial error\u2019 . . . occur[s] during the\n\npresentation of the case to the jury, and . . . may therefore be . . . assessed . . . to\n\ndetermine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d whereas\n\n\u201cstructural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism . . . defy analysis by\n\n\u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards.\u201d 499 U.S. 279, 307-08 (1991).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f       \u201cA defining feature of structural error is that the resulting unfairness or prejudice\n\nis necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, such that any inquiry into its effect on the\n\noutcome of the case would be purely speculative.\u201d United States v. Solon, 596 F.3d\n\n1206, 1211 (10th Cir. 2010) (quotations omitted); see also United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nLopez, 548 U.S. 140, 149 n.4 (2006) (\u201c[A]s we have done in the past, we rest our\n\nconclusion of structural error upon the difficulty of assessing the effect of the error.\u201d). In\n\ncontrast, the effect of ordinary trial errors \u201cmay \u2018be quantitatively assessed in the context\n\nof other evidence presented.\u2019\u201d Gonzales-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 148 (quoting Fulminante,\n\n499 U.S. at 307-08).\n\n       The Supreme Court has recognized the following categories of structural error: \u201ca\n\ntotal deprivation of the right to counsel; the lack of an impartial trial judge; the unlawful\n\nexclusion of grand jurors of defendant\u2019s race; a deprivation of the right to self-\n\nrepresentation at trial; the denial of the right to a public trial; and an erroneous\n\nreasonable-doubt jury instruction.\u201d Solon, 596 F.3d at 1211.\n\n                       2) Footnote Nine error\n\n       Apart from structural error, the Supreme Court in Brecht suggested another\n\npotential type of error warranting automatic relief. In Footnote Nine, the Court stated\n\nthat Brecht \u201cdoes not foreclose the possibility that in an unusual case, a deliberate and\n\nespecially egregious error of the trial type, or one that is combined with a pattern of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, might so infect the integrity of the proceeding as to warrant the\n\ngrant of habeas relief, even if it did not substantially influence the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d 507\n\nU.S. at 638 n.9.\n\n\n                                                37\n\f       This court has not previously had occasion to apply Footnote Nine to a Booth error\n\ninvolving the admission of unconstitutional sentence recommendations in a capital case.\n\nBut we find Duckett v. Mullin, 306 F.3d 982 (10th Cir. 2002), in which we applied\n\nFootnote Nine to alleged prosecutorial misconduct, instructive.\n\n       In Duckett, the habeas petitioner argued for application of Brecht\u2019s Footnote Nine\n\nexception to the harmless error doctrine based on the Oklahoma prosecutor\u2019s improper\n\nremarks in both the guilt and sentencing stages of the trial. Id. at 993. The prosecutor in\n\nDuckett had made improper remarks such as, in arguing for the death sentence, asking the\n\njury whether it would serve \u201cjustice [to] send this man down to prison, let him have clean\n\nsheets to sleep on every night, three good meals a day, visits by his friends and family,\n\nwhile [the victim] lies cold in his grave?\u201d Id. at 992.\n\n       This particular prosecutor \u201cha[d] been chastised for participating in the same type\n\nof improper argumentation in other cases.\u201d Id. at 993. Both the OCCA and federal\n\ncourts had \u201crepeatedly condemned [him] and prosecutors from his office for their\n\nhabitual misconduct in argument.\u201d Id. at 993 n.4 (quotations omitted). Accordingly,\n\n\u201cour past experiences with this prosecutor le[ft] us convinced that his inappropriate\n\ncommentary at trial was intentional and calculated.\u201d Id. at 993 (quotations omitted). We\n\nfurther observed that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpersistent misconduct . . . has without doubt\n\nharmed the reputation of Oklahoma\u2019s criminal justice system and left the unenviable\n\nlegacy of an indelibly tarnished legal career.\u201d Id. at 994. And we emphasized that \u201c[o]ur\n\nnation\u2019s confidence in the fair and just administration of the death penalty is disserved by\n\nprosecutors who cynically test the bounds of the harmless-error doctrine.\u201d Id.\n\n\n                                              38\n\f        Even so, we determined that the challenged prosecutorial misconduct did not rise\n\nto the level of Footnote Nine error, noting that \u201c[t]he due process concerns flagged by\n\nfootnote nine of Brecht will manifest themselves only in very limited circumstances.\u201d Id.\n\nat 994-95. Specifically, we stated that the key inquiry governing \u201cwhether the footnote\u2019s\n\nexemption will be applicable \u2018is whether the integrity of the proceeding was so infected\n\nthat the entire trial was unfair[,]\u2019\u201d and we could not conclude that that was so on\n\nDuckett\u2019s facts. Id. at 995 (quoting Hardnett v. Marshall, 25 F.3d 875, 879 (9th Cir.\n\n1994)); see also Torres v. Mullin, 317 F.3d 1145, 1159 (10th Cir. 2003) (declining to\n\napply Footnote Nine in a post-Duckett case involving the same Oklahoma prosecutor).\n\n              ii. Analysis\n\n        Mr. Underwood is not entitled to automatic relief because the Booth error here\n\nconstituted neither structural error nor Footnote Nine error. We address each argument in\n\nturn.\n\n                     1) Structural error\n\n        The admission of J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentence recommendations does not amount to\n\nstructural error. The error\u2019s effect may be evaluated in light of the other evidence at trial\n\nand thus is not \u201cnecessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate.\u201d Solon, 596 F.3d at 1211.\n\n        Mr. Underwood contends that \u201cjudges from this Court have indicated, rightly so,\n\nthat sentencing recommendations by victim\u2019s family members can rise to the level of\n\nstructural error, requiring automatic reversal.\u201d Aplt. Suppl. Br. at 5-6 (citing Hain, 287\n\nF.3d at 1239 n.11; DeRosa v. Workman, 696 F.3d 1302, 1305 (10th Cir. 2012) (Mem.)\n\n(Lucero, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)). We disagree. In Hain, we\n\n\n                                              39\n\fremarked that \u201c[t]he decision in Booth does not expressly indicate whether the [Supreme]\n\nCourt believed [victim impact] errors to be trial errors subject to harmless error review,\n\nor structural error requiring automatic reversal.\u201d 287 F.3d at 1239 n.11. We\n\n\u201c[n]evertheless . . . d[id] not believe the OCCA unreasonably applied Booth in\n\nconcluding that such errors are subject to harmless error review.\u201d Id.\n\n       Since Hain, we have repeatedly applied Brecht\u2019s harmless error analysis to Booth\n\nerrors on de novo review, thus necessarily concluding that such errors are indeed subject\n\nto harmless error review. See, e.g., Grant v. Trammell (John Grant), 727 F.3d 1006,\n\n1016-17 (10th Cir. 2013). Contrary to Mr. Underwood\u2019s assertion, Judge Lucero did not\n\ndisagree with this legal conclusion in his dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in\n\nDeRosa. See DeRosa, 696 F.3d at 1305 (\u201cWere the option not foreclosed by precedent,\n\none could make a strong case that the [OCCA\u2019s] pattern of ignoring the United States\n\nSupreme Court should be immune from harmless error review as akin to structural error.\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n                     2) Footnote Nine error\n\n       The admission of J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentence recommendations does not amount to\n\nFootnote Nine error. As discussed above, \u201c[t]he due process concerns flagged by\n\nfootnote nine of Brecht will manifest themselves only in very limited circumstances.\u201d\n\nDuckett, 306 F.3d at 994-95. Mr. Underwood contends that we are faced with such a\n\ncircumstance here. He asserts that the \u201cOCCA, state trial judges, and prosecutors have\n\nrepeatedly and deliberately violated capital defendants\u2019 Eighth Amendment rights\n\nthrough the admission of victim[s\u2019] family members\u2019 sentencing recommendations.\u201d\n\n\n                                              40\n\fAplt. Suppl. Br. at 6. He further asserts that \u201cthis pattern has impugned the very integrity\n\nof the fair trial process.\u201d Id. at 6-7.\n\n       We agree that the OCCA has disregarded longstanding Supreme Court precedent\n\nand has refused to recognize Booth errors. But even in Duckett, where we acknowledged\n\nthat the prosecutor\u2019s flagrant and persistent misconduct was \u201cemphatically not condoned\n\nby this court . . . [and] has without doubt harmed the reputation of Oklahoma\u2019s criminal\n\njustice system,\u201d we nevertheless said that the application of Footnote Nine requires\n\nmore\u2014it requires that the error \u201cin the present case so infected the trial as to make the\n\nproceeding fundamentally unfair and thus immune from harmless-error review.\u201d 306\n\nF.3d at 994, 995 (emphasis added). Duckett therefore compels us to conclude that the\n\ntrial in the present case was not rendered fundamentally unfair by the Booth error,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact, as Mr. Underwood puts it, \u201cthat Oklahoma courts and\n\nprosecutors have continued to pursue the very victim-impact evidence precluded by\n\nBooth\u2014for nearly 30 years.\u201d Aplt. Suppl. Br. at 6-7.\n\n       e. Brecht harmless error analysis\n\n       Mr. Underwood contends that he is entitled to relief from his death sentence\n\nbecause he can show \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d under the Brecht standard. We\n\nfirst provide additional background on this court\u2019s application of Brecht to the admission\n\nof unconstitutional sentence recommendations. We then summarize the mitigating and\n\naggravating evidence presented at Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial to provide context for our\n\nanalysis. Guided by our precedents, we evaluate the conceded Booth error\u2019s prejudicial\n\nimpact in light of this context and conclude that it does not warrant habeas relief.\n\n\n                                              41\n\f              i. Additional legal background\n\n       This court has held that the admission of unconstitutional victim sentence\n\nrecommendations required reversal under the Brecht standard in only one case: Dodd v.\n\nTrammell, 753 F.3d 971 (10th Cir. 2013). Before Dodd, \u201cno prior panel of this court\n\nha[d] ruled that victim recommendations of the death penalty required reversal.\u201d Id. at\n\n997. The Dodd panel acknowledged ten previous decisions holding \u201cthat such testimony\n\nwas harmless.\u201d Id.15 It cited three factors warranting a different result in that case: (1)\n\n\u201cthe sheer volume of [the unconstitutional] testimony,\u201d which included a \u201cdrumbeat\u201d of\n\nseven death recommendations; (2) that the jury did not find the HAC aggravator or the\n\ncontinuing threat aggravator;16 and (3) that the defendant\u2019s guilt \u201cwas not as clear cut\u201d as\n\nin previous decisions, due to the prosecution\u2019s sole reliance on circumstantial evidence.\n\nId. at 997-98. Based on these factors, the panel found itself \u201cin grave doubt about the\n\neffect of the error on the jury\u2019s sentencing decision\u201d and held that \u201cthe admission of the\n\n       15\n         The panel cited (John) Grant, 727 F.3d at 1015\u201317; Lockett, 711 F.3d at 1226,\n1238\u201340; Lott v. Trammell, 705 F.3d 1167, 1202, 1214, 1218\u201319 (10th Cir. 2013);\nDeRosa v. Workman, 679 F.3d 1196, 1236\u201337, 1240 (10th Cir. 2012), reh\u2019g denied in\nDeRosa, 696 F.3d 1302; Selsor v.

Dodd, 753 F.3d 971 at\n997.\n       16\n         The Dodd panel noted that in seven of the ten decisions it reviewed, the jury\nfound the HAC aggravator and that, in two of the remaining three decisions, the jury\nfound the continuing threat aggravator. 753 F.3d at 998. And \u201c[i]n the only case in\nwhich the jury did not find either [of these] aggravator[s], the two victim statements \u2018did\nnot expressly refer to the defendant being put to death; instead, they both simply stated\nwithout embellishment that they agreed with the prosecution\u2019s \u201crecommended\nsentence.\u201d\u2019\u201d Id. (alterations omitted) (quoting Selsor, 644 F.3d at 1027).\n\n                                              42\n\fsentence recommendations in this case was not harmless.\u201d Id. at 999 (citations and\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n              ii. Additional relevant facts\n\n       To determine whether J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 statements had a substantial and injurious\n\neffect on the jury\u2019s sentencing decision, we must consider them in the overall context of\n\nthe trial and the \u201crecord as a whole.\u201d Brecht, 507 U.S. at 638; see also Lockett, 711 F.3d\n\nat 1239 (\u201cIn evaluating whether the unconstitutional portions of the [victim impact]\n\nstatement had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury, we must consider it in the\n\ncontext of all of the aggravating and mitigating evidence.\u201d). We therefore summarize the\n\naggravating and mitigating evidence presented during the sentencing phase of Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s trial.\n\n                       1) The aggravating case\n\n       The State\u2019s aggravating case consisted primarily of the guilt stage evidence, which\n\nit incorporated into the punishment stage. The guilt stage evidence included, most\n\nnotably, the video recording and transcript of Mr. Underwood\u2019s interview with the FBI,\n\nduring which, as the OCCA wrote, he \u201cdescribe[d] how he had recently developed a\n\ndesire to abduct a person, sexually molest them, eat their flesh, and dispose of their\n\nremains\u201d and \u201cexplain[ed] in considerable detail how he attempted to carry out this plan\n\non [J.B.], whom he had decided was a convenient victim.\u201d Underwood, 252 P.3d at 231.\n\nThese details included that he had (1) \u201chit [J.B.] on the back of the head several times\n\nwith a wooden cutting board\u201d and heard her \u201cscream[ing] in pain and beg[ing] him to\n\nstop,\u201d (2) \u201csuffocate[d] [J.B.] by sitting on her and placing his hand across her face . . .\n\n\n                                               43\n\f[for] fifteen to twenty minutes,\u201d (3) \u201cattempted to have sexual relations with [J.B.]\u2019s\n\nbody,\u201d and (4) \u201cattempted to decapitate [J.B.\u2019s body] with a knife.\u201d Id. The guilt stage\n\nevidence also included crime scene photographs taken at Mr. Underwood\u2019s apartment,\n\nphotographs of J.B.\u2019s body taken at the Medical Examiner\u2019s office, and physical items\n\ntaken from Mr. Underwood\u2019s apartment that corroborated his confession.17\n\n                     2) The mitigating case\n\n       Mr. Underwood\u2019s mitigating case consisted of testimony from 19 witnesses over\n\nthree days. They included family members, friends, former teachers, supervisors, and\n\ncoworkers who had known Mr. Underwood at various points in his life, a physician who\n\nhad treated Mr. Underwood for depression, jail officials who had had contact with Mr.\n\nUnderwood since his arrest, and three experts who had evaluated Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\npsychological and psychiatric health and his likelihood of committing future violence.18\n\n       After hearing this testimony, the jury was instructed that \u201c[e]vidence ha[d] been\n\nintroduced as to the following mitigating circumstances:\u201d\n\n              1. Kevin Ray Underwood was exposed to severe trauma and\n                 mistreatment by his peers while growing up, and got\n                 through life only with the aid of a close circle of\n                 \u201cprotectors\u201d.\n\n              2. Kevin Ray Underwood has, except for his crime against\n                 [J.B.], no prior history of any violent act.\n\n\n\n       17\n       For example, the State entered into evidence the cutting board that Mr.\nUnderwood described using to hit J.B. in his confession. State\u2019s Trial Exhibit 171.\n       18\n         The State called its own expert to rebut the defense experts\u2019 testimony. Trial Tr.\nVol. X at 2427-88.\n\n                                              44\n\f3. Kevin Ray Underwood has, except for his crime against\n   [J.B.] and a single speeding ticket, no prior history of\n   violating any law.\n\n4. Kevin Ray Underwood suffers from several psychological\n   and psychiatric disorders including, but not limited to:\n   schizotypal personality disorder, bi-polar disorder type II,\n   multiple paraphilias, severe social phobia, anxiety, early\n   onset of neuro-developmental disorder. None of these\n   conditions has ever been appropriately treated by a mental\n   health professional.\n\n5. Kevin Ray Underwood was subjected to emotional and\n   verbal abuse by his parents while growing up.\n\n6. Kevin Ray Underwood has family and friends who love\n   him, find meaning in his life, and will continue to visit\n   him in prison.\n\n7. Kevin Ray Underwood cooperated with law enforcement\n   by giving a full confession to the murder of [J.B.].\n\n8. Kevin Ray Underwood has expressed remorse for the\n   killing of [J.B.].\n\n9. Kevin Ray Underwood has spent most of his life on the\n   fringe of society and constantly subjected to ridicule even\n   into his adult years.\n\n10. Kevin Ray Underwood\u2019s multiple psychological and\n    psychiatric problems have prevented him from taking full\n    advantage of his intellect by continuing his education and\n    gaining employment appropriate to his intelligence level.\n\n11. Kevin Ray Underwood will not be around young children\n    if sentenced to prison for life.\n\n12. Kevin Ray Underwood is much more likely to be\n    victimized in prison than posing a risk of violence to\n    others. In fact, his chances of harming anyone in prison\n    are very, very small.\n\n\n\n\n                               45\n\f              13. The symptoms and effects of Kevin Ray Underwood\u2019s\n                  mental illnesses can be adequately controlled and lessened\n                  through appropriate and low-cost medication and\n                  treatment.\n\n              14. Kevin Ray Underwood comes from a family with a\n                  significant history of mental illness.\n\n              15. Kevin Ray Underwood has scored very low on scientific\n                  testing instruments designed to predict future violence.\n\nO.R. at 1492-93.\n\n              iii. Analysis\n\n       Based on our careful review of the entire record, we conclude, guided by our\n\nprecedents, that the admission of J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentencing recommendations did not\n\nhave a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d\n\nBrecht, 507 U.S. at 638. Three considerations taken together lead us to this conclusion:\n\n(1) the offending statements were relatively brief and emotionally restrained; (2) the\n\naggravating case was relatively strong; and (3) the mitigating case, while not\n\ninsubstantial, was not sufficient to overcome the aggravating evidence. In discussing\n\nthese considerations below, we also note that none of the factors that warranted reversal\n\nin Dodd are present in this case.\n\n                     1) The sentence recommendations\n\n       The offending statements, J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 sentence recommendations, were\n\n\u201crelatively pallid in comparison to other victim impact statements this circuit has found\n\nharmless.\u201d Lockett, 711 F.3d at 1239. In response to the prosecution\u2019s question eliciting\n\ntheir sentence recommendation, J.B.\u2019s mother stated \u201cThe death penalty. I don\u2019t have my\n\n\n\n                                              46\n\flittle girl.\u201d and J.B.\u2019s father stated \u201cWould be the death penalty.\u201d Trial Tr. Vol. VIII at\n\n1950, 1954. \u201cThis court has held far more extensive pleas to lack the required\n\n\u2018substantial and injurious\u2019 effect on a jury\u2019s verdict when the evidence against the\n\ndefendant at sentencing was strong.\u201d (John) Grant, 727 F.3d at 1017; see also Lockett,\n\n711 F.3d at 1239 (\u201cThe [victim\u2019s parents]\u2019 request for the death penalty was a single,\n\nconcise sentence. In contrast, the three victim statements that were held to be harmless in\n\n[Welch v. Workman, 639 F.3d 980, 990, 999 (10th Cir. 2011)] contained extremely\n\nemotional pleas for the death penalty.\u201d).\n\n       \u201cFurther, the jury was properly instructed by the trial court on the . . . proper role\n\nof victim-impact evidence.\u201d DeRosa v. Workman, 679 F.3d 1196, 1237 (10th Cir. 2012),\n\nreh\u2019g denied in DeRosa, 696 F.3d 1302; see O.R. at 1499 (\u201c[Y]our consideration must be\n\nlimited to a moral inquiry into the culpability of the defendant, not an emotional response\n\nto the evidence.\u201d). \u201cAs a general rule, we presume that juries follow [limiting]\n\ninstructions.\u201d United States v. Lane, 883 F.2d 1484, 1498 (10th Cir. 1989).\n\n       Finally, unlike in Dodd, in which the State \u201cwent to the extraordinary length of\n\neliciting [a death penalty] recommendation from six, and perhaps seven, . . . witnesses,\u201d19\n\nthe sentence recommendations presented at Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial were more akin to a\n\n\u201cone-off or a mere aside\u201d than \u201ca drumbeat.\u201d 753 F.3d at 997.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n         In Dodd, six of the State\u2019s witnesses recommended death in response to a\nquestion posed by the prosecutor, while a seventh witness \u201cincluded her recommendation\nof the death sentence in the statement she read to the jury.\u201d 753 F.3d at 997.\n\n\n                                               47\n\f                       2) The aggravating case\n\n       Although the jury found that only one aggravating circumstance\u2014the HAC\n\naggravator\u2014existed beyond a reasonable doubt, the aggravating case against Mr.\n\nUnderwood was relatively strong. The existence of the HAC aggravator in itself provides\n\na relatively strong basis for the death penalty as compared to the other aggravating\n\ncircumstances (apart from the continuing threat aggravator). See Dodd, 753 F.3d at 998\n\n(\u201cThis was also a significantly weaker case for the death penalty. Unlike seven of our\n\nprecedents, the jury did not find the [HAC] aggravating circumstance.\u201d). Moreover, \u201cthe\n\nevidence of [this] aggravating circumstance[] was substantial.\u201d Lockett, 711 F.3d at\n\n1240. The jury heard Mr. Underwood\u2019s confession, in which he acknowledged the\n\nplanned nature of the crime, exhibited comprehension of its wrongfulness, and recounted\n\nits brutal details, including J.B.\u2019s resistance, his feelings of sexual arousal, and his efforts\n\nto decapitate her.20\n\n\n       20\n          See State\u2019s Trial Exhibit 162 at 27 (\u201cI certainly planned this out, I mean I\u2019d been\nthinkin\u2019 about it for at least a month.\u201d); id. at 41 (\u201cI know what I did was wrong, and . . . I\nknow that I deserve to be punished for it.\u201d); id. at 56 (\u201c[W]hen she first came in [to the\napartment], it was like oh, now\u2019s my chance, but then, you know, then I had to say no, I\ncan\u2019t do it, and I just kinda struggled with myself the whole times she was in there.\u201d); id.\nat 59 (\u201c[T]hen finally I was just like you know, either do it or tell her to get the hell out of\nthe apartment, . . . and finally I did it.\u201d); id. at 61 (\u201cI whacked her with [a cutting board],\nand she\u2019s . . . like ouww, and started crying and she\u2019s like, oh God I\u2019m sorry . . . so I\nwhacked her again, and she jumped up, and . . . I couldn\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t knock her\nout.\u201d); id. at 62 (\u201c[A]fter I hit her a couple times, I finally just had to, you know jump up\nand grab her, and . . . I couldn\u2019t believe how strong she was. I could barely hold her\ndown.\u201d); id. at 63 (\u201c[O]nce I . . . finally got her down to the ground, . . . we struggled.\n[I]t took me probably fifteen, twenty minutes to kill her.\u201d); id. (I was, kinda sittin\u2019 on her\n. . . clamping . . . my hand on her [face and nose].\u201d); id. at 67-68 (\u201cI was gonna try to\nhave sex with her . . . , but the way she was like laying right on the floor I couldn\u2019t really\nget to her very good.\u201d); id. at 69-71 (\u201cAnd so I was like . . . I\u2019m just gonna go ahead and\n\n                                                48\n\f       Finally, in contrast to Dodd, guilt in this case, established in large part by Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s own confession, \u201cwas . . . as clear cut as in cases in which we have ruled\n\nthat victim recommendations were harmless.\u201d 753 F.3d at 998.\n\n                      3) The mitigating case\n\n       Mr. Underwood\u2019s mitigating case, as summarized above, contained substantial\n\ntestimony addressing multiple mitigating factors. In closing argument, defense counsel\n\nemphasized the strongest parts of the case for mitigation. Counsel emphasized Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s various mental health issues, repeatedly describing him as \u201ca disturbed and\n\nconflicted, mentally ill young man when he committed this terrible crime.\u201d Trial Tr. Vol.\n\nX at 2536; see also id. at 2538-39, 2541-43, 2546. Counsel also referenced the testimony\n\ngiven by the defense team\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. Martin Kafka\u2014that proper treatment\n\ncould potentially lessen the effects of Mr. Underwood\u2019s psychiatric disorders and\n\nparaphilias. Id. at 2545; see Trial Tr. Vol. IX at 2262-65.\n\n       The mitigation case, in particular the evidence pertaining to his psychiatric\n\ndisorders and his amenability to treatment, was not, as we have said in another case, \u201cless\n\nthan compelling.\u201d Selsor v. Workman, 644 F.3d 984, 1027 (10th Cir. 2011) (finding a\n\nBooth error harmless under Brecht in part based on the weakness of the mitigating\n\nevidence, which consisted of testimony from one jail employee and four prison\n\nemployees, two of whom conceded that the habeas petitioner\u2019s prison record was simply\n\ndrag her into the tub and behead her . . . . [S]o I started sawing at her neck . . . . I went to\nher spine and I, just sawed and sawed and sawed, and could not get through that last.\u201d);\nid. at 71 (\u201cI was disgusted at first, but then once I was climbing down on top of her,\nholding her down and choking her, I got aroused again.\u201d).\n\n\n                                                49\n\f\u201ca little better than average\u201d (quotations omitted)). Although stronger than the evidence\n\nin Selsor, Mr. Underwood\u2019s evidence was not sufficiently compelling as to put us in\n\n\u201cgrave doubt\u201d as to the Booth error\u2019s harmlessness, in light of the strength of the\n\naggravating circumstance in this case. See (John) Grant, 727 F.3d at 1017 (\u201cTo be sure,\n\n[the petitioner] did respond with evidence of his amenability to treatment and evidence\n\nabout his troubled childhood. But even viewed in its totality the case against him\n\nremained considerable.\u201d).21 \u201cLastly, the jury was properly instructed on the use of\n\nmitigating evidence and its role in the sentencing deliberations,\u201d further reducing the\n\nlikelihood that the admission of J.B.\u2019s parents\u2019 testimony prejudiced Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\ndefense. Selsor, 644 F.3d at 1027 (alterations and quotations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n       21\n          Mr. Underwood\u2019s three expert witnesses generally agreed that he suffered from\na variety of psychological and psychiatric disorders, including, most notably: schizotypal\npersonality disorder, the less severe of the two types of bipolar disorder, depression,\nanxiety, and social phobia. Trial Tr. Vol. IX at 2178-82, 2251-62, 2327-31. The State\u2019s\nrebuttal expert, who did not personally evaluate Mr. Underwood but reviewed the defense\nexperts\u2019 work, testified that he \u201cwould . . . defer to their diagnoses\u201d and \u201cha[d] no reason\nto doubt those diagnoses and their competence as examiners.\u201d Trial Tr. Vol. X at 2472-\n73.\n        But even with these diagnoses, \u201c[the defense experts\u2019] testimony never indicated\nthat Mr. [Underwood]\u2019s [mental health issues] caused his behavior to be \u2018impulsive\u2019 or\n\u2018aggressive\u2019 in a way that would meaningfully explain his involvement in [J.B.\u2019s]\nmurder[],\u201d thus reducing the mitigating force of the mental health evidence in this case.\nSee (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d at 922 (emphasis in original). Indeed, Dr. Kafka testified\nthat, \u201ceven though [Mr. Underwood\u2019s violent and sexual] thoughts themselves were\nimpulsive-like . . . in that . . . they were just vibrating back and forth in his mind, . . . he\nput them into a plan of action that was planned out and not impulsive.\u201d Trial Tr. Vol. IX\nat 2261 (emphasis added). And Mr. Underwood self-reported on a sexual compulsive\ndisorder questionnaire that he \u201cha[s] much control and [is] usually able to stop or divert\nsexual obsessions with some effort and concentration.\u201d Id. at 2226.\n\n                                               50\n\f                                            ****\n       Based on the foregoing, Mr. Underwood is not entitled to relief because the Booth\n\nerror here does not warrant automatic reversal and, applying Brecht, \u201c[g]iven that this\n\ncase contains similarly strong evidence [as in previous cases] against the defendant and\n\nyet a comparatively muted pair of pleas, we are hard pressed to see how we could,\n\nfaithful to our precedent, find . . . reversible error.\u201d (John) Grant, 727 F.3d at 1017.\n\n5. Jury\u2019s Weighing of Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances\n\n       Mr. Underwood contends that he is entitled to relief from his death sentence\n\nbecause it was unconstitutionally imposed without a jury finding beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the HAC aggravator outweighed the mitigating evidence. The OCCA rejected\n\nthis claim on the merits. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 246.\n\n       In addressing this claim, we begin with the relevant legal background and\n\nadditional factual and procedural background. We then examine the OCCA\u2019s merits\n\ndecision under \u00a7 2254(d) and conclude that it was not contrary to\u2014or an unreasonable\n\napplication of\u2014Supreme Court law or based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Mr. Underwood\u2019s\n\nclaim that the state trial court failed to require the jury to find the aggravating\n\ncircumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       a. Legal background\n\n       We first provide a general overview of the reasonable doubt standard\u2019s\n\napplicability to capital sentencing facts. We then discuss Matthews v. Workman, 577\n\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\fF.3d 1175 (10th Cir. 2009), in which this court previously considered and rejected the\n\nsame challenge to Oklahoma\u2019s capital sentencing scheme before us in this appeal.\n\n              i. Overview\n\n       The Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and the Sixth Amendment right\n\nto a jury trial, taken together, entitle a criminal defendant to \u201ca jury determination that he\n\nis guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\u201d Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 476-77 (2000) (brackets and quotations\n\nomitted). In Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that \u201cany fact that increases the penalty\n\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\u201d is an element that \u201cmust be\n\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 490.\n\n       In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), the Supreme Court applied the Apprendi\n\nrule in invalidating Arizona\u2019s capital sentencing system. Arizona\u2019s system authorized\n\njudges to make the factual finding necessary for imposing the death sentence\u2014that at\n\nleast one aggravating circumstance existed. Ring, 536 U.S. at 597-98. The Court held\n\nthat \u201c[b]ecause Arizona\u2019s enumerated aggravating factors operate as the functional\n\nequivalent of an element of a greater offense [by increasing the maximum penalty], . . .\n\nthe Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury.\u201d Id. at 609 (citations and\n\nquotations omitted).22\n\n\n       22\n         The Arizona scheme invalidated in Ring required judge-made findings of\naggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. 536 U.S. at 597. In contrast,\nOklahoma\u2019s scheme requires jury-made findings that (1) at least one aggravating\ncircumstance exists and (2) the aggravating circumstance(s) outweigh the mitigating. Mr.\nUnderwood nevertheless contends that Oklahoma\u2019s scheme violates Apprendi because,\nalthough the jury must make the first determination beyond a reasonable doubt, it need\n\n                                               52\n\f       The Supreme Court likewise applied Apprendi in invalidating Florida\u2019s capital\n\nsentencing scheme in Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616 (2016). Under Florida\u2019s scheme,\n\nthe trial court alone made the findings necessary for imposing the death penalty: that (1)\n\n\u201csufficient aggravating circumstances exist,\u201d and (2) \u201cthere are insufficient mitigating\n\ncircumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u201d Hurst, 136 S. Ct. at 622\n\n(quotations omitted). But the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Hurst only referenced the first\n\nof these required findings: \u201cFlorida\u2019s sentencing scheme, which required the judge alone\n\nto find the existence of an aggravating circumstance, is therefore unconstitutional.\u201d Id. at\n\n624 (emphasis added). The Court thus did not address whether the second of the required\n\nfindings\u2014that mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating\n\ncircumstances\u2014is also subject to Apprendi\u2019s rule.\n\n              ii. Matthews v. Workman\n\n       In Matthews, this court rejected an Apprendi challenge to Oklahoma\u2019s capital\n\nsentencing scheme. Under Oklahoma\u2019s scheme, the death penalty may not be imposed\n\n\u201c[u]nless at least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances . . . is [found by a\n\nunanimous jury beyond a reasonable doubt] or if it is found that any such aggravating\n\ncircumstance is outweighed by the finding of one or more mitigating circumstances.\u201d\n\nOkla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.11. The Matthews petitioner sought habeas relief based on the\n\ntrial court\u2019s punishment stage jury instructions, arguing that the jury should \u201chave been\n\nnot do so as to the second. Even though Oklahoma\u2019s scheme does not allow judge-made\nfindings, we consider Ring in addressing Mr. Underwood\u2019s claim because the Apprendi\nrule entitles a defendant to a determination by the jury and also to a determination beyond\na reasonable doubt of \u201cany fact . . . that increases the maximum penalty for a crime.\u201d\nApprendi, 530 U.S. at 476.\n\n                                               53\n\finstructed that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating factors\n\noutweighed the mitigating.\u201d Matthews, 577 F.3d at 1195 (emphasis in original).\n\nConsidering the issue de novo, we held that the weighing of aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances under Oklahoma\u2019s scheme is not subject to the Apprendi rule because it \u201cis\n\nnot a finding of fact . . . but a highly subjective, largely moral judgment regarding the\n\npunishment that a particular person deserves.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted).23\n\n       b. Relevant facts\n\n       In the punishment stage of Mr. Underwood\u2019s trial, the trial court instructed the\n\njury in accordance with Oklahoma\u2019s capital sentencing scheme:\n\n              If you unanimously find that one or more of the aggravating\n              circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt, the death\n              penalty shall not be imposed unless you also unanimously\n              find that any such aggravating circumstance or circumstances\n              outweigh the finding of one or more mitigating\n              circumstances. Even if you find that the aggravating\n              circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstance, you\n              may impose a sentence of imprisonment for life with the\n              possibility of parole or imprisonment for life without the\n              possibility of parole.\n\nO.R. at 1494. The jury was therefore not instructed to find that the aggravating\n\ncircumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n       23\n          Two state supreme courts have taken the opposite approach in applying\nApprendi to the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in capital\nsentencing. See Hurst v. State, 202 So. 3d 40, 44 (Fla. 2016) (interpreting Hurst as\nrequiring that \u201call critical findings necessary before the trial court may consider imposing\na sentence of death must be found unanimously by the jury,\u201d including \u201cthe finding that\nthe aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating circumstances\u201d); Rauf v. State, 145 A.3d\n430, 434 (Del. 2016) (invalidating Delaware\u2019s capital sentencing scheme in part because\nit did not require a jury to find that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating\ncircumstances beyond a reasonable doubt).\n\n                                              54\n\f       c. OCCA and federal district court decisions\n\n       In his appeal to the OCCA, Mr. Underwood argued that the failure to instruct the\n\njury to find the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt constituted reversible error. Underwood, 252 P.3d at 246.\n\nThe OCCA denied Mr. Underwood\u2019s Apprendi claim on the merits, citing Matthews. Id.\n\nMr. Underwood then sought federal habeas relief, which the district court denied.\n\nUnderwood, 2016 WL 4059162, at *31.\n\n       d. Analysis\n\n       We review the OCCA\u2019s decision under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and conclude that it was not\n\ncontrary to\u2014or an unreasonable application of\u2014clearly established Supreme Court\n\nlaw.24 Matthews forecloses us from concluding otherwise. Matthews held that\n\nOklahoma\u2019s capital sentencing scheme does not violate Apprendi even though it does not\n\nrequire the jury to find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating\n\ncircumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. Matthews, 577 F.3d at 1195. We therefore\n\ncannot hold that the OCCA contradicted or unreasonably applied Apprendi in\n\nadjudicating Mr. Underwood\u2019s claim. See Meyers, 200 F.3d at 720 (\u201cWe are bound by\n\nthe precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary\n\ndecision by the Supreme Court.\u201d (quotations omitted)); see also Lockett, 711 F.3d at\n\n1254-55 (holding that an analogous Apprendi claim was \u201cforeclosed by our decision . . .\n\nin . . . Matthews\u201d).\n\n       24\n         Mr. Underwood does not\u2014nor do we\u2014identify any \u00a7 2254(d)(2) unreasonable\nfactual determination underlying the OCCA\u2019s adjudication of the Apprendi claim.\n\n\n                                             55\n\f       Mr. Underwood makes much of the Supreme Court\u2019s references in Hurst to\n\njudicial weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances under the Florida scheme\n\nit invalidated. Hurst post-dates the OCCA\u2019s decision and thus cannot serve as clearly\n\nestablished federal law for purposes of our review under AEDPA. See Greene v. Fisher,\n\n565 U.S. 34, 38 (2011) (explaining that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201crequires federal courts . . . to\n\nmeasure state-court decisions against [the Supreme] Court\u2019s precedents as of the time the\n\nstate court renders its decision.\u201d (quotations omitted)). We do not treat it as such in\n\nconsidering whether the OCCA\u2019s decision was reasonable under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We\n\ninstead address whether Hurst enables us to overrule Mathews, which forecloses Mr.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s argument that the OCCA\u2019s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\n\napplication of the preexisting Supreme Court decisions, absent en banc reconsideration.\n\n       Hurst does not supply a superseding contrary Supreme Court decision that would\n\nallow us to overrule Matthews. Although Hurst contains some preliminary discussion of\n\nFlorida judges\u2019 authority to both find and weigh aggravating circumstances\n\nindependently of the jury in capital cases, it invalidated Florida\u2019s scheme specifically \u201cto\n\nthe extent [it] allow[s] a sentencing judge to find an aggravating circumstance . . . that is\n\nnecessary for imposition of the death penalty.\u201d 136 S. Ct. at 622, 624 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause Hurst did not directly address Apprendi\u2019s application to the weighing of\n\naggravating and mitigating circumstances, it does not contravene Matthews.\n\n6. Cumulative Error\n\n       Finally, Mr. Underwood contends that the errors he alleges, taken together,\n\ndeprived him of a fair trial. \u201cBecause the OCCA [found no error and thus] did not\n\n\n                                              56\n\fconduct a cumulative-error analysis . . ., we must perform our own de novo, employing\n\nthe well-established standard found in Brecht.\u201d (Donald) Grant, 886 F.3d at 955. \u201cIn\n\ndoing so, we inquire whether the identified harmless errors, in the aggregate, \u2018had a\n\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n(alterations omitted) (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637)). We include the following in our\n\ncumulative error analysis: (1) the alleged prosecutorial misconduct\u2014the remarks about\n\nshaving;25 and (2) the conceded Booth violation\u2014the sentence recommendations.\n\n       Mr. Underwood has failed to show that the alleged prosecutorial misconduct and\n\nthe conceded Booth error, taken together, suffice to meet Brecht\u2019s standard for showing\n\nprejudice. As discussed above, the aggravating evidence presented in this case\u2014\n\nincluding the gruesome details of Mr. Underwood\u2019s plans and the actual murder as\n\ndescribed in his confession\u2014was particularly strong, whereas the mitigating evidence\n\nwas not. And, although we have recognized that \u201charmless individual errors . . . may be\n\ncollectively more potent than the sum of their parts, \u201cMr. [Underwood] makes no\n\nargument that the two errors that we have assumed here possess any particularized\n\n\n\n       25\n          In our above discussion of the prosecutorial misconduct claim, we did not\ndetermine whether the alleged error constituted actual error but instead concluded that\nany potential error did not merit habeas relief because it did not rise to the level of a due\nprocess violation. If the alleged prosecutorial misconduct constituted actual error, we\nmust include it in our cumulative error analysis. Cargle v. Mullin, 317 F.3d 1196, 1207\n(10th Cir. 2003) (\u201c[C]laims of prosecutorial misconduct . . . require a showing of\nfundamental unfairness in order to provide habeas relief, unless they involve the violation\nof specific constitutional rights . . . . [S]uch claims should be included in the cumulative-\nerror calculus if they have been individually denied for insufficient prejudice.\u201d). For\npurposes of our cumulative error analysis, we assume without deciding that the alleged\nprosecutorial misconduct constituted actual error and proceed accordingly.\n\n                                              57\n\fsynergies.\u201d Id. at 956 (quotations omitted). Mr. Underwood is therefore not entitled to\n\nhabeas relief based on their cumulative effect on the jury\u2019s sentencing determination.\n\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Underwood\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for writ\n\nof habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n                                             58\n\f",
