            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION &amp; ORDER\nCONBOY, District Judge:\nThis ease is before the Court for resen-tence, on remand from the Court of Appeals. We explicitly incorporate by reference in its entirety our previous opinion and order, reported at 788 F.Supp. 756 (S.D.N.Y.1992).\nThere, we concluded, that because there were several victims of the defendant\u2019s misconduct, in all instances' derived from his abuse of the warder-inmate relationship, the only applicable grouping guideline is \u00a7 3D1.2(d), which states that grouping should occur when the offense level is determined largely upon a discrete measure of aggregate harm or the offense is ongoing and the offense guideline is written to cover the misconduct. Since the bribery guideline was not written to cover abuse of the warder-inmate relationship, we determined that no grouping analysis was necessary. Indeed, statutory rape of an inmate, conduct analogous to abuse of the warder-inmate relation ship found here, is explicitly excluded as groupable behavior under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). In light of this, and recent refinements of guidelines application doctrine previously announced in United States v. Kim, 896 F.2d 678, 683-85 (2d Cir.1990), we dispensed with any multicount analysis in this highly idiosyncratic case as unnecessary.\nIn United States v. Alter, 985 F.2d 105 (2d Cir.1993) [hereinafter, \u201cOpinion\u201d], the Court of Appeals held that, having drawn analogies between- Alter\u2019s criminal acts and several federal offenses, this Court was obliged initially to engage in the multi-count analysis of the Sentencing Guidelines, using the analogous offenses that were found by this Court to most accurately capture'Alter\u2019s criminal conduct towards Donald V., Gary 0., and Jose L. Opinion at 108. As calculated by the Court of Appeals, a multi-count analysis would result in an offense level increase (above the base offense level of 10) of, at most, four levels for these acts. Opinion at 108. The Court of Appeals stated that this four-level increase, when augmented by the three-level increase for the disruption of Manhattan House and the federal corrections system, would yield an offense level of 17. The resulting sentencing range would be 24-30 months. Opinion at 108.\nThe Court of Appeal's made clear, however, that this should not be construed as a holding that the appropriate sentence for Alter must lie within the 24-30 month range.. The district court was explicitly told that, upon remand, it retained broad discretion to depart upwards beyond the seven levels dictated by application of the grouping rules to the analogous offenses identified.\n\u201cSuch further departures,\u201d the Court of Appeals stated, \u201care specifically contemplated in [United States v.] Kim.\" Quoting Kim, the Court noted:\nIf the offense of conviction or the other acts of misconduct warranting a departure are accompanied by aggravating factors not adequately considered by the Commission in setting the guideline ranges for the offense of conviction or various acts of misconduct considered under \u25a0 the multi-count analysis, a departure beyond the aggregate guideline range would still be available despite the use of multi-count analysis. \u25a0\nOpinion at 108 (quoting United States v. Kim, supra at 685).\n*552The Court of Appeals further stated that \u201cAnd, of course, the district judge remains free to reevaluate all aspects of the sentencing that were not ruled on in this appeal.\u201d Opinion at 108.\nThe multi-count analysis is included in the Sentencing Guidelines to guide district courts in sentencing defendants who have been convicted of multiple offenses. See United States \u25a0 Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1-1.5, Introductory Commentary. In the context of upward departures, the purpose of engaging in the multi-count analysis is to protect a defendant from'receiving a harsher sentence than the defendant would have received if he had actually been convicted of the conduct that formed the basis for the upward departure. Opinion at 108. In this case, the Court has held that the conduct upon which its upward departures were based' \u2014 -i.e., the conduct apart from the bribery of Donald V. to which Alter pleaded gtiilty \u2014 was Alter\u2019s provision of drugs to that resident and his misconduct with respect to Gary O. and Jose L. Once the most analogous federal offenses to these acts of misconduct- are thus identified, the Court may then undertake the first step, of its measurement of any upward departure. That step is the application of the Sentencing Guidelines grouping rules and its multi-count analysis to the conduct upon which an upward departure may be based, so as to deter.mine what sentence would be mandated by the grouping rules had the misconduct found by the Court actually resulted in convictions. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1-3D1.5*\nThe grouping analysis commences with a determination as to the number of groups of offenses that exist. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.1(a)(1). A group of offenses consists of one or more convictions (or, in the context of an upward departure, analogous offenses) which should be lumped, or \u201cgrouped,\u201d together pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. Questions on whether to group particular offenses turn, in the main, on whether or not the acts of misconduct in question either arose from the same transaction or are readily consolidated.\nIn this case, the Court,- based upon detailed factual findings, referred to various federal offenses as the most closely analogous to Alter\u2019s misconduct: for Alter\u2019s misconduct toward both Jose L. and Gary 0., sexual abuse of a ward, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(b); for Alter\u2019s provision of drugs to Donald V., provision of drugs, providing or possessing contraband in prison, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a), (b)(4), (d)(1)(D). (4/30/92 Tr. 4-6). For purposes of the multi-count analysis, the Court must first determine how to group the four factually established acts of misconduct: Alter\u2019s actual conviction for bribing Donald V., his sexual abuse misconduct relating to Jose L., his sexual abuse misconduct relating to Gary 0., and his drug distribution misconduct relating to Donald V.\nThese four discrete wrongs are properly organized in three different groups. The bribery conviction regarding Donald V; is properly grouped with Alter\u2019s provision of drugs to the same resident. The two offenses relate to the same victim and are part of the same scheme or plan. ' See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(b) (offenses having the \u201csame victim\u201d and \u201cconstituting the same scheme or plan\u201d should be grouped together). Indeed, this Court expressly found that the bribe involved a promised exchange of sex for drugs. See Alter, supra, 788 F.Supp. at 763. Apart from the grouping of the two \u201coffenses\u201d regarding Donald V., the Court finds that the \u201cremaining acts of misconduct\u201d found by the Court may not be grouped further. Alter\u2019s misconduct regarding each of the three residents each constitutes a separate group for the purposes of the multi-count analysis.\n*553The three groups of \u201coffenses\u201d do not qualify for further grouping under any of the subsections of \u00a7 3D1.2. The bribery conviction and the sex \u201coffenses\u201d towards Jose L. and Gary O. do not have the \u201csame victim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3D1.2(a) and (b). Whereas the United States has- been found by this Court to be the victim of Alter\u2019s bribery of Donald V., residents Jose L. and Gary O. were themselves the victims of Alter\u2019s sexual abuse towards these residents themselves. Hence, the various offenses would not have the \u201csame victim\u201d and could not be grouped under (a) or (b). Even if the Court were to find that the Government is the sole victim, the statutes protect different interests, with the bribery statute seeking to prevent official corruption, see Alter, supra, 788 F.Supp. at 767, and, the sexual abuse statute seeking., to prevent disruption of prison authority, such that grouping the offenses may be improper. Cf Kim, supra at 687 (counterfeiting and alien offenses may not be grouped, even though the United States is technically the victim, because the statutes protect different interests).\nQuite apart from the resolution of the \u201csame victim\u201d issue, the- \u201coffenses\u201d regarding each resident cannot be grouped under (a) or (b) because they do not involve the \u201csame act or transaction\u201d and are not \u201cconnected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.\u201d See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a), (b). Alter, by design, segregated his misconduct toward each resident. Each resident was pursued separately, privately, and at different times. Having gone to such pains to segregate his misconduct, Alter may not now be heard to claim that the misconduct constituted the \u201csame act or transaction\u201d or represented part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan.\u201d See \u00a7 3D1.2, application note (two counts of assault, committed on two successive days against the same officer, cannot be grouped under subsection (a)); application note 4 (two counts of rape arising from the rape of the same person on different days cannot be grouped under subsection (b)).\nNor can the group of offenses relating to each resident be grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) or (d). The .misconduct regarding Jose L. and Gary O. cannot be treated as a specific offense characteristic or an adjustment to the bribery guideline applicable to Alter\u2019s bribery of Donald V., making \u00a7 3D1.2(c) inapplicable. Finally, the analogous \u201coffenses\u201d cannot be grouped under subsection (d) because the offense levels for these offenses are not determined by the \u201ctotal amount of harm or loss\u201d or \u201csome other measure of aggregate harm.\u201d See \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Both the 1992 and 1988 versions of 3D1.2(d) recognize the episodic, discrete, and unquantifiable nature of the analogous \u201coffenses\u201d found by this Court and specifically exclude these offenses from its operation. See \u00a7 3D1.2(d&gt; (\u00a7 2A3.3, the guideline applicable to sexual abuse of a Ward, and \u00a7 2P1.2, the guideline applicable to the provision of contraband in prison, are excluded from this grouping rule). (4/3092 Tr. at 46). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendment to the guidelines in 1989, making bribery a groupable offense under subsection (d), see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1, Amendment 121, sought to eliminate anomalies in the guidelines calculation based upon monetary bribes paid as part of a common scheme or plan and did not purport to mandate that a bribery offense must be grouped with other offenses pursuant to subsection (d). See United States v. Stephenson, supra, 921 F.2d at 441 (under the 1989 Sentencing Guidelines, bribery \u201ccount\u201d relating to one corporation, regarding which defendant was acquitted, was not grouped with the bribery conviction relating to another corporation and provided the Court with a proper basis for departure). Rather, the question remains whether these \u201coffenses\u201d can be measured on the basis of the \u201ctotal amount of harm or loss\u201d or \u201csome other measure of aggregate harm.\u201d Alter\u2019s compartmentalized misconduct towards each separate resident precludes such a finding.\nThe next step under the multi-count analysis is to determine the offense level, including adjustments pursuant to Parts A, B, and C of Chapter Three, for each of the three groups of offenses. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Dl.l(a)(2); \u00a7 3D1.3, application note 1. The first group consists of offenses involving Donald V.: the bribery conviction and the \u201coffense\u201d of providing a controlled substance to Donald V., with offense levels of 12 and eight, respectively. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1, \u00a7 3C1.1 (base *554level ten plus two points for obstruction). (4/30/92 Tr. at 4-6). That group thus has an adjusted offense level of 12. See \u00a7 3D1.3, application note 2 (the group receives the offense level of the highest constituent part).\nThe second and third groups consist of one \u201coffense\u201d each. These are the sexual abuses of Jose L. and Gary 0., respectively. Both of these groups have adjusted offense levels of 11. These offense levels are comprised of base level 9 (see \u00a7 2A3.3), plus a two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of trust, (see \u00a7 3B1.3).\nThe last step in the multi-count analysis is to determine the collective offense level for all three groups. This figure is ascertained by using the table provided in \u00a7 3D1.4. See \u00a7\u00a7 3Dl.l(a)(3), 3D1.4. Because all three groups have total offense levels within four levels of one another, there are, pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.4(a), three separate \u201cunits,\u201d translating into a three-level upward adjustment above the offense levels of the highest group. Adding the three levels for grouping to the Donald V. group \u2014 which at level 12 is the highest group \u2014 yields an adjusted offense level of 15. When reduced by the two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the adjusted offense level equals 13.\nAs noted earlier, the Court of Appeals approved this Court\u2019s imposition of three additional points for the disruption of Manhattan House and the federal corrections system caused' by Alter\u2019s misconduct as halfway house director. See Opinion at 108. The addition of those three level results in an adjusted offense level of 16, which corresponds to a guideline range of 21-27 months.\nWe now turn to the matter of upward departure.\n1. \u201cAggravating Factors\u201d Not Reflected in the Analogous Offenses Used for the Multi-Co.unt Analysis\nAs noted by the Court of Appeals, to depart under Kim beyond the adjusted offense level of 16 fixed by the preceding multi-count analysis, the Court simply needs to identify aggravating circumstances previously found by this Court but not adequately reflected in the analogous offenses employed by the Court. See Opinion at 108; United States v. Kim, supra, 896 F.2d at 685; United States v. Baez, 944 F.2d 88, 90 (2d Cir.1991). The scope of such an additional departure beyond the adjusted offense level need only be reasonable in light of the aggravating factors identified. See United States v. Baez, supra, at 90-91.\nWe now find, on reconsideration, that the analogous offenses chosen by the Court, although accurately describing certain or partial aspects of Alter\u2019s criminal conduct, do not fully capture significant aggravating circumstances previously identified by the Court.\n(a) Offenses Relating to Donald V.\nThe group of \u201coffenses\u201d pertaining to Donald V. \u2014 namely,-the bribery conviction and the additional \u201coffense\u201d of supplying contraband to an inmate \u2014 does not take account of significant aggravating aspects of Alter\u2019s criminal conduct towards the resident which the Court found in its opinion. The federal offense of bribery accurately captures the fact that federal halfway house director Alter illegally exacted a quid pro quo that related to the business of the halfway- house; the federal crime of supplying contraband to an inmate accurately captures the additional fact that Alter provided a prohibited object to a federal inmate. These two offenses do not at all take account, however, of other highly pertinent facts emphasized by the Court in its decision. Nor, predictably, are these aggravating facts taken into account in either the guideline applicable to bribery offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1, or the guideline applicable to the offense of supplying contraband to an inmate, \u00a7 2P1.2(a)(3), a guideline which has a base level of six and which applies .to controlled substances other than narcotics. These unaccounted-for factors include:\n(i) the fact that Donald V. was known to Alter to be a recovering drug user, and that \u201cAlter affirmatively aggravated Donald V.\u2019s drug abuse problem when his duty required him to mitigate it,\u201d Alter, supra, 788 F.Supp. at 772.; and that the provision of drugs by Alter to the resident inflicted a *555\u201cgrievous injury\u201d upon Donald V., id. at 772;\n(ii) the fact that the provider of the contraband to resident Donald V. was not just any person \u2014 for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a) is applicable to any person who brings a \u201cprohibited object\u201d into a prison, regardless of whether the person is a prison official or employee, or an outside visitor \u2014 but the prison director himself and thus .a person with direct oversight over and fiduciary responsibility towards resident Donald V.;\n(iii) the fact that the nature of the contraband was not just any \u201cprohibited object,\u201d such as a transistor radio, or a less destructive illicit substance, such as an alcoholic beverage, but was instead valium tablets and dangerous and addictive narcotic substances, including heroin .and cocaine. The Court found that Alter himself distrib- . uted parcotic drugs to Donald V. and aided and abetted Donald V. in obtaining narcotic drugs, including by giving the resident cash with which to buy heroin and cocaine. Id., at 769, 772;\n(iv) the fact that Alter\u2019s provision of contraband did not happen on just one occasion, but on multiple occasions. These included (A) Alter\u2019s provision of valium tablets on August 24, 1988, to Donald V. prior to the incident at Alter\u2019s apartment; (B) Alter\u2019s provision of additional valium tablets, and marijuana, during the incident that night at the apartment; (G) Alter\u2019s provision of cash to Donald V. the following morning to enable the resident to purchase heroin and cocaine; (D) Alter\u2019s pro* vision of valium tablets to Donald V. en route to -the Fire Island location prior to the weekend of August 27; (E) Alter\u2019s provision of valium tablets to Donald V. during the weekend at Fire Island; and (F) Alter\u2019s provision of cash to the resident following the weekend to enable the resident to purchase heroin and cocaine; and finally\n(v) the fact that Alter\u2019s provision of drugs and access to drugs was part and parcel of a protracted pattern of harassment and improper \u201cpredatory\u201d behavior by Alter of resident Donald V., in which Alter \u201cexploited Donald V.\u2019s drug dependence.\u201d Id., 'at 769-70.\nBecause these factors are aggravating in nature, and because they are not taken into account by the bribery guideline or the guideline applicable to the providing of contraband to a prison inmate, the Court is free to depart above the level set by application of multiple-count analysis to these offenses. See Opinion at 108; see also Kim, supra, 896 F.2d at 685. In light of the extreme nature of this uncaptured conduct, a most substantial additional departure beyond the level set by the multi-count' analysis is wholly appropriate.\n(b) Offenses Relating to Jose L. and Gary O.\nThe analogous offense chosen by the Court for Alter\u2019s misconduct toward Jose L. and Gary O. is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(b), a misdemean- or which prohibits sex between a ward and a warden. The guideline applicable to this offense is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.3 As with the pair of offenses utilized in calculating the offense level applicable to the Donald V. group, this offense- and corresponding guideline section (with a base level of nine) captures only a portion of the aggravating conduct in which the Court found Alter to have engaged. ' The statute and guideline do accurately capture, in the case of both-residents, the fact that a person with \u201ccustodial, supervisory, or disciplinary authority\u201d over a ward in official detention \u201cknowingly engaged in a sexual act\u201d with that ward. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(b). They do not at all take account, however, of other highly pertinent facts emphasized by the Court in its decision.\nMost important, 18 U.S.C.- \u00a7 2243(b) does not at all take into account the critical fact that \u2014 as the Court found and described in detail in its opinion \u2014 Alter used wholly improper means in his attempts to obtain the participation in sexual acts of the two residents. See Alter, supra, 788 F.Supp. at 768 (\u201cAlter tried to and did exploit halfway house residents Donald V., Jose L., and Gary O. in a deeply disturbing manner, in that the custodial character of the institution was used to further Alter\u2019s sexual interests\u201d). Indeed, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.3 are ap-*556plieable to instances that include consensual sexual relations between a warden and a resident \u2014 relations where sexual gratification was the sole object of each participant. That was clearly not the case here. Instead, the Court found .that Alter\u2019s conduct became,\nan emotional and psychological invasion of the residents\u2019 personal space, privacy, and identity. Taking advantage of the singularly restrictive environment of' a correctional facility, Alter was able to and did manipulate the residents in several ways conducive to furthering his sexual -desires. He implicitly relied upon or explicitly used the controls, procedures, and rules of the halfway house for these purposes in an entirely unique conflict of-interest- Alter\u2019s perversion of the warder/inmate relationship at Manhattan House calls for an upward departure that adequately reflects this unique form of functional exploitation.\nAlter, supra, 788 F.Supp., at 768-69. Among these unaccounted for -aspects of Alter\u2019s conduct are:\n(i) the fact that Alter exploited his \u201cunlimited physical access to the residents,\u201d allowing him \u201cto intrude at will at all hours upon the personal lives of its residents\u201d; the fact that Alter had \u201cuntrammelled access to the personal files of the residents, and the most personal, sensitive, and intimate medical, psychological, and family information found there\u201d; and the fact that Alter exploited each resident\u2019s \u201cunique vulnerability\u201d to being \u201cremanded to prison or disciplined\u201d for prior disciplinary infractions. Id. For Jose L., this entailed taking advantage of the fact that Jose L. had falsified a leave pass; for Gary 0.', this entailed taking advantage of the fact that Gary O. had disregarded Alter\u2019s instructions. Id. Based on this conduct, the Court termed Alter\u2019s behavior \u201cpredatory.\u201d Id.\n(ii) the fact that Alter \u201charassed [Gary O. and Jose L.] through his constant access to them, his ability to control their movements, and his knowledge of their personal weaknesses,\u201d Alter, supra, 788 F.Supp., at 769. For Gary 0., these included \u201cforcing Gary O. to work late at night and waking him up when Gary O. tried to avoid him\u201d; \u201cprob[ing] into Gary O.\u2019s personal relationship with his father\u201d so as to demonstrate that \u201che wielded power over Gary 0.\u201d; and \u201cverbal harassment of the resident.\u201d Id., at 770. For Jose L., these included abuse of the fact that Alter had \u201ceffective control over Jose L.\u2019s movements,\u201d which \u201cenabled Alter to speak to him without interruption and without concern that Jose L. would leave Alter\u2019s office. Alter\u2019s control over Jose L. directly facilitated the sex that Alter sought.\u201d Id.\nThese aggravating factors were not taken into account'in the statute used by the Court as the most analogous and thus are not factored into the offense level generated by use of the multhcount analysis. Thus, the Court is free to depart above this level on the basis of these findings. See Opinion at 108; see also Kim, supra, 896 F.2d at 685. As in the instance of the Donald V. \u201cgroup\u201d of offenses, the extreme nature of this uncaptured conduct justifies a substantial additional departure beyond the level set by the multi-count analysis.\n2. Selection of Other Analogous Offenses\nAs an alternative approach to fashioning a sentence that properly reflects the gravity of Alter\u2019s misconduct, this Court is free, as the Court of Appeals observed, to \u201creevaluate,\u201d inter alia, its previous choice of analogous offenses and to adopt new analogous offenses which more fully capture the aggravating circumstances identified by the- Court. Opinion at 108; see United States v. Baez, supra at 90 (district judge would have been free to analogize to kidnapping rather than witness tampering on remand); United States v. Sprecher, 988 F.2d 318, 321 (2d Cir.1993) (citing the Court of Appeals\u2019 Alter decision for proposition that, on remand, District Court is free to impose sentence it believes to be appropriate based upon its \u201cintimate knowledge of the circumstances of this case\u201d).\nWe believe that with respect to the group of offenses relating to Donald V., the offense of providing of narcotics to an inmate is also an appropriate analogy. The narcotics guideline, \u00a7 2P1.2(a)(2), would apply 13 levels to Alter\u2019s provision of narcotics to Donald *557V. The Court would be authorized to impose a two-level adjustment for Alter\u2019s status as director of Manhattan House, which is analogous to the two-level enhancement in \u00a7 2P1.2(b)(l) for Department of Justice employees. The total of 15 levels would more adequately reflect Alter\u2019s \u201cunique betrayal of trust\u201d and his infliction of \u201cgrievous injury\u201d upon the resident by providing drugs to Donald V. than the Court\u2019s alternative use of the other contraband provision, \u00a7 2P1.2(a)(3). See Alter, supra, 788 F.Supp. at 772.\nFor the other two residents, Alter\u2019s insistent pressure to gain their consent to sex makes the extortion guideline, \u00a7 2B3.2, \u25a0 a useful analogy. Even though Alter\u2019s pursuit of sex, rather than property, precluded any prosecution for extortion, (see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2), the extortion guideline provides a most apt analogy in the departure context. See United States v. Ahuja, 936 F.2d 85 (2d Cir.1991) (analogy to the bribery guideline to guide upward departure where- defendant could not be charged with bribery was proper). The Court explicitly found that Alter\u2019s encounters with Jose L. and Gary O. were \u201cnot consensual\u201d and that Alter engaged in \u201cpredatory\u201d behavior towards them. Id. at 770. Using the extortion guideline for Jose L. and Gary 0., results in two \u201coffenses\u201d with a base level of 18.\nThe multi-count analysis applied to these new analogies would result in an offense level of 24. Again, the offenses with respect to each resident would be a separate group. See \u00a7\u00a7 3Dl.l(a)(l), 3D1.2. The group of \u201coffenses\u201d for Jose L. and Gary O. would each have a two-point adjustment for Alter\u2019s abuse of trust, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 20 for each group. See \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1(a)(2), 3B1.3; \u00a7 3D1.3, application note 1 (add adjustments from Parts A, B, and C of Chapter Three to each group). The group of \u201coffenses\u201d relating to Donald V. would have a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 17 for that group.. For the three groups, all of which have point totals within four levels of one another, the Court would add three levels to the highest group for an adjusted offense level of 23. See \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1(a)(3), 3D1.4.\nThis total of 23 would be augmented by three levels for Alter\u2019s disruption of Manhattan House and the federal corrections system, and reduced by two levels for acceptance of responsibility. The Court thus finds that the record supports an alternative final adjusted offense level of 24, corresponding to a sentencing range of 51-63 months. The 1988 version of the Sentencing Guidelines permits reduction of the adjusted offense level by two levels for acceptance of responsibility; subsequently, the 1992 Guidelines have authorized such a reduction of three levels where a defendant \u201ctimely provid[es] complete information concerning his own involvement in the offense,\u201d or \u201ctimely notifies] authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\u201d Compare U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (1988) with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (1992). Here, only the two-point reduction is appropriate. In pleading guilty, Alter acknowledged only a small core of the criminal conduct later found by the Court: Alter admitted providing a weekend pass to Donald V. in exchange for the resident\u2019s participation in sexual relations. Alter in pleading guilty did not provide \u201ccomplete information\u201d concerning Donald V. Nor did his plea \u201cpermit! ] the court to allocate its resources efficiently,\u201d as the limited admissions in his plea necessitated a lengthy Fatico hearing. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) (1992); see also \u00a7 3E1.1, application note 1(a) (factors to be considered in determining whether to award three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility include \u201cnot falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable\u201d). Furthermore, the Court\u2019s finding that Alter obstructed justice counsels against awarding the full three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, application note 4.\nUnder either authorized approach, the Court is free to impose the same 60-month sentence upon remand.\nThis Court, in imposing sentence in April, 1992, made extensive findings of fact, see Alter, supra, 788 F.Supp. 756, passim, and considered comprehensive argument by both the Government and the defense. (4/30/92 Tr. 27). When the Court departed to an offense level of 25 (57-71 months) and imposed a 60-month sentence on April 30, 1992, *558it stated 'that it had considered all intermediate offense levels below this offense level and found them inadequate to reflect Alter\u2019s criminal conduct. (4/30/92 Tr. at 4-5), and we- so state again on reconsideration. Based upon the previously selected analogous offenses, and the aggravating factors identified, we depart to an offense level of 25 and a guideline range of 57-71 months.\n\nConchision\n\nIn light of the foregoing, and for the reasons stated in our previous written Opinion and Order and during the initial sentencing proceeding, a substantial sentence is clearly warranted in this case in light of the uniquely pernicio\u00fas conduct of defendant Alter. The Court of Appeals has expressly accorded this Court ample discretion in resentencing Alter, providing that there is compliance with the multi-count analysis prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. We accordingly, exercise this discretion to reimpose the same sentence of 60 months imprisonment that the Court had previously imposed. We believe after a comprehensive review of the protracted and complex record of this ease, that any prison term of shorter duration would constitute a grave miscarriage of justice.\nSO ORDERED.\n\n The 1992 Sentencing Guidelines apply in the absence of ex post facto problems in which case the 1988 Sentencing Guidelines, in their entirety, govern. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4), (5); United States v. Stephenson, 921 F.2d 438, 440-41 (2d Cir.1990); United States v. Alter, 788 F.Supp. 756, 766 n. 11 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (Conboy, J.). In view of potential ex post facto problems, our citations to the guidelines refer to the guideline provisions in effect both at the time of the offense and at the time of sentence. Unless specifically indicated, the guidelines provisions for the two years do not differ in any material respect.\n\n",
