Twenty-five-year-old Taylor Karas, with her\n\nco-defendants, kidnapped and robbed a seventy-nine-year-old man in Ohio. After Karas lured the\n\nvictim to her hotel room, her co-defendants arrived at the hotel, armed. Using the victim\u2019s car, the\n\ndefendants drove the victim to an ATM and multiple stores, used the victim\u2019s credit card to make\n\npurchases, and ultimately abandoned him at a store in Indiana. Karas was charged with and\n\nconvicted of kidnapping and sentenced to forty-two months\u2019 incarceration, well below the U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) range.\n\n       Karas now appeals her sentence, arguing that it is procedurally and substantively\n\nunreasonable. Because the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range and did not\n\nabuse its discretion in declining to grant Karas\u2019s request for a two-level minor role reduction, we\n\nfind that the sentence is procedurally reasonable. Because the district court did not abuse its\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\ndiscretion in weighing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find that the sentence is substantively\n\nreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       Twenty-five-year old Taylor Karas and her then-boyfriend, James Marriott, agreed to rob\n\na seventy-nine-year-old man, identified as J.P. Karas had previously dated J.P.\u2019s grandson and\n\nhad borrowed money from J.P. in the past. On October 6, 2016, Karas texted J.P. and asked to\n\nborrow money. J.P., expecting a sexual encounter in return, agreed and suggested they meet at a\n\nlocal restaurant. After Karas asked that they meet at the Super 8 Motel in Vandalia, Ohio, J.P.\n\ndrove to the motel, parked his Ford Explorer in the lot, and entered Karas\u2019s room.\n\n       Shortly thereafter, Karas texted Marriott that J.P. had arrived. Marriott, brandishing a gun,\n\nburst into the room, along with a second man, Andrew Azzalina. Marriott and Azzalina searched\n\nJ.P. and took approximately $300 and his phone. Marriott also took J.P.\u2019s credit and debit cards\n\nand demanded that J.P. tell him his personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d). When J.P. said he\n\ncould not remember his PIN, Marriott cocked his gun and threatened to kill J.P., calling him a liar.\n\n       Despite not knowing the PIN, Marriot decided to take J.P. to an ATM to withdraw money.\n\nMarriott, Azzalina, and Karas found the keys to J.P.\u2019s car and forced J.P. into the front seat. With\n\nKaras and Marriott in the back seat, Azzalina drove to a bank in Englewood, Ohio. When J.P.\n\nrepeated that he could not remember his PIN, Marriott inserted the card into the ATM and\n\nthreatened to kill him while Karas attempted to guess the PIN.\n\n       Unable to withdraw money, Marriott, Azzalina, and Karas transported J.P. to a Dollar\n\nGeneral in Lewisburg, Ohio. While Marriott and Karas went inside to purchase a cell phone and\n\na box of Honey Buns, totaling $97, with J.P.\u2019s credit card, Azzalina remained in the car with J.P.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\n           Azzalina then drove to the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods store in Richmond, Indiana, crossing\n\nstate lines. Again, Marriott and Karas went into the store while Azzalina held J.P. in the car.\n\nMarriott and Karas attempted to charge $1,400 worth of merchandise to J.P.\u2019s credit card. The\n\nstore clerk requested to see the credit card holder\u2019s driver\u2019s license to complete the purchase, so\n\nMarriott called Azzalina to bring J.P. into the store. J.P. signed for the purchase and, at some point\n\nduring the transaction, mouthed \u201ccall the police\u201d to the store clerk.                       Fearing that J.P. had\n\nsuccessfully requested help from the store clerk, Karas and Marriott fled the store, leaving J.P.\n\nbehind. Karas, Marriott, and Azzalina then drove J.P.\u2019s car back to Ohio.\n\n           Police arrested Marriott and Azzalina a few days later. Karas turned herself in on October\n\n20, 2016. As relevant here, a federal grand jury indicted Karas on October 27, 2016 for aiding and\n\nabetting a kidnapping.1 Karas pled guilty to kidnapping on January 20, 2017.2\n\n           The Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommending\n\na Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 incarceration. Applying Guidelines \u00a7 2A4.1 for\n\nkidnapping, the PSR established that Karas had a base offense level of 32. The PSR also found\n\ntwo separate two-level enhancements applicable. One two-level enhancement was for the use of\n\na dangerous weapon, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(3). The second enhancement was a\n\nvictim-related adjustment applicable when the defendant knew or should have known that the\n\noffense involved a vulnerable victim. The PSR did not adjust for Karas\u2019s role in the offense\n\nbecause she was not the organizer of the criminal activity; nor was she a \u201cminor participant\u201d due\n\nto her \u201csignificant role\u201d in the criminal activity. Finally, applying a three-level downward\n\n\n\n1\n  Karas was only named in counts one and five of the indictment. Count one was for aiding and abetting a kidnapping,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1) and (2). Count five was for aiding and abetting the knowing possession and\ntransport across state lines of a stolen motor vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313 and Pinkerton v. United States,\n328 U.S. 640 (1946).\n2\n    Karas also pled guilty to count one and the government agreed to dismiss count five.\n\n                                                           3\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\nadjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the PSR calculated a total offense level of 33. The\n\nPSR also determined that Karas was within criminal history category II because of prior, relatively\n\nminor drug- and alcohol-related charges. With the adjusted offense level of 33 and the criminal\n\nhistory category of II, the Guidelines sentence range was 151 to 188 months.             The PSR\n\nrecommended a downward departure to a sentence of seventy-two months under the \u00a7 3553(a)\n\nfactors, based in part on Karas\u2019s commitment to a drug addiction treatment program.\n\n       At the request of both parties, Karas\u2019s sentencing hearing was continued for over a year\n\nand she remained out on bond during this time. Prior to the sentencing hearing, the parties\n\nsubmitted supplemental memoranda detailing the aggravating and mitigating factors related to\n\nKaras\u2019s sentencing. Karas submitted two sentencing memoranda to the district court.\n\n       In the first memo, filed in August 2017, Karas argued that a reduced sentence was\n\nwarranted because: (1) she acted under duress because Marriott was so controlling; (2) she was\n\nunder the influence of opiates; (3) she had previously been the victim of an attempted kidnapping;\n\n(4) the victim had provoked the offense; (5) she had a history of sexual abuse and addiction; and\n\n(6) she was experiencing anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Without directly linking her argument\n\nto the facts of this case, she also discussed research showing that community-based treatment\n\nprograms were more effective in decreasing recidivism than prison-based programs. As to the\n\nGuidelines role reduction, she contended that she had \u201ca limited, though not minor role, in the\n\noffense\u201d and asked the court \u201cto permit the fully allowable reduction based upon her minimal\n\nrole.\u201d DE 85, Sealed Def.\u2019s Sentencing Mem., Page ID 414. She made no other mention of the\n\nGuidelines\u2019 minor role provision in her memorandum and did not dispute the PSR\u2019s finding that\n\nher conduct did not warrant a minor role downward adjustment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\n       In a supplemental memorandum filed in March 2018, Karas argued that her \u201cpost-\n\nconviction rehabilitation\u201d warranted \u201ca further departure from the U.S. Probation Officer\u2019s\n\nadjustment.\u201d DE 109, Sealed Def.\u2019s Supp. Sentencing Mem., Page ID 512\u2013513. She noted that\n\nshe had completed in-patient drug treatment and had remained in recovery, excluding a relapse in\n\nDecember 2016. She also contended that a departure was warranted because she had worked at\n\nRed Lobster since September 2017, received good performance reviews, and been enrolled in\n\ncommunity college, working toward an associate degree in counseling, since January 2017. Karas\n\nalso argued in the supplemental memo that her conduct was aberrant.           She explained this\n\n\u201cmisadventure\u201d occurred and \u201ccircumstances got out of control\u201d because of her fear of and loyalty\n\nto Marriott. Id. at 515. She further argued that she had diligently continued to work and attend\n\nschool despite a pregnancy \u201cend[ing] during its second trimester in December 2017\u201d and\n\nsubsequent medical treatment. Id. at 513\u201314.\n\n       In a motion for substantial assistance filed in May 2017 (following the close of Marriott\u2019s\n\ntrial), the government requested that the court grant a downward departure from the Guidelines for\n\nKaras\u2019s cooperation against Marriott.\n\n       The government also filed a sentencing memorandum in May 2017, urging the district\n\ncourt to impose a term of imprisonment upon Karas but \u201cnot the lengthy sentence that the advisory\n\nGuidelines suggest.\u201d DE 119, Gov\u2019t Sentencing Mem., Page ID 556. The government noted that\n\nKaras had serious addiction issues, as indicated by her history of drug- and alcohol-related\n\nmisdemeanor convictions, and that these issues contributed to her involvement in the kidnapping.\n\nWhile her generally positive performance on bond hinted that she could become a better person,\n\nthe government explained, the high risk of her becoming unwilling or unable to deal with these\n\nissues in the future would \u201cunquestionably\u201d lead her to reoffend. Id. at 557. The government\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\ncontended that the risk of recidivism posed a danger to the community and her son. Although\n\nKaras played an \u201cintegral role,\u201d the government found that some downward departure was\n\nwarranted because Karas\u2019s involvement and criminal history were less troubling than those of her\n\nco-defendants. Id. at 557\u201358.\n\n       The district court held a sentencing hearing on May 4, 2018. Karas took \u201cfull responsibility\n\nfor [her] actions\u201d and acknowledged that she abused the victim\u2019s trust by putting him \u201cinto a\n\nsituation [she] knew wasn\u2019t the safest and that could turn out bad.\u201d DE 154, Sentencing Hearing\n\nTr., Page ID 717\u201318. She apologized not only to the victim, but also to her son and grandparents,\n\nwho cared for her son. She explained that her drug addiction motivated her conduct in this case,\n\nbut that she had since \u201cbeen clean for 17 months,\u201d was caring for her son, holding down a job, and\n\npursuing a certificate in chemical dependency counseling that she planned to complete by the fall\n\nsemester of the next year. Id. at 718\u201321.\n\n       The district court then turned to an analysis of the Guidelines. Largely in accordance with\n\nthe PSR, the district court calculated a base offense level of 32 for aiding and abetting a\n\nkidnapping, plus two levels for use of a dangerous weapon, and a three-level downward adjustment\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a total offense level of 31. The district court\n\nthen rejected Karas\u2019s argument for a minor role adjustment, finding that she was \u201cby no measure\n\n. . . a minor player in what happened,\u201d because the kidnapping would not have occurred if Karas\n\nhad not \u201clured the victim to the hotel\u201d under false pretenses. Id. at 726\u201327. The district court also\n\ndecided against applying the two-level vulnerable victim enhancement recommended in the PSR.\n\nFinally, considering Karas\u2019s criminal history, the district court found that the advisory range was\n\n121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\n         The district court next considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As to mitigating factors, the\n\ndistrict court considered Karas\u2019s troubled background and current circumstances\u2014including a\n\ndifficult home life, experience of sexual abuse as a child, and long history of substance abuse and\n\nminor \u201cdrug fueled\u201d offenses as an adult. Id. at 727\u201329. The district court also noted that Karas\n\nwas under the influence of drugs during the kidnapping and felt controlled by Marriott. The district\n\ncourt considered Karas\u2019s progress, \u201cremorse,\u201d and \u201cinsight\u201d while out on bond. Id. at 725. It noted\n\nher devotion to her young son, recent employment, completion of in-patient treatment and ongoing\n\noutpatient treatment, her enrollment in a junior college\u2019s substance abuse certificate program, and\n\nher goal of becoming a social worker.3\n\n         The court balanced these mitigating factors with the public interest in \u201cpunishment that\n\nboth promotes respect for the law, while at the same time not minimizing or trivializing the\n\noffense.\u201d Id. at 733. Describing the offense as \u201cserious,\u201d the district court explained that Karas\n\ntook advantage of her relationship with the victim by luring him into an armed confrontation with\n\nyoung men. Id. at 732\u201333. The district court explained that Karas could become a danger to the\n\npublic if she relapsed because \u201cshe is subject to being manipulated and to committing criminal\n\nconduct.\u201d Id. at 733.\n\n         Summarizing its analysis, the district court gave Karas \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d in\n\nconcluding \u201cthat her rehabilitation was sincere.\u201d Id. at 735\u201336. But the court still emphasized that\n\n\u201ca sentence of some length\u201d was warranted because of the seriousness of the offense, the public\u2019s\n\ninterest in fair punishment, and the nature of the crime. Id. at 735\u201336. The district court sentenced\n\n\n\n3\n  The district court rejected Karas\u2019s request for departures from the Guidelines based on her claims that the victim was\nculpable, her conduct was aberrant, and that she acted under coercion or duress from Marriott. But the district court\nindicated it would consider Marriott\u2019s influence over Karas, as well as the out-of-character nature of Karas\u2019s conduct,\nas part of its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. In addition, the court indicated that it considered Karas\u2019s cooperation with the\ngovernment. On appeal, Karas does not challenge these aspects of the district court\u2019s Guidelines or sentencing\nanalysis.\n\n                                                           7\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\nKaras to forty-two months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release and ordered\n\nrestitution jointly and severally with her co-defendants. The court concluded by asking Karas\u2019s\n\ncounsel whether there were any procedural or substantive objections to the sentence, and Karas\u2019s\n\ncounsel replied that there were none.\n\n        Karas timely appealed her sentence.\n\n                                                   II.\n\n        When reviewing a sentence for procedural reasonableness, we generally utilize the abuse-\n\nof-discretion standard. United States v. Coleman, 627 F.3d 205, 211 (6th Cir. 2010). We consider\n\nwhether \u201cthe district court \u2018correctly calculat[ed] the applicable Guidelines range\u2019 which are the\n\n\u2018starting point and initial benchmark\u2019 of its sentencing analysis.\u201d United States v. Bolds, 511 F.3d\n\n568, 579 (6th Cir. 2007) (alteration in original) (quoting Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49\n\n(2007)). In considering the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range, we review the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. Id. While the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s ultimate decision about a person\u2019s role is a legal conclusion, such a decision relies\n\nheavily \u201con factual nuances.\u201d United States v. Washington, 715 F.3d 975, 983 (6th Cir. 2013).\n\nThus, because \u201cthe district court is in the best position to know whether [the defendant] was a\n\nleader\u201d or played a minor role, we review the district court\u2019s conclusion about a defendant\u2019s role\n\nunder a \u201cdeferential\u201d standard of review. Id. (\u201cAccordingly, we hold that . . . review of the legal\n\nconclusion that a person is an organizer or leader . . . is also deferential.\u201d).\n\n        If we determine that the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s sentencing decision [is] procedurally sound, we\n\nmust \u2018then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion standard.\u2019\u201d Bolds, 511 F.3d at 581 (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 51).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       On appeal, we review the sentence imposed by the district court \u201cfor both procedural and\n\nsubstantive unreasonableness.\u201d      Coleman, 627 F.3d at 210.        \u201cOur review of sentences for\n\nreasonableness is not to be confused with the district court\u2019s task to impose a sentence that is\n\n\u2018sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u2019 of sentencing set forth in\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Bolds, 511 F.3d at 578. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\non either ground, we affirm.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n       On appeal, Karas primarily claims that her sentence was procedurally unreasonable\n\nbecause she should have received a two-level minor role reduction under the Guidelines. We find\n\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant the minor role reduction.\n\n       Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b) allows for a range of adjustments for defendants who are\n\n\u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant in the criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3. It therefore provides for a two-level decrease \u201c[i]f the defendant was\n\na minor participant in [the] criminal activity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The two-level minor role reduction\n\napplies to those who are \u201cless culpable than most other participants in the criminal activity.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 5. \u201cAlthough [a] defendant may be less culpable than some of his\n\ncoconspirators, this does not require a finding that he was substantially less culpable than the\n\nothers.\u201d United States v. Miller, 56 F.3d 719, 720 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\n       Before the district court, the defendant bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence, the factors that justify a minor role reduction. Id. The district court\u2019s inquiry into\n\nthe minor role reduction is \u201cheavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(C). The district court may consider a non-exhaustive list of factors,\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\nincluding the defendant\u2019s: (1) understanding of the \u201cscope and structure\u201d of the crime;\n\n(2) participation in the planning or organizing of the crime; (3) \u201cexercise[]\u201d of decision-making\n\nauthority or \u201cinfluence[]\u201d over the exercise of decision-making authority; (4) acts performed and\n\nresponsibility or discretion over those acts; and (5) possible benefit from the crime. U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 3(C)(i)-(v).\n\n       Based on these factors and Karas\u2019s perfunctory request for the reduction, we conclude that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the minor role adjustment. Here, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, Karas took advantage of her relationship with the victim to lure him to the\n\nhotel rather than the restaurant where he wished to meet. As Karas herself explained, she put the\n\nvictim \u201cinto a situation [she] knew wasn\u2019t the safest and that could turn out bad.\u201d DE 154,\n\nSentencing Hearing Tr., Page ID 718. While she may not have exactly predicted the \u201cextent\u201d of\n\nthe criminal activity, id., she intentionally lured him to the hotel \u201cfor the purpose of robbing\u201d him,\n\nDE 50, Plea Agreement, Page ID 155. Karas failed to present other evidence that she did not grasp\n\nthe goals of the criminal activity.\n\n       In the statement of facts attached to the plea agreement, Karas admitted that she actively\n\nparticipated in each phase of the criminal activity. She \u201ccontacted [J.P.] and asked to borrow\n\nmoney from him.\u201d Id. at 155. She notified Marriott when J.P. arrived at the hotel. She was one\n\nof \u201cthe three robbers [who] then moved [J.P.] from the motel to the Ford Explorer\u201d and later\n\n\u201cforced [J.P.] to accompany them various places in western Ohio and eastern Indiana.\u201d Id. At the\n\nbank, she provided possible PIN numbers to access the victim\u2019s bank account.\n\n       She also stood to profit from the criminal activity. She and Marriott entered the Dollar\n\nGeneral and made purchases on the victim\u2019s credit card. At Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods in Indiana, she\n\nand her co-defendants \u201cmade [J.P.] use his credit card and purchase clothing and other items for\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\nthem.\u201d Id. These facts demonstrate that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding\n\nthat a minor role reduction was not warranted.\n\n       In her brief on appeal, Karas presents more detail about her role in the offense than she did\n\nin the district court. Her main argument is that \u201cit was Marriott who developed this plan and\n\nexecuted it,\u201d and it was Marriott who possessed the gun. CA6 R. 31, Sealed Appellant Br., at 26.\n\nShe contends that while she \u201cwas the connection to the victim in this case, it was not her idea to\n\nrob him.\u201d Id. Karas provides no citations to the record for these assertions. And even if she did\n\npresent more support, it would not warrant a minor role reduction. \u201cA defendant does not become\n\na minor participant simply because others planned a scheme and made all the arrangements for its\n\naccomplishment.\u201d Miller, 56 F.3d at 720. Here, even if Karas \u201cmay be less culpable than some\n\nof her coconspirators,\u201d a finding that she was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the others\u201d is not\n\nwarranted. As described above, Karas admitted that she understood the plan to rob the victim and\n\nwas an active participant in each stage of the kidnapping.\n\n        The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a minor role reduction\n\nbased on the record before it.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       A sentence is substantively reasonable when it is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\n\nto comply with the purposes\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). United States v. Presley, 547 F.3d 625, 630\u2013\n\n31 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201cA sentence may be considered substantively\n\nunreasonable when the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on\n\nimpermissible factors, fails to consider relevant sentencing factors, or gives an unreasonable\n\namount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d United States v. Conatser, 514 F.3d 508, 520 (6th Cir.\n\n2008). On appeal, we consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances, including the extent of any\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\nvariance from the Guidelines range.\u201d Bolds, 511 F.3d at 581 (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 51). Even\n\nif we reasonably would have imposed a different sentence, we must \u201cafford due deference to the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s decision to determine the appropriate length of defendant\u2019s sentence, so long as it\n\nis justified in light of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d United States v. Herrera-Zuniga, 571 F.3d\n\n568, 591 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n       The defendant bears the burden of showing substantive unreasonableness. United States\n\nv. Smith, 881 F.3d 954, 960 (6th Cir. 2018). A sentence within the Guidelines range is presumed\n\nto be substantively reasonable. Herrera-Zungia\u00b8 571 F.3d at 590. When a below-Guidelines\n\nsentence is imposed, the defendant\u2019s burden, while not impossible to meet, is \u201ceven more\n\ndemanding.\u201d United States v. Curry, 536 F.3d 571, 573 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n       Section 3553(a)(2) also directs the sentencing court to consider the need for the sentence\n\nimposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, provide just punishment, afford adequate\n\ndeterrence, and protect the public. A proper sentence, in other words, may not minimize the\n\nseriousness of the defendant\u2019s conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 778 F.3d 515, 519\n\n(6th Cir. 2015) (reversing a sentence of one night for possession of child pornography because of\n\nthe district court\u2019s \u201cfailure to take into account the seriousness of Defendant\u2019s particular crime\n\n[and] the lack of serious consideration for the need for deterrence.\u201d).\n\n       Karas does not meet this \u201cheavy burden.\u201d United States v. Greco, 734 F.3d 441, 450 (6th\n\nCir. 2013). The district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when\n\nit imposed a sentence that fell significantly below the Guidelines range. Karas briefly claims on\n\nappeal that her sentence should be shortened because of several considerations, namely her post-\n\noffense rehabilitation, acceptance of responsibility, care for her son, education, and employment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\nBut the district court expressly weighed these factors and did not abuse its discretion in considering\n\nthem, so a reversal of the sentence imposed by the district court is not warranted.\n\n       The district court explained that the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of the offense were\n\negregious and counseled for \u201ca committed sentence of some length.\u201d DE 154, Sentencing Hearing\n\nTr., Page ID 736; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cThe court . . . shall consider the nature and\n\ncircumstances of the offense . . . .\u201d). Taking advantage of her personal relationship with the\n\nseventy-nine-year-old victim, Karas lured him to a hotel knowing that he would be robbed. She\n\nplaced him in danger\u2014kidnapping him with the help of two men, one of whom was armed. As a\n\nresult of the kidnapping, the district court noted, the victim suffered ongoing emotional distress.\n\n       The district court also did not minimize the seriousness of the offense. See Robinson,\n\n778 F.3d at 519. The district court weighed \u201cthe interest of the public and the Court,\u201d DE 154,\n\nSentencing Hearing Tr., Page ID 736, \u201cconsidered the interests of the public in preventing Ms.\n\nKaras and others similarly situated from committing similar crimes in the future,\u201d id. at 734, and\n\nconsidered the deterrent effect of the sentence, id.\n\n       In addition to considering the nature and circumstance of the crime and the need to provide\n\njust punishment, the district court paid close attention to the \u201chistory and characteristics of the\n\ndefendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). In doing so, it weighed many of the allegedly mitigating\n\ncircumstances that Karas now argues required the imposition of a shorter sentence. The district\n\ncourt noted Karas\u2019s history of addiction and relatively minor substance-related criminal history\n\nbut lauded her efforts to recover from addiction and her work helping others in recovery. The\n\ncourt also considered Karas\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, assistance in her co-defendant\u2019s case,\n\nfamily situation, employment status, and education efforts.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fNo. 18-3459, United States v. Karas\n\n\n       The cases cited by Karas imply that a district court may reduce a sentence based upon such\n\nfactors\u2014including post-conduct rehabilitation and substance abuse. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nHairston, 502 F.3d 378, 381\u201383 (6th Cir. 2007); United States v. Maddalena, 893 F.2d 815, 817\u2013\n\n818 (6th Cir. 1989). That is exactly what the district court did here. These cases do not require\n\nthat sentencing courts reduce a sentence by a specific, proscribed amount; rather, they provide\n\ncourts with discretion to reduce sentences when appropriate. Karas\u2019s argument that the court did\n\nnot adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors fails to rebut the presumption of substantive\n\nreasonableness.\n\n                                               IV.\n\n       Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence of forty-two\n\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f",
