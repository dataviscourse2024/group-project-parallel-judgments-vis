Vinagro Corp. Waste Transporter Application\n\n                             ENTRY REGARDING MOTION\n\nTitle:        Motion for Summary Judgment (Motion 4)\nFiler:        Agency of Natural Resources\nAttorney:     Jordan E. Gonda\nFiled Date:   December 16, 2013\n\nResponse in Opposition filed on 01/22/2014 by Attorney David M. Pocius for Appellant J.P.\nVinagro Corp.\nReply filed on 02/20/2014 by Attorney Jordan E. Gonda for Interested Person Agency of Natural\nResources\n\nThe motion is DENIED.\n        On October 24, 2012, Appellant J.R. Vinagro Corp. (Appellant) applied for a commercial\nwaste hauler permit with the Waste Management and Prevention Division of the Department\nof Environmental Conservation of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (ANR). In a\nNovember 30, 2012 letter, ANR notified Appellant of its intent to deny Appellant\u2019s application\nbased on multiple past environmental violations as required by 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6605f(a)(2). This\nletter notified Appellant of its opportunity to demonstrate its rehabilitation pursuant to\n\u00a7 6605f(f). In its December 20, 2012 letter, Appellant asked ANR to reconsider its intent to\ndeny the permit application. To show rehabilitation, Appellant explained that some of the\nviolations it had disclosed were not actually committed by Appellant and described how\nAppellant had hired several employees with experience in environmental compliance. On May\n15, 2013, ANR, notified Appellant that it had failed to establish rehabilitation and formally\ndenied the application. Appellant timely appealed that decision to this Court.\n       ANR now moves for summary judgment in its favor, asking first that the Court find as a\nmatter of law Appellant was disqualified under 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6605f(a)(2) and second that\nAppellant failed to establish rehabilitation under \u00a7 6605f(f). Appellant opposes the motion,\narguing that a factual dispute exists regarding both issues and therefore ANR is not entitled to\nsummary judgment.\n        The Court will grant summary judgment to a moving party only if that party\ndemonstrates that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d V.R.C.P. 56(a); V.R.E.C.P. 5(a)(2). We will \u201caccept as\ntrue the [factual] allegations made in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, so long\nas they are supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material,\u201d and we will give the non-\n\fIn re J.R.

Mylan Labs.,\nInc., 2004 VT 15, \u00b6 15, 176 Vt. 356.\n        A commercial waste hauler must obtain a permit in order to transport waste within the\nState of Vermont. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6607a(a). If certain disqualifying criteria are met, ANR must deny\nan application for a waste transportation permit. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6005f(a). These disqualifying\ncriteria are separated under the statute into two categories: (1) conviction of any of a list of\ndisqualifying offenses within the 10 years preceding the application1; or (2) the \u201c[commission\nof] more than one violation of environmental: statutes; rules; orders; certifications; or permits,\nissued by an jurisdiction, which have the potential to significantly harm the public health, public\nsafety or the environment, giving due consideration to the size and scope of the applicant\u2019s\nbusiness operations.\u201d 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6605f(a)(2).\n        An applicant for a permit covered by \u00a7 6605f must make certain disclosures. First, the\napplicant must disclose \u201c[t]he record of any convictions identified in subsection (a)\u201d within the\n10 years prior to the date of the application. Id. at \u00a7 6605f(b)(3). An applicant must also\ndisclose \u201call civil and administrative penalties issued against the applicant by any state or\nfederal authority, in the five years immediately preceding the filing of the application, which\nresulted from a finding of violation or assurance of discontinuance, relating to the collection,\ntransportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of solid waste or hazardous waste by the\napplicant . . . .\u201d Id. at \u00a7 6605f(b)(4). Based entirely on these disclosures by Appellant, ANR\ndetermined that Appellant, or its principal Joseph R. Vinagro, had committed more than one\nenvironmental violation which had the potential to, or had in fact, significantly harmed the\npublic health, public safety, or the environment. ANR asks this Court to make the same finding\non summary judgment.\n        In appealing an ANR act or decision, a person aggrieved by that act or decision is\nentitled to a de novo hearing before this Court. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 8504(a), (h). We cannot, therefore,\nsimply defer to ANR\u2019s prior determinations but must rather make our own findings of fact. If\nwe had sufficient undisputed facts before us to find as a matter of law that Appellant was\ndisqualified by \u00a76605f(a), summary judgment in ANR\u2019s favor would be appropriate. Here,\nhowever, Appellant raises several disputes of material fact which prevent the Court from\nresolving this case on summary judgment.\n        First, Appellant argues that a material fact is in dispute as to whether Appellant\u2019s\ndisclosed violations had the potential to significantly harm the public health, public safety, or\nthe environment, \u201cgiving due consideration to the size and scope of the applicant\u2019s business\n\n1\n  These offenses are: murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, extortion, arson, burglary, larceny and\nembezzlement, forgery and fraud, possession and control of drugs and related offenses, trafficking in alcoholic\nbeverages, the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, criminal provisions of federal\nantitrust laws related to solid waste, criminal provisions of any federal or state environmental protection laws or\nrules relating to solid waste, obstruction of justice, securities fraud, alteration of motor vehicle identification\nnumbers, or the unlawful manufacture, purchase, use, or transfer of firearms. 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6605f(a)(1). Although\nANR focused on part (2) of subsection (a), Appellant\u2019s filings appear to mention past criminal convictions under\neither federal or Rhode Island environmental laws. (See Caisse Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 12\u201315, filed Jan. 2, 2014.) Such a\nconviction, if within the 10 years prior to the application being filed would seemingly fall under \u00a7 6605f(a)(1)(O)\n(\u201cthe criminal provisions of any federal or state environmental protection laws or rules relating to solid waste\u201d).\n\fIn re J.R. Vinagro Corp., No. 76-6-13 Vtec (Entry Order on Mot. for Summ. J.) (04-7-14) Pg. 3 of 4.\n\noperations.\u201d2 ANR\u2019s own guidance document, \u201cGuidance for Background Review Analysis of\nEnvironmental Violations Under 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6605f(a)(2),\u201d published August 11, 1999, recognizes\nthat a determination of whether a violation has the potential to significantly harm the\nenvironment requires a fact-based case-by-case approach considering the type of waste and\ntype of violation involved. This is not to say, as Appellant suggests, that certain violations do\nnot, by their very nature, have the potential to significantly harm the environment as a matter\nof law. Here, however, because other facts are in dispute, we need not determine whether\nAppellant has committed any such violations at this time.\n       The 1999 ANR Guidance document provides little to no actual guidance on how to\ninterpret the legislative requirement that ANR, or this Court on appeal, give \u201cdue consideration\nto the size and scope of the applicant\u2019s business operations.\u201d Thus, given the limited record\nbefore us we cannot determine that there are sufficient undisputed facts to determine that\nAppellant\u2019s application must be denied based on \u00a7 6605f(a)(2).\n        Furthermore, even assuming Appellant is disqualified under subsection (a), the question\nof whether an applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation under \u00a7 6605f(f) is a fact-specific\ndetermination. While ANR found that Appellant had failed to adequately demonstrate\nrehabilitation, we do not have sufficient undisputed facts before the Court to make that\ndetermination on summary judgment.\n        For the reasons set forth above, ANR\u2019s motion for summary judgment is DENIED. This\nmatter is set for a one-day merits hearing on May 21, 2014 at the Chittenden County\nCourthouse in Burlington, VT. Although ANR had moved to have venue for the hearing changed\nto Barre, VT that motion was rendered moot by the parties\u2019 stipulated amended scheduling\norder, as noted in the Court\u2019s December 23, 2013 entry order.\n\nElectronically signed on April 07, 2014 at 09:32 AM pursuant to V.R.E.F. 7(d).\n\n\n\n_________________________________________\nThomas G. Walsh, Judge\nSuperior Court, Environmental Division\n\n\n\n2\n  Appellant also argues that certain violations that it admits it was required to disclose were not actually\n\u201ccommitted\u201d by Appellant because they were imputed to Appellant by law, or because Appellant arguably did not\nviolate the law but simply entered into a consent decree. The Court will not entertain Appellant\u2019s attempt to\nconvince the Court that it is not truly responsible for its past violations. We also recognize, as did ANR in its reply,\nthat Appellant refers to certain violations in its summary judgment opposition that it apparently did not disclose as\npart of its application. These violations can and should be considered in determining whether Appellant is\ndisqualified under subsection (a) and whether Appellant is rehabilitated under subsection (f). Appellant also\nargues that violations outside of the five year reporting window for civil and administrative penalties (subsection\n(b)(4)) cannot be considered under \u00a7 6605f(a)(2). We find no language in the statute to indicate that consideration\nof disqualifying environmental violations under subsection (a)(2) is limited to the five years preceding the\napplication.\n\fIn re J.R.
