WISSER, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n\n                Appellant Lamont R. Brown pleaded guilty to an indictment accusing him of\n\naggravated kidnapping and two indictments accusing him of aggravated sexual assault. The district\n\ncourt adjudged him guilty in each case and assessed punishment at imprisonment for fifty-five years,\n\nas called for in a plea bargain agreement. Appellant filed general notices of appeal.\n\n                When a defendant pleads guilty to a felony and the punishment assessed does not\n\nexceed that recommended by the prosecutor and agreed to by the defendant, the notice of appeal\n\nmust state that the appeal is for a jurisdictional defect, or that the substance of the appeal was raised\n\nby written motion and ruled on before trial, or that the trial court granted permission to appeal. Tex.\n\nR. App. P. 25.2(b)(3); see also Cooper v. State, 45 S.W.3d 77, 79 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (rule\n\n25.2(b) limits appeal in every felony plea bargain case). Appellant\u2019s notices of appeal do not comply\n\fwith this rule and fail to confer jurisdiction on this Court. Whitt v. State, 45 S.W.3d 274, 275 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Austin 2001, no pet.).\n\n               The appeals are dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                               Mack Kidd, Justice\n\nBefore Justices Kidd, Patterson and Puryear\n\nDismissed for Want of Jurisdiction\n\nFiled: April 4, 2002\n\nDo Not Publish\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f",
