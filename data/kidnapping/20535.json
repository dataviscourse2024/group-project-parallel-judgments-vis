Keasler, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which\r\nKeller, P.J., Meyers, and Womack, JJ., joined.\r\n\r\n\r\nO P I N I O N\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA jury found appellant guilty of aggravated kidnapping and assessed punishment at thirty-\r\nyears' incarceration.  Appellant appealed.  The court of appeals overruled his first issue on appeal,\r\nsustained his second issue-repayment of appointed attorney fees, modified the trial court's judgment,\r\nand affirmed it as modified. Mayer v. State, 274 S.W.3d 898, 902 (Tex. App.-Amarillo 2008).  We\r\nrefused appellant's petition for discretionary review, but granted review of the two grounds raised\r\nby the state prosecuting attorney's petition. (1)  \r\n\r\n\tAfter discharging the jury, the trial court announced the jury's verdict of guilt and assessment\r\nof punishment and informed appellant that he \"shall pay the Court costs in this case and the Court-appointed attorney's fees that are incurred by Swisher County, Texas in [his] defense.\"  In the written\r\njudgment, the trial court ordered appellant to reimburse the county for court-appointed-attorney fees\r\nin the amount of $2,850.\r\n\r\n\tOn appeal, appellant included claims complaining about the trial court ordering him to\r\nreimburse the county for court-appointed-attorney fees.  The court of appeals noted that, under article\r\n26.05(g), (2) \"the trial court has authority to order reimbursement of appointed attorney fees if the court\r\ndetermines that a defendant has financial resources that enable him to offset, in part or in whole, the\r\ncosts of the legal services provided.\" Mayer v. State, 274 S.W.3d at 901.  It also noted that the record\r\n\"does not contain any such determination or finding by the trial court that appellant had any financial\r\nresources or was 'able to pay' the appointed attorney fees.\" Id.  It also pointed to evidence in the\r\nrecord that \"demonstrate[d] that, before trial and within two months of the conclusion of the trial,\r\nappellant was indigent and qualified for court appointed counsel.\" Id.  It concluded that, in the\r\nabsence of \"evidence to demonstrate appellant's financial resources to offset the costs of the legal\r\nservices, the trial court erred in ordering reimbursement of appointed attorney fees.\" Id.   We affirm\r\nthe judgment of the court of appeals.\r\n\r\n\tThe state's first ground for review asserts that appellant procedurally defaulted the issue of\r\nattorney-fee reimbursement because he did not object in the trial court and that the court of appeals\r\nerred in reaching that issue for the first time on appeal.  It argues that appellant had an obligation to\r\n\"either make a trial objection on the record or complain in a motion for new trial concerning court-ordered reimbursement of attorney's fees[,]\" and that by failing to do so, he may not complain on\r\nappeal. (State's Brief, p. 3.)\r\n\r\n\tWe observe that appellant filed a pre-indictment \"Affidavit of Financial Status,\" which\r\nincluded a request for the court to appoint an attorney to represent him in this case because he did\r\nnot have the financial ability to hire his own attorney.  After review of the affidavit, the trial court\r\nfound that appellant was indigent and appointed an attorney to represent him at trial.\r\n\r\n\tThe state acknowledges that this affidavit reflects that appellant was unemployed and\r\nsupporting himself on government-sponsored benefits and that he was given a court-appointed trial\r\ncounsel.  The state also acknowledges that appellant \"filed a pro se notice of appeal and an affidavit\r\nof financial status in support of a request for appellate counsel, and that he was indeed given the\r\nassistance of appellate counsel.\" (State's Brief, p. 4.)  Nevertheless, the state notes that neither\r\nappellant nor his attorneys lodged any objection or complaint in the trial court to either the fact or\r\nthe amount of restitution for attorney's fees ordered reimbursed to the county nor made any such\r\nobjection in a motion for new trial.\r\n\r\n\tThe state argues that appellant's failure to object to the trial court's order to repay attorney\r\nfees is governed by our holding in Idowu v. State, 73 S.W.3d 918, 921 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002), that\r\nif a defendant wishes to complain about the propriety of, as opposed to the factual basis for, a trial\r\ncourt's restitution order, he must explicitly do so in the trial court.  The state also compares\r\nappellant's failure to object to a situation in which an appellant first challenges on appeal probation\r\nconditions that may be unreasonable, unconstitutional, or violative of statutory provisions.  It points\r\nto Speth v. State, 6 S.W.3d 530, 534 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), in which we held that \"[a] defendant\r\nwho benefits from the  contractual privilege of probation . . . must complain at trial to conditions he\r\nfinds objectionable.\"\r\n\r\n\tIn his response to the state's petition, appellant does not challenge the propriety of assessing\r\nattorney's fees, but argues here, as he did in the court of appeals, (3) that a challenge to the factual basis\r\nof a restitution order or an order to pay court-appointed-attorney fees is a challenge to the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence regarding that order, that before the court of appeals he claimed that the evidence to\r\nsupport the attorney-fee order was insufficient, and that the court of appeals correctly recognized it\r\nas insufficient (4).  He notes the well-settled principle \"that evidentiary sufficiency challenges do not\r\nrequire objection to be considered on appeal.\" (Appellant's Brief, p. 2.)\r\n\r\nThis Court has stated in the past that \"[a]n appellate court must always address\r\nchallenges to the [legal] sufficiency of the evidence.\" McFarland v. State, 930\r\nS.W.2d 99 at 100 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (citing Texas Rule of Appellate\r\nProcedure 90(a), now Rule 47.1, and Garza v. State, 715 S.W.2d 642 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1986)). A claim regarding sufficiency of the evidence need not be preserved\r\nfor review at the trial level and is not waived by the failure to do so. See Proctor\r\nv. State, 967 S.W.2d 840, 842 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998); Lemell v. State, 915\r\nS.W.2d 486, 490 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (citing McGlothlin v. State, 896 S.W.2d\r\n183, 190-91 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (Meyers, J., dissenting)); GEORGE E. DIX\r\nAND ROBERT O. DAWSON, 40 TEXAS PRACTICE, CRIMINAL PRACTICE\r\nAND PROCEDURE \u00a7 3.65 (2000 Supplement).\r\n\r\n\r\nRankin v. State, 46 S.W.3d 899, 901 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). (5)\r\n\r\n\tAppellant \"concedes that no objection was made to the requirement that he pay court-appointed attorney fees.\"  Appellant points to our language in Idowu, supra, \"We ordinarily allow\r\ndefendants to raise sufficiency of the evidence questions for the first time on appeal.  Whether the\r\nrecord provides a sufficient factual basis for a particular restitution order could be considered an\r\nevidentiary sufficiency question that need not be preserved by objection at the trial level.\" Idowu v.\r\nState, 73 S.W.3d at 922.  We also said that whether a party must object to preserve an evidentiary-\r\nsufficiency claim concerning a restitution order, or the amount of restitution, need not be resolved\r\nin Idowu. Id.  Two years later, we addressed that point, saying that \"a claim regarding sufficiency\r\nof the evidence need not be preserved for appellate review at the trial level, and it is not forfeited by\r\nthe failure to do so.\" Moff v. State, 131 S.W.3d 485, 489 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Appellant also\r\ncites opinions from courts of appeals for the proposition that no trial-court objection is required to\r\nraise an appellate complaint about court-appointed-attorney fees.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant also suggests that the Amarillo Court of Appeals properly understood his direct-appeal point of error to be one of insufficient evidence and deleted the attorney fees on that basis. \r\nHe points to the language in the court of appeals's opinion.\r\n\r\n\t[T]here is an absence of evidence to demonstrate that, at the conclusion of the trial,\r\nappellant was \"able to pay\" or had financial resources that would enable appellant to\r\noffset, in part or in whole, the costs of the legal services provided to him. . . . \r\nWithout evidence to demonstrate appellant's financial resources to offset the costs\r\nof the legal services, the trial court erred in ordering reimbursement of appointed\r\nattorney fees. [citations omitted.]  Accordingly, we modify the judgment to delete the\r\n[attorney fees].\r\n\r\n\r\nMayer v. State, 274 S.W.3d at 901.\r\n\r\n\tThe court of appeals properly analyzed appellant's point of error that complained about the\r\nlack of  record evidence of  \"sufficient inquiry\" into appellant's finances that would justify the trial\r\ncourt's determination that appellant should be ordered to pay court-appointed-attorney fees.  The\r\ncourt of appeals pointed out that appellant's reply brief, which was filed after the state had filed its\r\nresponse brief on direct appeal, conceded \"the sufficiency of the evidence\" of the amount of the\r\ncourt-ordered reimbursement of attorney fees after becoming aware of the itemized expense form\r\nthat had been submitted to the trial court after the conclusion of the trial and filed as a supplemental\r\nclerk's record after the filing of appellant's original brief.  Mayer, supra, at 900, n.1.  However,\r\nappellant also argued that the record was \"devoid of any evidence of how the fee was calculated and\r\nwhether his indigence prevented such a finding,\" thus including an assertion of evidentiary\r\ninsufficiency regarding the factual basis for finding that he had financial resources that would enable\r\nhim to reimburse the costs of the legal services provided. (Appellant's brief before the court of\r\nappeals, p. 8.)  \r\n\r\n\tAppellant also raised a point of error specifically questioning whether the record contained\r\n\"sufficient inquiry\" into his finances to allow him to be ordered to pay court-appointed-attorney fees. \r\nAppellant's reply brief to the state's response brief notes that, after reviewing his financial affidavit,\r\nthe trial court had initially found him to be indigent and qualified for appointed counsel, and\r\nappellant asserts that \"no evidence\" of a change of financial ability existed. (Appellant's reply brief\r\nbefore the court of appeals, p. 5.)  That reply also specifically argued that since \"no evidence\"\r\nshowed that appellant was able to pay appointed-attorney fees, the order requiring him to do so could\r\nnot stand. Id. at 6.\r\n\r\n\tThe court of appeals referred to the provisions of article 26.05(g) (6) as authorization for the\r\ntrial court to order the defendant to repay the costs of court-appointed legal counsel.  Specifically,\r\narticle 26.05(g) provides that, if the trial court determines that a defendant has the financial resources\r\nthat enable him to offset in whole or in part the costs of the legal services provided, the court shall\r\norder him to pay, as court costs, the amount that it finds the defendant is able to pay.  Thus the\r\ndefendant's financial resources and ability to pay are explicit critical elements in the trial court's\r\ndetermination of the propriety of ordering reimbursement of costs and fees. \r\n\r\n\tAppellant's claims before the court of appeals included assertions of insufficient evidence\r\nof his financial resources and ability to pay.  While this claim of evidentiary insufficiency differs\r\nsomewhat from a claim of insufficient evidence of guilt, we note that an objection at trial is not\r\nnecessary before making an appellate challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence concerning a\r\ndeadly weapon finding because \"[a] claim regarding sufficiency of the evidence need not be\r\npreserved for review at the trial level and is not waived by the failure to do so.\" Rankin v. State, 46\r\nS.W.3d 899, 901 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001).  We conclude that appellant's complaint about the\r\nsufficiency of evidence of his financial resources and ability to pay were likewise not waived by his\r\nfailure to raise such a complaint at trial.  We reiterate that no trial objection is required to preserve\r\nan appellate claim of insufficient evidence, thus the court of appeals did not err in addressing\r\nappellant's complaint about the order to reimburse court-appointed attorney fees.  Accordingly, we\r\noverrule ground one.\r\n\r\n\tThe state's second ground complains about the court of appeals deciding the indigent status\r\nof appellant as it existed at the time of trial without remanding the case to the trial court to give the\r\nstate an opportunity to be heard on the issue in the trial court and to give the trial court an\r\nopportunity to decide the issue.  It insists that neither it nor the trial court should be excluded from\r\nthe decision-making process of whether a defendant has the financial means to reimburse a county\r\nfor attorney's fees expended on the defendant's behalf.  It further complains that the court of\r\nappeals's decision was made before the state had an opportunity to test appellant's financial status\r\n\"in the crucible of the adversarial process.\" (State's Brief, p. 3.)\r\n\r\n\tThe state acknowledges that this case \"is not about whether Appellant is indigent and\r\ntherefore too poor to hire a lawyer or too poor to reimburse Swisher County for attorney's fees\r\nalready expended by the County.\" (State's Brief, p. 3.)  The state  is not contending that appellant\r\nwas not indigent, but takes issue with the court of appeals making a presumption of indigence when\r\nthe trial court is the proper forum for such a finding.  (State's Brief, p. 6.)  \r\n\r\n\tThe state contends that a remand order to the trial court would be appropriate so that the trial\r\ncourt could hear evidence and make the decision whether, and what amount of money, appellant\r\nshould reimburse the county for attorney fees, and so the state has an opportunity, if it so desires, to\r\ncontest whatever evidence or arguments appellant employs against the trial court's order, and to\r\npresent evidence and arguments in support of its own position.  It analogizes such a remand to cases\r\nin which the amount of restitution ordered as a lawful condition of community supervision is not\r\nsupported by the record and remanding for the purposes of a restitution hearing is appropriate.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant argues that the court of appeals, in finding that the evidence to support the order\r\nto repay attorney fees was absent, ruled that the evidence was legally insufficient to justify the order. \r\nHe also asserts that the state's brief points to no facts in the record indicating that he could pay those\r\nfees and was not necessarily contending that he was not indigent.  Appellant also suggests that a\r\nremand would be pointless because the trial court appointed counsel at trial and, after appellant's\r\nconviction, appointed another attorney to represent him on appeal.  He asserts that the trial court has\r\nthus already twice decided that appellant is indigent and without the financial ability to pay and,\r\nsince he was sentenced to thirty-years' incarceration-a term that bars release on bail-the trial court\r\nhas already \"judged that [he] could not have had measurably more financial ability to pay at the time\r\nof trial than immediately after indictment.\" (Appellant's Brief, p. 9.)  We also observe that article\r\n26.04(p), provides that \"[a] defendant who is determined by the court to be indigent is presumed to\r\nremain indigent for the remainder of the proceedings in the case unless a material change in the\r\ndefendant's financial circumstances occurs.\"\r\n\r\n\tWhen claims of insufficient evidence are made, the cases are not usually remanded to permit\r\nsupplementation of the record to make up for alleged deficiencies in the record evidence. \r\nSufficiency of the evidence is measured by viewing all of the record evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the verdict.  In this case, there is no indication that the state was precluded from\r\npresenting evidence and being heard on the issue of appellant's financial resources and ability to pay\r\nfor reimbursement of the court-appointed-attorney fees.  We are unconvinced that the court of\r\nappeals committed any error in determining that the trial court erred in ordering reimbursement of\r\nattorney fees without remanding the case to the trial court.  We therefore overrule ground two.\r\n\r\n\tThe judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelivered: March 24, 2010\r\n\r\nPublish\r\n1.   1.  \"The Court of Appeals erred in reaching the attorney fee reimbursement issue for the first time on\r\nappeal, when no objection whatsoever was made by appellant at the trial court level, resulting in a procedural\r\ndefault.\r\n\r\n\t   \" 2. The Court of Appeals erred in deciding the indigent status of appellant as it existed at the time of trial\r\nwithout remanding the case to the trial court to give the State an opportunity to be heard on this issue in the trial\r\ncourt, and to give the trial court an opportunity to decide the issue.  The Court below has decided an important\r\nquestion of law that has not been, but should be settled by this Court.\"\r\n2.    Tex. Code Crim. Proc., art. 26.05(g)\r\n3.    \"Appellant now appeals . . . the sufficiency of the court order for the reimbursement of the court\r\nappointed attorney fees.\"  Mayer v. State, 274 S.W.3d at 899-900. \r\n4.   \"Under article 26.05(g) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court has authority to order\r\nreimbursement of appointed attorney fees if the court determines that a defendant has financial resources that enable\r\nhim to offset, in part or in whole, the costs of the legal services provided. . . . Without evidence to demonstrate\r\nappellant's financial resources to offset the costs of the legal services, the trial court erred in ordering reimbursement\r\nof appointed attorney fees.\"  Id. at 901. \r\n5.    We presume that the court of appeals knows that preservation is a systemic requirement and that it is\r\nobligated to consider whether the errors complained of were forfeited because of failure to preserve the error.  The\r\ncourt of appeals decided this case on the merits of the insufficiency claim, and so we presume that it impliedly found\r\nthat appellant's ground raised legal insufficiency and such a claim may be raised for the first time on appeal.\r\n6.
