In appeals\n                    from postconviction proceedings, an appellate court reviews de novo a\n                    determination that the defendant failed to allege sufficient facts to dem-\n                    onstrate a violation of his or her constitutional rights or that the record\n                    and files affirmatively show that the defendant is entitled to no relief.\n                 2.

The motion relies on the U.S. Supreme\n               Court\u2019s decision in Hurst v. Florida 1 and alleges Hessler\u2019s\n               death sentence is invalid because Nebraska\u2019s capital sentenc-\n               ing statutes violate Hessler\u2019s rights under the 6th, 8th, and\n                1\n                    Hurst v.

HESSLER\n                             Cite as 305 Neb. 451\n\n14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. We addressed an\nidentical argument in State v. Lotter 2 and held Hurst was not\na proper triggering event for the 1-year limitations period of\nthe Nebraska Postconviction Act. 3 Citing Lotter, the district\ncourt found Hessler\u2019s motion was time barred and denied it\nwithout conducting an evidentiary hearing. Hessler appeals,\nand we affirm.\n                              FACTS\n   In 2004, Hessler was convicted by a jury of first degree\nmurder, kidnapping, first degree sexual assault, and use of a\nfirearm to commit a felony. He was sentenced to death on the\nmurder conviction. He unsuccessfully challenged his convic-\ntions and sentences on direct appeal 4 and in two prior postcon-\nviction proceedings. 5\n   On January 12, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court decided\nHurst. 6 Hurst found that Florida\u2019s capital sentencing scheme\nwas unconstitutional, because it required the trial court alone\nto find both that sufficient aggravating circumstances existed\nto justify imposition of the death penalty and that there were\ninsufficient mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggra-\nvating circumstances. Roughly 10 months after Hurst was\ndecided, Hessler filed this successive motion for postconvic-\ntion relief. The motion asserts:\n      Jurisdiction is proper in this Court as the decision in\n      Hurst v. Florida . . . was issued by the United States\n      Supreme Court on January 12, 2016 and . . . Hessler is\n      asserting that Hurst is applicable in his case and therefore\n      has one year from the date of that decision to file this\n      motion pursuant to . . . \u00a7 29-3001 . . . .\n2\n    State v.

HESSLER\n                            Cite as 305 Neb. 451\n\n   Hessler\u2019s motion relies on Hurst and alleges that Nebraska\u2019s\ncapital sentencing statutes 7 violate the 6th, 8th, and 14th\nAmendments. It specifically alleges the Sixth amendment\nis violated because the Nebraska statutes allow a panel of\njudges, and not a jury, to \u201cmake factual findings in imposing a\ndeath sentence.\u201d The motion further alleges \u201cto the extent that\nNebraska\u2019s death-penalty statutes do not require a unanimous\nrecommendation from a jury regarding whether a sentence of\ndeath should be imposed, [the statutes] violate[] the 8th and 14th\nAmendments.\u201d\n   Identical 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendment claims based on\nHurst were raised in a successive motion for postconvic-\ntion relief in Lotter, 8 and we rejected them in an opinion\nreleased September 28, 2018. We reasoned that the Nebraska\nPostconviction Act contains a 1-year limitations period for fil-\ning a verified motion for postconviction relief, which runs from\none of four triggering events or from August 27, 2011, which-\never is later. 9 The triggering events under \u00a7 29-3001(4) are:\n         (a) The date the judgment of conviction became final\n      by the conclusion of a direct appeal or the expiration of\n      the time for filing a direct appeal;\n         (b) The date on which the factual predicate of the\n      constitutional claim or claims alleged could have been\n      discovered through the exercise of due diligence;\n         (c) The date on which an impediment created by state\n      action, in violation of the Constitution of the United\n      States or the Constitution of Nebraska or any law of this\n      state, is removed, if the prisoner was prevented from fil-\n      ing a verified motion by such state action;\n         (d) The date on which a constitutional claim asserted\n      was initially recognized by the Supreme Court of the\n      United States or the Nebraska Supreme Court, if the\n7\n    See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 29-2521 to 29-2522 (Cum. Supp. 2018).\n8\n    Lotter, supra note 2.\n9\n    \u00a7 29-3001(4).\n\f                                     - 454 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      305 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE v. HESSLER\n                              Cite as 305 Neb. 451\n\n      newly recognized right has been made applicable retroac-\n      tively to cases on postconviction collateral review[.]\nLike Hessler\u2019s postconviction claims, the claims alleged in\nLotter regarding the 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendments were all\nbased on Hurst, and the defendant in Lotter relied on the trig-\ngering event in \u00a7 29-3001(4)(d) to contend the claims were\ntimely. We rejected this contention.\n   We held in Lotter that Hurst could not trigger the 1-year\nstatute of limitations under \u00a7 29-3001(4)(d), because Hurst did\nnot announce a new rule of law and merely applied the con-\nstitutional rule from the 2002 case of Ring v. Arizona. 10 Lotter\nalso held that the \u201cplain language of Hurst reveals no hold-\ning that a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the\naggravating factors outweigh the mitigating circumstances.\u201d 11\nFinally, Lotter reasoned that even if Hurst announced a new\nrule of law, it would not apply retroactively to cases on col-\nlateral review, because it was based on Ring and the U.S.\nSupreme Court has held that Ring announced a procedural rule\nthat does not apply retroactively. 12 Having concluded in Lotter\nthat Hurst did not announce a new rule of law, we rejected\nthe defendant\u2019s contention that Hurst could trigger the 1-year\nstatute of limitations under \u00a7 29-3001(4)(d), and we found\nthe defendant\u2019s postconviction claims were time barred. 13 The\ndefendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the\nU.S. Supreme Court on June 17, 2019. 14\n   Citing to our analysis and holding in Lotter, the district\ncourt here found that Hessler\u2019s motion was time barred, and it\ndismissed the motion without an evidentiary hearing. Hessler\ntimely appealed.\n10\n     Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002).\n11\n     Lotter, supra note 2, 301 Neb. at 144, 917 N.W.2d at 864.\n12\n     Schriro v.

Hessler further conceded there was no factual distinc-\ntion between his postconviction claims and those asserted in\nLotter, and he pointed to no change in the relevant law since\nour decision in Lotter.\n   Our decision in Lotter is dispositive of the issues presented\nin this appeal, and Hessler does not contend otherwise. Hurst\ndid not announce a new rule of law, and thus it cannot trigger\nthe 1-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 29-3001(4)(d). Because\nthis is the only triggering event relied upon by Hessler in con-\ntending that his postconviction claims are timely, we agree\nwith the district court that Hessler\u2019s postconviction claims are\ntime barred.\n   For the sake of completeness, we note that even if Hessler\u2019s\nclaims were not time barred, they would not entitle him to\n15\n     Mata, supra note 13.\n16\n     Id.\n\f                                  - 456 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      305 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v.

Arizona. 17 McKinney\nexplained:\n         Under Ring and Hurst, a jury must find the aggravat-\n      ing circumstance that makes the defendant death eligible.\n      But importantly, in a capital sentencing proceeding just as\n      in an ordinary sentencing proceeding, a jury (as opposed\n      to a judge) is not constitutionally required to weigh the\n      aggravating and mitigating circumstances or to make the\n      ultimate sentencing decision within the relevant sentenc-\n      ing range. 18\nAs such, McKinney makes clear there is no merit to the under-\nlying premise of Hessler\u2019s postconviction claims.\n   We thus affirm the district court\u2019s order denying postconvic-\ntion relief without an evidentiary hearing.\n                                                    Affirmed.\n   Freudenberg, J., not participating.\n17\n     McKinney v.
