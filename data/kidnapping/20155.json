DICKSON\tAPPELLANT\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS\tSTATE\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\nFROM THE 371ST DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\nOPINION\n\n\n\n------------\n\nJoe W. Dickson appeals his convictions for aggravated sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping. \u00a0In nine points, he challenges the factual sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, asserts unanimity and double jeopardy violations, and argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for the State to make an election. \u00a0We affirm.\n\nBackground\n\nA grand jury indicted Appellant for the aggravated sexual assault of complainant Ora \u00a0W. and the aggravated kidnapping of complainant \u00a0\u201cAdam\u201d (a pseudonym) on or about October 4, 2006. \u00a0Appellant pleaded not guilty, and the cases were tried to a jury.\n\nOra testified that in October 2006, she shared a home with her four-year-old nephew, Adam; her two daughters, Beatrice and Carol (both pseudonyms); and Appellant, who had been her boyfriend until a few months earlier. \u00a0She said that on the morning of October 4, Appellant punched her in the stomach with his fist\u2014causing bruises that were visible in photographs taken a couple of days later and admitted into evidence at trial\u2014and she fell to the ground screaming. Appellant bound her wrists with plastic zip ties and dragged her to the bedroom. \u00a0According to Ora, when Adam followed them to the bedroom, Appellant pushed him into the closet and said, \u201cStay in the closet because I don\u2019t want you to see me kill your aunt.\u201d \u00a0Ora testified that Appellant then tore her underwear off, laid a shotgun on the bed, threatened her with a knife or box cutter, and attempted to penetrate her anus with his penis. \u00a0When his attempt failed, Appellant forced her to perform oral sex on him until he ejaculated in her mouth, all while holding the box cutter to her throat. \n\nOra testified that Appellant then told her to \u201cstart praying to God to save \u00a0[her] life soul.\u201d \u00a0Appellant gagged Ora with a shirt and tape, tied her legs with an electrical cord, and told her that if her sister came to the door, he would \u201cblow her head off.\u201d \u00a0After about three hours, Appellant released Ora and told her to take a bath, and she showered while Appellant stood in the bathroom doorway. \u00a0Ora testified that Appellant told her he was sorry but that he would kill her if she told anyone what he had done. \u00a0She said that despite his threat, she went to her sister Brenda Jackson\u2019s house next door while Appellant remained at home, and Ora told Brenda and Brenda\u2019s daughter, Sametra Jackson, what Appellant had done. \n\nOra and Appellant then went to pick up Beatrice and Carol at school. \u00a0Ora said that upon their return, she, Appellant, Adam, and Beatrice sat in the garage, which was furnished with a couch. \u00a0While they were sitting there, a friend of Ora\u2019s named Tonya Gilstrap drove up, jumped out of her car, and said, \u201cYou mean this mother-f***** still here after what he done to you?\u201d \u00a0Ora did not see a gun in Tonya\u2019s hands. \u00a0Ora said that she walked toward Tonya while saying that Appellant had not done anything to her because she was afraid Tonya would start a fight with Appellant. \u00a0Ora then walked into Brenda\u2019s house to get away from Appellant while Brenda called for Adam and Beatrice to go to her house, too. \u00a0She testified that Beatrice grabbed Adam but that Appellant pulled Adam away from her and carried him into Ora and Appellant\u2019s house. \n\nOra said that she then saw Appellant raise his shotgun and start shooting, so she climbed out of a window in Brenda\u2019s house, jumped a neighbor\u2019s (\u201cCuttie\u2019s\u201d) fence, and sought refuge in Cuttie\u2019s garage. \u00a0She heard \u201cquite a few\u201d more gun shots. \u00a0Eventually, police arrived and evacuated everyone from the area. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOra\u2019s niece Sametra Jackson testified that she; her boyfriend, Rudy Johnson; and her mother, Brenda Jackson, were all in Brenda\u2019s house on the day of the incident when Ora came to the house around noon. \u00a0Ora was jittery and upset. \u00a0Ora talked to Sametra and the others for fifteen minutes and then returned to her own house. \u00a0Sametra said she was concerned and afraid for Ora. \u00a0According to Sametra, after Ora left, Brenda made a telephone call to someone. \u00a0A short while later, Sametra saw Tonya drive up, get out of her car, and walk up to Ora\u2019s house. \u00a0She did not see a gun in Tonya\u2019s hand. \u00a0When Sametra and Brenda called to the children to get away from Ora\u2019s house; Beatrice ran off down the street, and Sametra chased after her. \u00a0Sametra said she then heard a gunshot and ran into Cuttie\u2019s house. \u00a0She heard more gun shots but did not see who was shooting and did not see anyone get hit by gunfire. \u00a0She later saw gunshot wounds on Cuttie, Tonya, and Rudy. \u00a0She said Rudy lost his right eye and two teeth and still has buckshot embedded in his chest. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBrenda Jackson testified that after Ora told her and Sametra what Appellant had done to her, she called Tonya Gilstrap and told her what Ora had said. \u00a0Tonya drove up five or ten minutes later, got out of her car, and spoke to Appellant, who was sitting in his garage with the garage door open. \u00a0She did not see a gun in Tonya\u2019s hands. \u00a0Brenda testified that she yelled to Appellant, \u201cYou wrong for what you did,\u201d and called Adam and Beatrice to come to her because she was concerned about what Appellant might do when he found out Brenda and Tonya knew what he had done to Ora. \u00a0She said that Beatrice came out of the garage, and Appellant grabbed Adam and took him inside the house. Brenda ran into her own house. \u00a0She then heard several gunshots. \u00a0Brenda testified that Rudy was hit with gunfire and that Tonya, after helping to move Rudy into Brenda\u2019s house, went back outside and got shot, too. \u00a0Brenda called 911; after listening to the 911 tape, she testified that she called 911 before the shooting started. \u00a0Police eventually evacuated her and the other people in her house. \u00a0She did not see Adam again until around 7:00 a.m. the following day. \n\nRudy Johnson testified that when Tonya drove up, she jumped out of her car and screamed at Appellant. \u00a0Rudy did not see anything in Tonya\u2019s hands. Rudy told Tonya to calm down and told Adam and Beatrice to come out of the garage. \u00a0Beatrice ran down the street, and Appellant grabbed Adam. \u00a0Rudy testified that he and Tonya tried to rescue Adam from Appellant, but Appellant ran inside the house with Adam and closed the door. \u00a0Rudy saw a cell phone on the floor of Appellant\u2019s garage, picked it up, and called the police as he walked out of the garage. \u00a0He heard a gunshot fired from a window of Appellant\u2019s house and, as he walked toward Brenda\u2019s house, a second shot hit him in the face. \u00a0Rudy took shelter in Brenda\u2019s house until the police came and evacuated him from the area. \n\nKevin \u201cCuttie\u201d Willis testified that he lived in the house next door to Brenda\u2019s; Appellant and Ora lived in the house on the other side of Brenda\u2019s. He was sitting in his garage when he saw Tonya drive up, get out of her car, and start \u201ccussing\u201d Appellant, who was in his garage with Ora and some children. \u00a0He testified that Tonya had a pistol in her hand. \u00a0He saw Ora come out of the garage and say, \u201cGirl, what [are] you talking about?\u201d \u00a0Appellant grabbed Adam, and then Tonya and Rudy ran up into Appellant\u2019s garage. \u00a0Cuttie did not see Tonya point her pistol or fire it. \u00a0Tonya and Rudy came back out of Appellant\u2019s garage, and Cuttie saw Rudy get shot. \u00a0Cuttie said he went into his house to get his own gun, returned to his garage, and fired two shots in the air towards Appellant\u2019s house to give the children in the area time to take cover. \u00a0He saw Tonya come out of Brenda\u2019s house and cross the yard to his house; then he and Tonya were both shot. \u00a0Cuttie said his friend Ernest Cary, who was also in Cuttie\u2019s garage, then grabbed Cuttie\u2019s gun and fired additional shots at Appellant\u2019s house. \u00a0Police later evacuated Cuttie through the back of his property. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nForest Hill Police Detective Demond Spraberry testified that he was dispatched to the scene of the incident. \u00a0He said that the Everman Police Department, the Tarrant County Constable\u2019s Office, the Fort Worth Police Department and SWAT team, the Burleson SWAT team, and the Mansfield SWAT team all assisted with the incident because the Forest Hill Police Department was not equipped to deal with a hostage situation. \u00a0Detective Spraberry and other officers set up a security perimeter around the area and evacuated area homes by taking the residents into a field behind the houses. Detective Spraberry helped evacuate Brenda\u2019s house, and he said four people in the house were injured: Rudy, Tonya, and Cuttie\u2014all of whom had gunshot wounds\u2014and Ora, who had bruises on her stomach, wrists, and ankles. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nMansfield SWAT officer Timothy Wing testified that he and his SWAT team arrived on the scene around 11:20 p.m. \u00a0He said that around sunup on the following day, Appellant walked out of his house under a negotiated \u201csurrender plan\u201d, and the SWAT team arrested him. \u00a0Officer Wing then entered the house with other members of his team and searched the house until they found Adam, who was scared but unharmed. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nForest Hill crime scene officer Richard Kyle arrived at the scene after Appellant surrendered and the crime scene was secure. \u00a0During his search of Appellant\u2019s house, he found evidence of several shotgun shots fired from inside the house, a shotgun, severed electrical cords, and a pair of torn panties, which Ora identified as the ones she was wearing at the time of the assault. \n\nMansfield Police Officer Daniel Sherwin testified that he negotiated with Appellant via a telephone the SWAT team tossed into Appellant\u2019s house through a window. \u00a0Appellant told him, \u201cThe boy is not coming out.\u201d \u00a0Officer Sherwin eventually developed a surrender plan with Appellant, and Appellant surrendered. \u00a0\n\nAppellant called Ernest Cary as a witness. \u00a0Cary testified that he saw a woman drive up and get out of her car with a pistol in her hand. \u00a0He said that he saw the lady and Rudy run into Appellant\u2019s garage and chase Appellant into his house. \u00a0Cary saw Appellant grab Adam and said he thought Appellant did so to protect himself from Tonya, though he later testified that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not like he was holding the baby up . . . so if she shot, the baby would be the first one to get hit. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t [anything] like that.\u201d \u00a0He said Appellant fired the first shot, and he never saw Tonya point or fire her pistol. \u00a0Cary testified that he fired Cuttie\u2019s gun \u201c[s]o that [Appellant would] quit shooting [and they could] get the kids, because there\u2019s like kids everywhere.\u201d \u00a0\n\nThe jury convicted Appellant of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault. \u00a0After hearing punishment-phase testimony, the jury assessed punishment at seventeen years\u2019 confinement on the aggravated kidnapping conviction and eleven years\u2019 confinement on the aggravated sexual assault conviction, and the trial court sentenced Appellant accordingly. \n\nDiscussion\n\n1.\tFactual Sufficiency\n\nIn his first three points, Appellant challenges the factual sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions.\n\nWhen reviewing the factual sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view all the evidence in a neutral light, favoring neither party. \u00a0\nNeal v. State, \n256 S.W.3d 264, 275 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)\n;\n Watson v. State\n, 204 S.W.3d 404, 414 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). \u00a0We then ask whether the evidence supporting the conviction, although legally sufficient, is nevertheless so weak that the factfinder\u2019s determination is clearly wrong and manifestly unjust or whether conflicting evidence so greatly outweighs the evidence supporting the conviction that the factfinder\u2019s determination is manifestly unjust. \u00a0\nLancon v. State\n, 253 S.W.3d 699, 704 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); \nWatson\n, 204 S.W.3d at 414\u201315, 417\n. \u00a0To reverse under the second ground, we must determine, with some objective basis in the record, that the great weight and preponderance of all the evidence, though legally sufficient, contradicts the verdict. \u00a0\nWatson\n, 204 S.W.3d at 417.\n\na.\tSexual Assault\n\nIn his second point, Appellant argues that the evidence is factually insufficient to support his aggravated sexual assault conviction because Ora\u2019s testimony regarding the assault was uncorroborated; her testimony \u201cis self-contradictory on multiple occasions\u201d; and her testimony about her actions following the assault\u2014going to Brenda\u2019s house, returning to Appellant\u2019s house, and accompanying Appellant to pick up the children at school\u2014is \u201cincredible.\u201d \n\nThe lack of physical or forensic evidence is merely a factor for the jury to consider in weighing the evidence. \nSee Lee v. State\n, 176 S.W.3d 452, 458 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2004), \naff\u2019d\n, 206 S.W.3d 620 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). \u00a0It is not needed to corroborate the complainant\u2019s testimony. \u00a0\nSee\n Tex. Code \u00a0Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.07 (Vernon 2005); \nsee also Glockzin v. State\n, 220 S.W.3d 140, 148 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2007, pet. ref\u2019d) (holding that when victim testified to facts establishing aggravated sexual assault, lack of physical or forensic evidence did not demonstrate factual insufficiency). \u00a0Further, the physical evidence in this case\u2014the bruises on Ora\u2019s abdomen, wrists, and ankles and the torn panties and severed electrical cords found in her bedroom\u2014did corroborate Ora\u2019s account of the assault.\n\nConcerning the alleged inconsistencies in Ora\u2019s testimony, a jury is free to believe or disbelieve the testimony of any witness and to reconcile conflicts in the testimony. \u00a0\nBottenfield v. State\n, 77 S.W.3d 349, 355 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2002, pet. ref\u2019d), \ncert. denied\n, 539 U.S. 916 (2003). \u00a0A jury confronted with conflicting evidence may elect to believe one witness and disbelieve others and may resolve inconsistencies in the testimony of any witness. \nCain v. State\n, 958 S.W.2d 404, 408\u201309 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). \u00a0In this case, the jury resolved any inconsistencies in Ora\u2019s testimony against Appellant, and it was free to do so. \u00a0\nSee id.\n \u00a0And to the extent that the jury determined that Ora\u2019s actions following the assault were not \u201cincredible,\u201d as Appellant contends, we cannot say that their determination was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. \u00a0We therefore overrule Appellant\u2019s second point.\n\nb.\tKidnapping\n\nIn his first point, Appellant argues that the evidence is factually insufficient to support his conviction for aggravated kidnapping because he did not sexually assault Adam, the evidence shows that he did not use Adam as a shield but instead attempted to protect him from the gun-wielding Tonya, and he did not \u201csecrete\u201d Adam because everyone knew Adam was in Appellant\u2019s home. \n\nA person commits the offense of aggravated kidnapping if he intentionally or knowingly abducts another person with the intent to use him as a shield or hostage or facilitate the commission of a felony or the flight after the commission of a felony. \u00a0Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 20.04 (Vernon 2003). \u00a0\u201cAbduct\u201d means to restrain a person with intent to prevent his liberation by secreting or holding him in a place where he is not likely to be found or using or threatening to use deadly force. \u00a0\nId.\n \u00a7 20.01(2) (Vernon Supp. 2008). \u00a0\u201cRestrain\u201d means to restrict a person\u2019s movement without consent, and restraint is \u201cwithout consent\u201d when accomplished by any means if the victim is a child under fourteen years of age and the parent or guardian has not acquiesced in the confinement. \u00a0\nId.\n \u00a7 20.01(1).\n\nThe indictment alleged that Appellant\n\nwith the intent to use [Adam] as a shield or hostage or facilitate the commission of a felony, to wit: aggravated sexual assault, or to facilitate the flight after the attempt or commission of said felony, intentionally or knowingly abduct[ed] [Adam] by restraining [him] without consent by moving [him] from one place to another or confining [him] with the intent to prevent [Adam\u2019s] liberation . . . by using or threatening to use deadly force, namely by shooting a firearm at Rudy Johnson who was trying to rescue [Adam] or by shooting a firearm at Tonya Gilstrap who was trying to rescue [Adam] or by firing a firearm out the window of his home. \n\n\n\nThe court\u2019s charge tracked the indictment. \n\nThe evidence presented at trial showed that when Tonya confronted Appellant over his sexually assaulting Ora, he grabbed Adam, retreated into his house, and opened fire on Tonya and Rudy with a shotgun. \u00a0The jury could reasonably believe that Appellant restrained Adam\u2019s liberty by using deadly force with the intent to facilitate his flight after having sexually assaulted Ora. \u00a0Alternatively\u2014if the jury believed that Tonya was holding a pistol when she confronted Appellant\u2014the jury could reasonably conclude that Appellant restrained \u00a0Adam\u2019s liberty by using deadly force with the intent to use Adam as a shield or hostage. \u00a0The jury could reasonably reach the same conclusion based on the evidence that after shooting Rudy, Tonya, and Cuttie, Appellant barricaded himself in his house for hours and refused to release Adam.\n\nThus, the State was not required to prove that Appellant intended to or did sexually assault Adam. \u00a0Nor was the State required to prove that Appellant secreted Adam; the indictment alleged both alternative definitions of \u201cabduct\u201d\u2014secreting or using or threatening to use deadly force\u2014and there was ample evidence that Appellant used deadly force when he fired a shotgun at Rudy, Tonya, and Cuttie. \u00a0\n\nWe cannot say that the \nevidence supporting the conviction is so weak that the jury\u2019s verdict is clearly wrong and manifestly unjust or that the \u00a0conflicting evidence so greatly outweighs the evidence supporting the conviction that the jury\u2019s verdict is manifestly unjust. \u00a0\nSee Lancon\n, 253 S.W.3d at 704; \nWatson\n, 204 S.W.3d at 414\u201315, 417\n. \u00a0We therefore hold that the evidence is factually sufficient to support Appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated kidnapping, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s first point.\n\nc.\tWhether Appellant voluntarily released Adam in a safe place\n\nIn his third issue, Appellant argues that the greater weight and preponderance of the credible evidence shows that he voluntarily released Adam in a safe place. \u00a0At the punishment stage of trial, a defendant convicted of aggravated kidnapping may raise the issue as to whether he voluntarily released the victim in a safe place. \u00a0Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 20.04(d). \u00a0If the defendant proves the issue by a preponderance of the evidence, the offense is a felony of the second degree, rather than the first degree. \u00a0\nId\n.\n \u00a0\nThe burden to demonstrate the safe release lies with the defendant under section 20.04(d). \nTeer v. State\n, 923 S.W.2d 11, 15 n.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). \n\nWhen evaluating the factual sufficiency of the evidence offered to support the denial of an affirmative defense, or any fact issue where the law has shifted to the defendant the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, the correct standard of review is whether after considering all of the evidence relevant to the issue, \u201cthe judgment is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust.\u201d \u00a0\nGallo v. State\n, 239 S.W.3d 757, 770 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (quoting \u00a0\nMeraz v. State\n, 785 S.W.2d 146, 155 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)), \ncert. denied\n, 128 S. Ct. 2872 (2008). \u00a0\n\nAppellant requested a punishment-phase jury instruction on voluntary release, which the trial court denied, citing \nBrown v. State\n, 98 S.W.3d 180 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). \u00a0That denial forms the basis of Appellant\u2019s fourth point. \u00a0\u00a0Upon timely request, an accused is entitled to an affirmative defense\n\ninstruction on every issue raised by the evidence, whether it is strong, feeble,\n\nunimpeached, or contradicted, and even if the trial court is of the opinion that\n\nit is not entitled to belief. \n Warren v. State\n, 565 S.W.2d 931, 933\u201334 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1978).\n\nIn \nBrown\n, the court of criminal appeals extensively analyzed the meaning of \u201cvoluntarily\u201d under section 20.04(d). \u00a098 S.W.3d\n 183\u201388\n. \u00a0The court rejected a broad interpretation of \u201cvoluntarily\u201d in favor of a narrow interpretation, \u201csuch as the absence \u2018of rescue by the police [or others] or escape by the [kidnap] victim.\u2019\u201c \n Id.\n at 188 (quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 212.1 cmt. at 233\u201334) (providing requirement that release be \u201cvoluntary\u201d means that \u201crescue by the police or escape by the victim\u201d will not reduce the punishment level of the offense). \u00a0\u201cThe cases determining when a kidnapper voluntarily releases the victim in a safe place require the kidnapper to release the victim without any element of rescue or escape.\u201d \u00a0\nCooks v. State\n, 169 S.W.3d 288, 291 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2005, pet. ref\u2019d). \u00a0When a victim is released or abandoned as a result of police intervention or confrontation, the defendant\u2019s conduct likely will not rise to the level of \u201cvoluntary release\u201d under section 20.04(d). \u00a0\nSee Ballard v. State\n, 193 S.W.3d 916, 919 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (holding appellant\u2019s leaving victim in car with keys did not voluntarily release victim; victim did not escape until police intervened); \nLaHood v. State\n, 171 S.W.3d 613, 624\u201325 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. ref\u2019d) (holding defendant not entitled to safe-release instruction when he released victim only after police stopped his vehicle); \nFowler v.

App. 1999) (holding defendant did not voluntarily release victim when he surrendered after forty-five-minute standoff with police, leaving victim unharmed in motel room); \u00a0\nOestrick v.

App.\u2014Austin 1997, pet. ref\u2019d) (holding defendant\u2019s abandoning victim in his truck in an attempt to escape after being surrounded by police was not voluntary release). \u00a0Such circumstances are more analogous to a rescue or escape and will prohibit a finding of voluntary release. \u00a0\nSee Brown\n, 98 S.W.3d at 188.\n\nIn this case, Appellant contends that there was some evidence that he voluntarily released Adam. \u00a0The record does not support his contention. \u00a0The undisputed evidence shows that Appellant refused to release Adam even when confronted by the police departments and SWAT teams of several municipalities. \u00a0Appellant continued to hold Adam until hours of negotiation resulted in Appellant\u2019s surrender. \u00a0To say that Appellant voluntarily released Adam would require the broadest possible interpretation of \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\u2014an interpretation the court of criminal appeals specifically rejected in \nBrown\n. \u00a0\nSee id.\n\nWe hold that there is no evidence that Appellant voluntarily released Adam. \u00a0Therefore, the trial court did not err by refusing to give the jury a section 20.04(d) instruction. \u00a0\nSee Warren\n, 565 S.W.2d at 933\u201334. \u00a0\n And absent any evidence of voluntary release, the judgment is not so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. \u00a0\nSee Gallo, \n239 S.W.3d at 770. \u00a0We therefore overrule Appellant\u2019s third and fourth points.\n\n2.\tJury Unanimity\n\nIn his fifth and sixth points, Appellant argues that he was \u201cdenied double jeopardy protection . . . in that he was denied a unanimous verdict\u201d in both cases. \u00a0Appellant mentions double jeopardy only in the headings for these two issues; his argument focuses solely on jury unanimity and does not explain how he was \u201cdenied double jeopardy protection.\u201d \u00a0Therefore, we will analyze his fifth and sixth issues as raising unanimity and not double jeopardy.\n\nJury unanimity is required in all criminal cases. \u00a0\nNgo v. State\n, 175 S.W.3d 738, 745 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). \u00a0The jury must agree that the defendant committed one specific crime. \u00a0\nLandrian v. State\n, 268 S.W.3d 532, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). \u00a0That does not mean, however, that the jury must unanimously find that the defendant committed that crime in one specific way or even with one specific act. \u00a0\nId. \u00a0\nThe unanimity requirement is not violated when the jury is instructed on alternative theories, or manner and means, of committing the same offense. \u00a0\nDe Los Santos v. State\n, 219 S.W.3d 71, 76 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2006, no pet.); \nCook v. State\n, 192 S.W.3d 115, 118 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.). \u00a0Texas courts have long held that the State may plead alternate \u201cmanner and means\u201d of the commission of the same offense. \u00a0\nSee Willis v. State\n, 34 Tex. Crim. 148, 149, 29 S.W. 787, 788 (1895). \u00a0An indictment may contain as many paragraphs as are necessary to allege the various manner and means of committing one alleged offense. \u00a0\nCallins v. State\n, 780 S.W.2d 176, 182\u201483 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986), \ncert. denied\n, 497 U.S. 1011 (1990). \u00a0If the statute in question establishes different manner and means by which the offense may be committed, unanimity is generally not required on the alternate manner and means of the offense\u2019s commission. \u00a0\nJefferson v. State\n, 189 S.W.3d 305, 312 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). \n\nAppellant argues that \u201cthe jury was required to find at least 1 of the following 4 scenarios in order to convict\u201d him of aggravated kidnapping and sets out a page-long list of the different possible \u201cscenarios\u201d the jury could find based on the disjunctive \u201cmanner and means\u201d allegations set out in the indictment and repeated in the jury charge. \u00a0In \nGonzales v. State\n, the Amarillo Court of Appeals rejected a similar argument. \u00a0270 S.W.3d 282, 288\u201389 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo \n2008, pet. ref\u2019d). \u00a0The \nGonzales \ncourt held that although an indictment for aggravated kidnapping alleged several alternative aggravating factors but alleged only one victim and sought only one conviction for aggravated kidnapping, jury unanimity was not required as to the aggravating factors:\n\nBy virtue of being a result-oriented offense, we conclude that the allowable unit of prosecution for the offense of aggravated kidnapping relates to the abduction of a victim. \u00a0In other words, the State is allowed to prosecute a person for each victim kidnapped, not for the number of aggravating factors that may be present. \u00a0In this case, the State alleged one victim and has sought only a single conviction for the offense of aggravated kidnapping, regardless of the number of aggravating factors alleged in Count I. \u00a0Therefore, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that it could consider all of the aggravating factors alleged by the State and return a general verdict of guilty for the offense of aggravated kidnapping.\n\n\n\nId.\n\nThe \nGonzales\n court\u2019s analysis applies with equal force to our case. \u00a0The indictment charged several alternative means of committing aggravated kidnapping but sought conviction for a single kidnapping of a single victim. \u00a0The charge required juror unanimity on the gravamen of the offense, namely, that Appellant abducted Adam with the intent to prevent his liberation; the disjunctive portions of the charge pertain only to the means and manner of committing the offense and the aggravating circumstances. \u00a0\u00a0The trial court did not err by submitting the alternative means and aggravating factors to the jury disjunctively, and such submission did not deprive Appellant of a unanimous verdict. \u00a0\nSee id.\n \u00a0We overrule Appellant\u2019s fifth point.\n\nAppellant\u2019s sixth point pertains to his conviction for aggravated sexual assault. \u00a0His entire argument consists of three sentences in which Appellant contends that \u201cthe jury in order to find a conviction had to [wade] through a sea of \u2018or\u2019 (physical force \nor\n violence, commit \nor\n threaten\n, \nknife\n or\n gun).\u201d \u00a0\n\nA person commits sexual assault if the person intentionally or knowingly causes the penetration of the mouth of another person by the sexual organ of the actor without that person\u2019s consent. \u00a0Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a022.011(a)(1)(B) (Vernon Supp. 2008). \u00a0A sexual assault is without consent if the actor compels the person to submit or participate by the use of physical force or violence or by threatening to use force or violence and the other person believes that the actor has the present ability to execute the threat. \u00a0\nId. \n\u00a7\u00a022.011(b)(1), (2). \u00a0The same act rises to the level of aggravated assault if the actor uses or exhibits a deadly weapon. \u00a0\nId. \n\u00a7 22.021(a)(1)(A)(ii), (2)(A)(iv) (Vernon Supp. 2008). \u00a0\n\nThe indictment alleged that Appellant\n\ndid intentionally or knowingly cause the penetration of the mouth of [Ora] by inserting defendant\u2019s penis in [Ora\u2019s] mouth without the consent of [Ora] by compelling [Ora] to submit or participate by the use of physical force or violence or by threatening to use force or violence against [Ora] and [Ora] believed that the defendant had the present ability to execute said threat, and the defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon, to-wit: a shotgun, in the course of the same criminal episode.\n\n\n\nParagraph Two: And it is further presented . . . that the defendant did . . . intentionally or knowingly cause the penetration of the mouth of [Ora] by inserting defendant\u2019s penis in [Ora\u2019s] mouth without the consent of [Ora] by compelling [Ora] to submit or participate by the use of physical force or violence or by threatening to use force or violence against [Ora] and [Ora] believed that the defendant had the present ability to execute said threat, and the defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon, to-wit: a box cutter, that in the manner of its use or intended use was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury, in the course of the same criminal episode. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe court\u2019s charge tracked the indictment. \u00a0Thus, the indictment alleged that Appellant sexually assaulted Ora by inserting his penis into her mouth and compelled her to submit or participate through (1) the use of force or violence or (2) the threat of force or violence. \u00a0As the aggravating factor, the indictment alleged that Appellant exhibited or used either (1) a shotgun or (2) a box cutter. \u00a0The court\u2019s charge tracked the language of the indictment. \n\nAs with aggravated kidnapping, the charge required juror unanimity on the gravamen of a single offense: \u00a0Appellant\u2019s penetrating Ora\u2019s mouth with his penis without Ora\u2019s consent. \u00a0The jury could disagree about the \u201cmanner and means\u201d disjunctive elements in the charge\u2014Appellant\u2019s mental state, how he overcame Ora\u2019s lack of consent, and what deadly weapon Appellant used \u00a0\u2014but it could convict Appellant only if it unanimously agreed that he committed a single act, namely, that he penetrated Ora\u2019s mouth with his penis without her consent, and each juror concluded that at least one of the aggravating factors exists. \nSee \nJefferson\n, 189 S.W.3d at 312. \u00a0Juror unanimity was not required as to which of the aggravating factors exists. \u00a0\nSee Landrian\n, 268 S.W.3d at \n 533, 539 (\n\u201cThe jury did not have to be unanimous on the aggravating factors . . . . \u00a0Because the aggravated-assault statute defines two or more [aggravating] circumstances or factors . . ., the defendant may be convicted if each juror concludes that at least one of the aggravating factors or elements exist.\u201d).\n \n Thus, the aggravated sexual assault charge did not violate the constitutional unanimity requirement, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s sixth issue.\n\n3.\tElection\n\nIn his seventh and eighth points, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for the State to make an election with regard to both offenses. \u00a0At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Appellant requested an election as to the \u201c[m]anner and means of commission of the offense\u201d the State intended to rely on for conviction. \u00a0\n\nUpon a timely motion by the defendant, the State is required to make an election of those alleged acts upon which it will rely to pursue a conviction. \u00a0\nRenteria v. \nState, 199 S.W.3d 499, 507 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing \nGutierrez v. State\n, 8 S.W.3d 739, 748 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 1999, no pet.)). \u00a0This election requirement applies, however, only if an indictment alleges a single offense and the proof at trial shows the alleged offense occurred more than once. \u00a0\u00a0\nId. \n(citing \nScoggan v. State\n, 799 S.W.2d 679, 680 n.3 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990); \nMoore v. State\n, 143 S.W.3d 305, 312 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2004, pet. ref\u2019d)). \u00a0The State is not required to elect between separate manner and means of committing the same offense. \u00a0\nId. \nat 507\u201308\n \n(citing \nRodriguez v. State\n, 970 S.W.2d 66, 69 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, pet. ref\u2019d) (\u201cThe State may plead all three forms of delivery [of cocaine,] and it may not be forced to elect a particular method on which to prosecute.\u201d); \nBraughton v. State\n, 749 S.W.2d 528, 530 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1988, pet. ref\u2019d) (\u201cThe State need not elect between various theories alleged and the jury may consider all theories and return a general verdict of guilty.\u201d), \ncert. denied\n, 493 U.S. 870 (1989)).\n\nAs we noted in our analysis of Appellant\u2019s unanimity points, each indictment alleged a single criminal act but multiple manner and means theories. \u00a0Because each indictment alleged a single criminal act, the State was not required to elect between the various manner and means theories. \u00a0\nSee id. \u00a0\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s seventh and eighth issues.\n\n4.\tDouble jeopardy\n\nIn his ninth point, Appellant argues that his convictions subjected him to double jeopardy because \u201cin order to be convicted of aggravated kidnapping he was required to also be convicted of aggravated sexual assault, for which he had already been convicted, so that he was twice punished for the same conduct.\u201d \n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that no person shall be subjected to twice having life or limb in jeopardy for the same offense. \u00a0U.S. Const. amend. V. \u00a0Generally, this clause protects against (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense. \u00a0\nBrown v. Ohio\n, 432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 2225 (1977); \nEx parte Herron\n, 790 S.W.2d 623, 624 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (op. on reh\u2019g). \u00a0\n\nA\n defendant has the burden to \u201cpreserve, in some fashion,\u201d a double jeopardy objection at or before the time that the charge is submitted to the jury. \u00a0\nGonzalez v. State\n, 8 S.W.3d 640, 642 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). \u00a0Because of the fundamental nature of double jeopardy, however, a double jeopardy claim may be raised for the first time on appeal when \u201cthe undisputed facts show the double jeopardy violation is clearly apparent on the face of the record and when enforcement of usual rules of procedural default serves no legitimate state interests.\u201d \u00a0\nId.\n at 643. \u00a0\nWhen separate theories for an offense are issued to the jury disjunctively, a double jeopardy violation is not clearly apparent on the face of the record if one of the theories charged would not constitute a double jeopardy violation and there is sufficient evidence to support that valid theory. \u00a0\nLangs v. State\n, 183 S.W.3d 680, 687 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). \u00a0\nThe fact that the jury\u2019s verdict \ncould\n have relied on a theory that would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause is not sufficient to show a constitutional violation \u201cclearly apparent on the face of the record.\u201d \u00a0\nId.\n \n\nAppellant did not raise his double jeopardy argument in the trial court. \u00a0Thus, our focus is whether a double jeopardy violation is clearly apparent on the face of the record. \u00a0\nGonzalez\n, 8 S.W.3d at 643\n. \u00a0The aggravated kidnapping indictment alleged two alternative aggravating factors: (1) the intent to use Adam as a shield or hostage or (2) the intent to facilitate the commission of or flight after the commission of aggravated sexual assault. \u00a0We have already held that the evidence is sufficient to support Appellant\u2019s conviction under the \u201cshield or hostage\u201d allegation. \u00a0Thus, a double jeopardy violation is not clearly apparent on the face of the record. \u00a0\nSee Langs\n, 183 S.W.3d at 687\n. \u00a0We therefore overrule Appellant\u2019s ninth point.\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving overruled all of Appellant\u2019s points, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments.\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n\n\nPANEL: \u00a0GARDNER, WALKER, and MCCOY, JJ.\n\n\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\n\nTex.
