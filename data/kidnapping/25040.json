ROMERO\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n                             OPINION\n\nJudge Miller authored the opinion of the Court, in which\nChief Judge Eckerstrom concurred and Judge Espinosa dissented.\n\n\nM I L L E R, Judge:\n\n\u00b61           After a jury trial, Joseph Romero was convicted of\nsecond-degree murder. State v. Romero, 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 1, 341 P.3d\n493, 495 (App. 2014) (Romero I), vacated in part, 239 Ariz. 6, 365 P.3d\n358 (2016) (Romero II). He raised multiple issues on appeal and this\ncourt affirmed his conviction. Id. Our supreme court granted\nRomero\u2019s petition for review on a single issue\u2014whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by precluding Romero from offering\nexpert testimony criticizing the methods used by firearms examiners\nto match a gun to a crime. Romero II, 239 Ariz. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 10, 365 P.3d\nat 360, 361. The court held that the trial court erred, vacated a\nportion of our opinion, and remanded the case to this court for a\nsubstantive review of whether the error was harmless. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 31.\nBecause we find that the state has not proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the jury would have convicted Romero even had it heard\nthe precluded evidence, we reverse.\n\n                Factual and Procedural Background\n\n\u00b62           A detailed review of the facts appears in Romero II, thus\nwe limit our consideration to facts pertaining to harmless error.\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 2-9. Romero became a suspect in a seven-year-old homicide\nafter detectives, using previously-unexamined information in a cell\nphone left at the scene, questioned whether a .40-caliber Glock\nRomero had allegedly discarded a month after the homicide could\nhave been used to shoot the victim. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 2-5. Police firearms\nexpert Frank Powell test-fired the gun to retrieve the shell casings,\nwhich he compared with casings found at the scene of the murder.\nId. \u00b6 5. He concluded the casings matched. Id. Romero denied\ninvolvement in the murder, but did not challenge Powell\u2019s opinion\n\n\n                                  2\n\f                          STATE v. ROMERO\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\nby using testimony from another firearms identification expert. Id.\n\u00b6 6.\n\n\u00b63            After the first trial ended in a mistrial because the jury\ncould not reach a verdict, Romero proffered Ralph Haber as an\nexpert in the field of experimental design. Id. Haber generally\nopined that forensic firearms identification relies on unscientific\nstandards and methods. Id.; see also Romero I, 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 12, 341\nP.3d at 497. Romero also sought to exclude Powell\u2019s testimony,\narguing that firearms identification did not meet the requirements of\nRule 702, Ariz. R. Evid. Romero II, 239 Ariz. 6, \u00b6 6, 365 P.3d at\n360-61. The state moved to preclude Haber\u2019s testimony and\nopposed the motion to preclude Powell\u2019s toolmark testimony. Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The trial court denied the motion regarding Powell, but\ngranted the state\u2019s motion, finding that Haber was not qualified as\nan expert in firearms identification and that his testimony would\nimpermissibly allow the jury to make decisions generally reserved\nfor a Daubert1 hearing. Id. \u00b6 7. Our supreme court concluded it was\nerror to preclude Haber\u2019s testimony because he was qualified in\nscientific experimental design, potential deficiencies in the design of\nexperiments relating to toolmark analysis were relevant in assessing\nPowell\u2019s opinions, Haber\u2019s opinion did not impinge on the trial\ncourt\u2019s Rule 702 responsibilities, and Haber\u2019s lack of practical\nexperience in toolmark analysis only went to the weight of his\ntestimony. Romero II, 239 Ariz. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 17-29, 365 P.3d at 362-64. As\nnoted above, the court remanded the case to this court to determine\nwhether the preclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony was harmless. Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n\u00b64          We requested supplemental briefing from the parties to\nconsider whether, in light of our supreme court\u2019s reasoning,\npreclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony 2 requires us to reverse Romero\u2019s\n\n\n      1Daubert   v. Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).\n      2Haber   testified at the Daubert hearing.\n\n\n                                    3\n\f                        STATE v. ROMERO\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\nconvictions. The parties emphasized different aspects of the record.\nThe state primarily adopted the reasoning of our concurring\ncolleague in Romero I and argued that circumstantial evidence\nconnecting Romero to the scene of the crime was sufficiently\npersuasive to render it extremely unlikely that the ballistics\ntestimony was incorrect in also linking the gun to the crime, and\ntherefore the preclusion of Haber\u2019s opinion challenging that link was\nharmless. 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 69, 341 P.3d at 511 (Eckerstrom, C.J.,\nspecially concurring). Romero expanded his original argument to\nexplain how Haber\u2019s testimony would have supplemented the cross-\nexamination of Powell, and he suggests Haber could have convinced\nthe jury to reject Powell\u2019s opinion that the fatal bullets came from\nthe gun linked to Romero.\n\n\u00b65           The state focuses its argument principally on whether\nthe evidence unrelated to firearm identification shows\noverwhelmingly that the jury would have convicted Romero. This is\na guilt-focused argument that generally considers the weight of the\nuntainted, admissible evidence. In contrast, Romero contends that\nPowell\u2019s testimony provided the bedrock of a guilty verdict. This\nerror-focused argument primarily considers the effect of the error on\nthe trial. To address these arguably separate and independent\nperspectives, we first examine Arizona principles in our black-letter\nlaw and then the factors developed in case law.\n\n\u00b66            Although Arizona\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure and the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure instruct courts to disregard any\ntrial error that does not affect substantial rights, there is no\nanalogous rule of Arizona criminal procedure. See Ariz. R. Civ. P. 61\n(courts must disregard error that does not affect the substantial\nrights of the parties); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a) (error not affecting\nsubstantial rights must be disregarded). Arizona constitutional and\nstatutory law, however, proscribe reversal for a trial error if\n\u201csubstantial justice has been done,\u201d Ariz. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 27, or\nthere has been no prejudice to a \u201csubstantial right\u201d of the defendant,\nA.R.S. \u00a7 13-3987. Additionally, the United States Constitution\nprovides independent protections. See Chapman v. California, 386\nU.S. 18, 21 (1967) (\u201c[W]e cannot leave to the States the formulation of\n\n\n                                  4\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\nthe authoritative laws, rules, and remedies designed to protect\npeople from infractions by the States of federally guaranteed\nrights.\u201d). While an evidentiary error does not necessarily rise to the\nlevel of a deprivation of a constitutional right,3 the test for whether a\nsubstantial right has been affected does not vary depending on\nwhether the error arises out of procedural or constitutional law. See\nid. at 21-22 (declining to adopt rule that all federal constitutional\nerrors are harmful); see also State v. Ring, 204 Ariz. 534, \u00b6 45, 65 P.3d\n915, 933 (2003) (noting constitutional error may be harmless).\n\n\u00b67            \u201cIn deciding whether error is harmless, the question \u2018is\nnot whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty\nverdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty\nverdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to\nthe error.\u2019\u201d State v. Leteve, 237 Ariz. 516, \u00b6 25, 354 P.3d 393, 401\n(2015), quoting Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 279 (1993). An\nappellate court making this harmless-error determination \u201cdoes not\n. . . \u2018become in effect a second jury to determine whether a defendant\nis guilty.\u2019\u201d Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 19 (1999), quoting Roger\nJ. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 21 (1970). Nonetheless, the\nappellate standard parallels the evidentiary standard required to\nconvict: \u201cWe must be confident beyond a reasonable doubt that the\nerror had no influence on the jury\u2019s judgment.\u201d State v. Bible, 175\nAriz. 549, 588, 858 P.2d 1152, 1191 (1993). Beyond these broad\nstatements, there is no bright-line rule for what constitutes harmless\nerror. Id. Not surprisingly, to the extent that the harmless error\ndoctrine has been applied outside an analytical framework, it has\nbeen criticized as conclusory. See, e.g., D. Alex Winkelman et al., An\nEmpirical Method for Harmless Error, 46 Ariz. St. L.J. 1405, 1412-14\n\n\n      3The  Arizona Rules of Evidence generally correspond to the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, but nonetheless stand on an independent\nbasis and sometimes \u201cdeliberately depart\u201d from the federal rules.\nAriz. R. Evid., prefatory cmt. to 2012 amendments. Similarly,\nbecause our rules of evidence are founded in state procedural law,\n\u201cfederal court decisions interpreting the federal rule are persuasive\nbut not binding with respect to interpreting the Arizona rule.\u201d Id.\n\n\n                                   5\n\f                          STATE v. ROMERO\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n(2014); see also Charles S. Chapel, The Irony of Harmless Error, 51 Okla.\nL. Rev. 501, 505-06 & n.29 (1998) (criticizing harmless error review\nand listing other critical journal articles).\n\n\u00b68            In Bible, our supreme court favorably cited Weinstein\u2019s\nEvidence for the variety of factors frequently considered by courts.\n175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191. They are4:\n\n              (1) Whether the       other    evidence    is\n                  overwhelming;\n\n              (2) Whether the erroneously excluded or\n                  admitted evidence would have been\n                  primary evidence or material fact;\n\n              (3) Whether the party was able to present\n                  the substance of the claim or defense;\n\n              (4) The cumulative effect of all errors;\n\n              (5) Whether erroneously admitted or\n                  excluded    evidence      is    merely\n                  cumulative of similar evidence already\n                  received;\n\n              (6) Whether the relevant jury instructions\n                  were appropriate and useful;\n\n              (7) Whether the jury argument was based\n                  on tainted evidence; and\n\n              (8) The prejudicial effect of erroneously\n                  admitted or excluded evidence.\n\n1 Jack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal\nEvidence \u00a7 103.41[5] (2d ed. 2016) (hereinafter \u201cWeinstein\u201d). This list\nincorporates the approaches of both parties and allows a more\n\n      4 We   have changed the order of the factors to facilitate our\nanalysis.\n\n\n                                    6\n\f                        STATE v. ROMERO\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\nobjective basis to review for harmless error. Thus, we consider these\nfactors in light of all of the evidence below. See Bible, 175 Ariz. at\n588, 858 P.2d at 1191 (harmless error review is a case-specific factual\ninquiry based on all evidence). Not all factors will apply, nor will\nthey all carry the same weight in a particular case.5\n\nOverwhelming Evidence\n\n\u00b69          We begin with the issue of overwhelming evidence\nbecause it alone may be dispositive. For example, in Bible, the\nimproper admission of DNA evidence was found harmless because\nthe other evidence of guilt was \u201cfar beyond overwhelming.\u201d\n175 Ariz. at 588-89, 858 P.2d at 1191-92. The court in Bible detailed\nsix paragraphs of additional evidence that linked Bible to the\nabduction and murder of the victim. Id.\n\n\u00b610        The state6 contends there is overwhelming evidence of\nRomero\u2019s guilt because his cell phone was found at the scene of the\n\n\n      5 Our   dissenting colleague objects to the categorization of\nfactors as creating a fragmented approach which he suggests departs\nfrom the standards our supreme court has established. We\nrespectfully disagree. Bible first cited Weinstein for the factors\npotentially relevant in a harmless error analysis. 175 Ariz. at 588,\n858 P.2d at 1191. Moreover, each elucidated factor is based on or\nconsistent with Arizona case law.         In contrast, the dissent\u2019s\nconcluding reliance on State v. Anthony, 218 Ariz. 439, \u00b6 39, 189 P.3d\n366, 373 (2008), follows a summary description of one factor we\naddress in detail\u2014but which is separate from additional factors not\nlimited to evidence of guilt. We also observe that although the court\nin Anthony provided a very detailed recitation of the circumstantial\nevidence supporting the murder conviction, its conclusion that the\nevidentiary error was not harmless involved weighing the impact of\nthe improper evidence. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3-23, 40-42.\n      6The  dissent enlarges the discussion of several facts that are\nreferred to briefly by the state. To maintain context, we discuss\nthem here and with singular attribution to the state\u2019s position.\n\n\n                                  7\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\nshooting; the victim was in the contacts list of the phone; two of the\nmen seen fleeing the scene were described as Hispanic; one of the\nfleeing men referred to another as \u201cJoe\u201d; the description of the truck\nat the scene was similar to a Ford Ranger Romero had driven; and,\nRomero discarded a Glock one month after the shooting when he\nwas being followed by police. To determine the significance of the\nevidence, we start with the offense charged and then address\nspecific facts.\n\n\u00b611           Romero was indicted for first-degree murder, but the\njury was not instructed on accomplice liability; rather, it was\ninstructed only on the lesser offenses of second-degree murder and\nmanslaughter. Moreover, the state only argued to the jury that\nRomero fired the fatal bullet and explicitly rejected before the court\nan alternative liability theory. The limited charge and instructions,\nand the absence of argument to the contrary, precluded alternative\ntheories of criminal liability that might have included shots fired by\nother persons present at the scene. See, e.g., State v. King, 226 Ariz.\n253, \u00b6 16, 245 P.3d 938, 943 (App. 2011) (criminal liability may be\nbased on accomplice theory if state proves defendant aided or\nfacilitated commission of offense by principal). Thus, it was not\nsufficient to prove only that Romero was present and may have fired\na gun at the scene.\n\n\u00b612          The evidence unrelated to the Glock supports the\ncontention that Romero was at the scene, but it is not overwhelming.\nFor instance, the eyewitnesses differed as to whether there were two\nor three men running from the scene. The eyewitness who was able\nto estimate the height of the men initially described them as five feet,\nseven inches to five feet, eight inches, but added several inches to\nthe estimate in his trial testimony. Romero is six feet, one inch to six\nfeet, two inches. The same witness identified the truck as a Ford\nRanger or a Mazda pickup. Further, the evidence did not show that\nRomero was the exclusive driver of the Ford Ranger; rather, it\nsuggested he was merely one of its users. Finally, the name\nreference could have been mistaken for \u201cJoel,\u201d the victim\u2019s\nroommate and the initial suspect in the case. Notably, no witness\nknew Romero or could identify him at trial as a person at the scene.\n\n\n                                   8\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\u00b613           Even if we assume the eyewitness testimony and the\nlocation at the scene of a cell phone used by Romero suggests he was\none of the two or three men running after four or five shots were\nheard, it was the state\u2019s burden to prove Romero was the person\nwho actually fired the fatal shots. Moreover, although two bullets\nwere recovered from the victim\u2019s body, there was no evidence\nlinking those bullets to specific shell casings. Thus, the match of a\nGlock\u2014separately and independently linked to Romero\u2014to the\nshell casings found on the ground was the strongest evidence that he\nfired the shots. Removing from consideration a factual conclusion of\na match, the remaining evidence was arguably sufficient to survive a\nRule 20 motion, but the state\u2019s burden is greater: it must show\noverwhelming evidence. State v. Anthony, 218 Ariz. 439, \u00b6 41, 189\nP.3d 366, 373 (2008) (state\u2019s burden exceeds \u201cwhether the jury was\njustified in its verdict\u201d). Finally, we note that Romero\u2019s first trial\nresulted in a hung jury. See State v. Rich, 184 Ariz. 179, 181, 907 P.2d\n1382, 1384 (1995) (noting hung jury in conclusion error not\nharmless); see also Cobb v. State, 658 S.E.2d 750, 753 (Ga. 2008) (noting\n\u201cprior hung juries are a factor supporting a finding of harmful\nerror\u201d); State v. Edwards, 128 P.3d 631, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (Wash. Ct. App.\n2006) (noting previous hung jury in considering whether untainted\nevidence overwhelming). We are skeptical the prior jury would\nhave been unable to reach a verdict if the evidence was indeed as\n\u201coverwhelming\u201d as the state maintains. On this record, we cannot\nconclude there was overwhelming evidence that Romero fired the\ngun that killed the victim. See State v. Lehr, 201 Ariz. 509, \u00b6\u00b6 31-43,\n38 P.3d 1172, 1181-83 (2002) (preclusion of cross-examination and\ndefense expert testimony criticizing DNA testing not harmless\nwhere DNA was key evidence).\n\nPrimary Evidence\n\n\u00b614         In determining whether evidentiary errors are harmless,\ncourts also consider whether the error involved the admission or\nexclusion of primary evidence. Compare State v. Ontiveros-Loya,\n237 Ariz. 472, \u00b6 22, 352 P.3d 941, 947-48 (App. 2015) (error not\nharmless where erroneously admitted photographs \u201cstrongest\nevidence produced at trial\u201d that defendant possessed deadly\n\n\n                                   9\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\nweapon), with State v. Nelson, 146 Ariz. 246, 248-49, 705 P.2d 486,\n488-89 (App. 1985) (any error in admitting intoxilyzer test results\nharmless as to conviction for unlawful flight from pursuing law\nenforcement vehicle). Here, Haber\u2019s proposed testimony, generally\ncritiquing the science of firearms identification, would not have\nincluded evidence that Haber had reached a different conclusion\nthan Powell; it was only intended to weaken Powell\u2019s testimony that\nthe gun and shell casings matched, without directly contradicting\nPowell\u2019s findings. Haber\u2019s testimony therefore was not primary\nevidence. Cf. Petree v. Victor Fluid Power, Inc., 887 F.2d 34, 41-42 (3d\nCir. 1989) (erroneous preclusion of rebuttal evidence that \u201ctotally\ncontradicted\u201d defense \u201cstar witness\u201d not harmless).\n\nOpportunity to Present Claim or Defense\n\n\u00b615          Whether an error is harmless may also be considered in\nthe context of a party\u2019s ability to present the substance of his claim\nor defense. See, e.g., Gaston v. Hunter, 121 Ariz. 33, 52-53, 588 P.2d\n326, 345-46 (App. 1978) (exclusion of some expert opinions harmless\nwhere substance elicited at other times in trial). The substance of\nRomero\u2019s claim regarding the match of the gun was that not enough\nis known about the uniqueness of gun toolmarks 7 to warrant\nreliance on a match by an examiner. Romero impeached the\nfoundation of Powell\u2019s opinions in cross-examination using a report\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) that criticized \u201cthe\nlack of a precisely defined process\u201d in toolmark analysis, which\nmakes difficult \u201cwell-characterized confidence limits.\u201d          Nat\u2019l\nResearch Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States:\nA Path Forward 155 (2009). In fact, Haber\u2019s opinions relied in no\nsmall part on the NAS report. Accordingly, we conclude Romero\n\n\n\n\n      7A  \u201ctoolmark\u201d is the impression left on a softer surface when\nit comes into contact with a hard object. In this context, it refers to\nimprints left by the gun\u2019s firing pin and related parts on the bullet\ncasings. See generally United States v. Monteiro, 407 F. Supp. 2d 351,\n359-61 (D. Mass. 2006).\n\n                                  10\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\nwas able to present the substance of his challenge to the reliability of\nPowell\u2019s opinions.8\n\nCumulative Effect of Errors\n\n\u00b616          Evidentiary errors may compromise only a small\nportion of the total evidence or they may be repeated with a\nsignificant cumulative effect. See, e.g., Town of Paradise Valley v.\nLaughlin, 174 Ariz. 484, 487, 490, 851 P.2d 109, 112, 115 (App. 1992)\n(vacating and remanding due to \u201ccumulative effect of the court\u2019s\nerror,\u201d although preclusion of defendant\u2019s testimony alone would\nnot warrant new trial); Coyner Crop Dusters v. Marsh, 91 Ariz. 371,\n375, 372 P.2d 708, 711 (1962) (although new trial required because of\nincorrect jury instructions, other errors also considered because\n\u201ccumulative effect\u201d could result in unfair trial). In criminal cases,\nhowever, Arizona rejects the \u201ccumulative error doctrine\u201d outside the\ncontext of prosecutorial misconduct claims. State v. Hughes, 193\nAriz. 72, \u00b6 25, 969 P.2d 1184, 1190-91 (1998). Because there is no\nclaim of prosecutorial misconduct, this factor does not apply.\n\nCumulative Evidence\n\n\u00b617          The significance of evidence erroneously admitted or\nexcluded may depend on whether it is more of the same type of\nevidence properly admitted in the case. See, e.g., State v. Williams,\n133 Ariz. 220, 226, 650 P.2d 1202, 1208 (1982) (erroneous admission\nof hearsay harmless where cumulative to testimony at trial).\nCumulative evidence supports a fact \u201cotherwise established by\nexisting evidence\u201d; that is, it is not enough to be simply corroborated\n\n\n      8Romero   argues for the first time in his supplemental brief on\nremand that Powell changed the basis of his opinion between the\ntwo trials, by testifying at the first trial that he relied on the\n\u201cfingerprint\u201d of the breech face of the gun on the cartridge and, at\nthe second trial, that he was referring to \u201cshearing\u201d caused by up-\nand-down motion of the cartridge against the firing pin aperture at\nthe second trial. A review of the context of his testimony, however,\nindicates he was referring to the same marks at both trials.\n\n\n                                  11\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\nby other evidence, and it cannot be the very issue in dispute. State v.\nBass, 198 Ariz. 571, \u00b6 40, 12 P.3d 796, 806 (2000).\n\n\u00b618          That Romero was able to impeach Powell using the\nNAS report does not mean Haber\u2019s opinions would have been\ncumulative. For example, his proposed testimony provided context\nfor the report\u2019s criticism of firearms identification methods,\nexplaining how the accuracy of the field could be challenged. Haber\nalso could have responded directly to statements made by Powell.\nFor example, at the conclusion of Powell\u2019s testimony, a juror\nsubmitted a question as to whether a different examiner with similar\ntraining and experience would reach the same conclusion regarding\nthe shell casings, and Powell said he was \u201ccompletely confident.\u201d\nHaber\u2019s testimony would have addressed the scientific basis for that\nconfidence. Likewise, Haber would have been able to answer jury\nquestions. Ariz. R. Crim. P. 18.6(e). In this case, the expert\ntestimony would have augmented the cross-examination about the\nreport, rather than repeating it. Cf. State v. Ray, 123 Ariz. 171, 173 &\nn.1, 598 P.2d 990, 992 & n.1 (1979) (erroneous admission of\npreliminary hearing transcript not harmless where testimony\ncontained therein not cumulative).\n\nJury Instructions\n\n\u00b619           Errors also may be vitiated or exacerbated by jury\ninstructions. See Weinstein \u00a7 103.41[5]; cf. State v. Schroeder, 167 Ariz.\n47, 50-51, 804 P.2d 776, 780-81 (App. 1990) (expert\u2019s improper\ntestimony regarding credibility of victim cured by court\u2019s\nadmonition and instruction to jury regarding its role in determining\ncredibility). Here, the jury was instructed that it was \u201cnot bound by\nany expert opinion,\u201d and could choose how much weight to give the\nopinion. Although this allowed the jury to choose not to credit\nPowell\u2019s testimony, we cannot say it either vitiated or exacerbated\nthe error caused by the preclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony.\n\nJury Arguments\n\n\u00b620      The effect of erroneous rulings may also be\ncompounded by reference to missing or improper evidence in\n\n\n                                   12\n\f                          STATE v. ROMERO\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\narguments to the jury. See Mueller v. Hubbard Milling Co., 573 F.2d\n1029, 1037 (8th Cir. 1978) (error not harmless where counsel\nemphasized erroneously admitted evidence in closing argument);\nsee also State v. Watkins, 126 Ariz. 293, 299, 614 P.2d 835, 841 (1980)\n(error harmless where erroneously admitted evidence not\nmentioned in opening or closing arguments). Here, the prosecutor\nargued, \u201c[Y]ou cannot take [the criticisms in the National Academy\nof Science book] as some kind of evidence, because there is no\nevidence from this courtroom, from that witness stand that actually\nchallenges firearms analysis.\u201d Although the argument was not\nimproper in view of the preclusion ruling, it highlights the fact that\nthe absence of direct evidence challenging Powell\u2019s opinion was\nsufficiently important to the state\u2019s position that it argued to the jury\nthe NAS report should not be used to impeach Powell. We conclude\nthe state\u2019s emphasis on the defendant\u2019s lack of \u201cwitness stand\u201d\nevidence supporting the NAS report exacerbated the error of\nHaber\u2019s preclusion.\n\nPrejudice\n\n\u00b621          Prejudicial effect is implicit in all factors, but also stands\nas a catch-all category when consideration of a particular factor\nwould not otherwise apply. Here, the preclusion of a defense\nwitness who would have challenged the testimony of the state\u2019s\nexpert carried additional prejudice, because \u201c\u2018science\u2019 is often\naccepted in our society as synonymous with truth.\u201d Bible, 175 Ariz.\nat 578, 858 P.2d at 1181, quoting 1 Morris K. Udall et al., Arizona\nPractice: Law of Evidence \u00a7 102, at 212 (3d ed. 1991).\n\n                      Summary and Disposition\n\n\u00b622          Looking at \u201cthe trial record as a whole,\u201d United States v.\nHasting, 461 U.S. 499, 509 (1983), the evidence of guilt was not\noverwhelming, Haber\u2019s testimony was not cumulative, no jury\ninstruction ameliorated the error, and the arguments to the jury\ncompounded the error. We cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the preclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony had no influence on the\njury\u2019s verdict. Therefore, the error here was not harmless and we\n\n\n\n                                    13\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\nmust reverse. Romero\u2019s conviction and sentence are reversed, and\nthis case is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\nE C K E R S T R O M, Chief Judge, concurring:\n\n\u00b623          I join with Judge Miller\u2019s opinion in every respect. I\nwrite separately because I previously concluded that the trial court\u2019s\nerror in precluding Dr. Haber\u2019s testimony was harmless. Romero I,\n236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 69, 341 P.3d at 511 (Eckerstrom, C.J., specially\nconcurring). And, as my dissenting colleague correctly notes, the\nevidence in the case has not changed since I so reasoned.\n\n\u00b624          However, in light of the supplemental briefing and\nargument, I can no longer maintain that the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt\n\u201cwas surely unattributable to the error.\u201d Leteve, 237 Ariz. 516, \u00b6 25,\n354 P.3d at 401, quoting Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 279. My original\nreasoning, quoted at length in the dissent, overlooked that\nDr. Haber\u2019s testimony, if allowed, could have caused a juror to\nquestion the reliability of Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony altogether. As an\nable lawyer once wrote: \u201c[I]t is better to be only sometimes right,\nthan at all times wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be\nerroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.\u201d Abraham Lincoln,\nLetter to the People of Sangamo County (Mar. 9, 1832), reprinted in\nAbraham Lincoln: Speeches and Writings 1832-1858, at 1, 4-5 (Done E.\nFehrenbacher ed., 1989).\n\n\n\nE S P I N O S A, Judge, dissenting:\n\n\u00b625          I respectfully disagree with my colleagues for several\nreasons. First, I believe Arizona\u2019s existing legal framework for\nevaluating harmless error, articulated by our supreme court in\nnumerous cases, provides appropriate and adequate standards for\nresolving the legal issue remanded to us. See, e.g., State v. Valverde,\n220 Ariz. 582, \u00b6 11, 208 P.3d 233, 236 (2009); Anthony, 218 Ariz. 439,\n\u00b6 39, 189 P.3d at 373; Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191; State v.\nMcVay, 127 Ariz. 450, 453, 622 P.2d 9, 12 (1980). I therefore see no\n\n                                   14\n\f                         STATE v. ROMERO\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\nneed for the fragmented harmless error analysis adopted by the\nmajority, particularly on the facts of this case.\n\n\u00b626           The majority insists that it does not depart from our\nsupreme court\u2019s established standards by employing its own multi-\nfactor approach in evaluating harmless error, but I question that\nview and the necessity of such an approach here. Though Bible cited\nWeinstein, it did so in support of its declaration that \u201c[t]here is no\nbright line statement of what is and what is not harmless error,\u201d and\nonly noted generally that Weinstein \u201clist[ed] factors courts examine\nin determining whether error was harmless.\u201d 175 Ariz. at 588, 858\nP.2d at 1191. It did not, however, mention, let alone expressly\nadopt, any of those factors. See id. Moreover, the court further\nclarified that \u201c[d]ue to th[e] case-specific factual inquiry [involved],\nan error may be harmless in one case but require reversal in\nanother.\u201d Id. In my view, the supreme court\u2019s \u201cbroad statements\u201d\nare neither conclusory nor accidental; instead, it appears the court\nhas intentionally articulated flexible standards in order to account\nfor the great number of variables and factual considerations that\noften arise in multifaceted criminal cases.\n\n\u00b627           Second, I would conclude under either approach that\nthe state has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the\nexclusion of Romero\u2019s expert did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict.\nSee Leteve, 237 Ariz. 516, \u00b6 25, 354 P.3d at 401-02. As previously\nstated by my colleague who specially concurred in our first decision\nin this case:\n\n             Notwithstanding the relevance of [the\n             precluded]     testimony    to    significant\n             evidence against Romero, I would also\n             conclude the trial court\u2019s error was\n             harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n             Haber\u2019s testimony was brought exclusively\n             to challenge the weight the jury could place\n             on Powell\u2019s opinion that only Romero\u2019s\n             gun could have fired the fatal shots. But\n             there was other circumstantial evidence\n             connecting Romero to the scene of the\n\n                                  15\n\f                       STATE v. ROMERO\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\n            crime. [He] was both connected to a cell\n            phone found at the scene and a truck\n            observed leaving it. Given that the gun in\n            question was found with the very person\n            otherwise connected to the crime by two\n            other items of evidence, the results of\n            Powell\u2019s testing rendered the proposition\n            that another gun had fired the bullets\n            unlikely in the extreme. Put another way,\n            it would be an extraordinary coincidence if\n            a weapon creating such similar markings as\n            the murder weapon, but not involved in\n            the murder, would happen to be found\n            with Romero. Haber\u2019s testimony\u2014that\n            Powell\u2019s      methodology       could   not\n            scientifically exclude every other handgun\n            in circulation as having fired the weapon\u2014\n            would not have altered that stark fact.\n\nRomero I, 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 69, 341 P.3d at 511 (Eckerstrom, C.J.,\nspecially concurring). The evidence in this case has not changed\nsince those astute observations were made.\n\n\u00b628           Third, viewed in its entirety, overwhelming evidence,\nalbeit circumstantial, supported Romero\u2019s conviction, including\nDNA linking him to the gun, as well as to the cell phone found on\nthe ground beside the victim; a billing address also linking him to\nthe phone; eye-witness testimony that immediately after the shots\nwere fired one of the murder party said, \u201cdamn it, Joe, or something\nto that effect,\u201d using Romero\u2019s first name; and Romero\u2019s possession\nand, upon being followed by police, immediate disposal of a pistol\nof the same caliber used in the shooting\u2014another highly significant\nlink, even if the match between the gun and the shell casings at the\nscene were not confirmed. Thus, as suggested in my colleague\u2019s\nprevious concurrence, although the weight of one expert\u2019s testimony\nis disputed, \u201c[t]he other evidence, points with unerring consistency\nto one inarguable conclusion.\u201d Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at\n1191.\n\n\n                                16\n\f                        STATE v. ROMERO\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\u00b629          The majority reasons that the evidence only linked\nRomero to the scene, where at least two people were present, the\njury was not instructed on accomplice liability, and the match of the\ngun to the shell casings was the strongest evidence Romero was the\none who pulled the trigger. However, King, cited by the majority,\ndoes not say or suggest a jury cannot find guilt as an accomplice\nunless so instructed, 226 Ariz. 253, \u00b6\u00b6 14-20, 245 P.3d at 943-44, and\na jury is not ordinarily required to state the basis for its verdict,\ncf. State v. Hansen, 237 Ariz. 61, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22, 345 P.3d 116, 123\n(App. 2015) (noting courts do not second-guess jury\u2019s verdicts nor\ninquire into deliberative process; \u201c[a] court must simply accept the\nverdicts without probing into the jurors\u2019 thought processes or\ndemanding adherence to its instructions\u201d).\n\n\u00b630          Here, a question from the jury during its deliberations\nasked if Romero must have \u201cpulled the trigger\u201d to be convicted, to\nwhich the trial court only referred the jury to the instructions\nprovided. The court later noted it had omitted an accomplice\ninstruction through oversight. See State v. Rhymes, 129 Ariz. 56, 60,\n628 P.2d 939, 943 (1981) (accomplice to murder liable under A.R.S.\n\u00a7 13-303(A)(3) for substantive crime); State v. Rios, 217 Ariz.\n249, \u00b6 10, 172 P.3d 844, 846 (App. 2007) (accomplice with requisite\nmental state \u201cconsidered as liable as if he had personally committed\nthe offense\u201d).\n\n\u00b631           Finally, whether or not Romero might have been\nconvicted as an accomplice, once it was established that he was\npresent for the murder, additional evidence demonstrated his role as\na shooter: an eyewitness reported that \u201cboth\u201d people he had seen\nwere shooting at the victim, and it is manifestly evident that Romero\ndid not just wait in the truck because his cell phone was found on\nthe ground beside the victim\u2014Romero surely did not throw it out\nthe window at him, either before or after he was shot. None of these\nfacts or the other circumstantial evidence has any connection to the\nreliability of the firearms testing, but all go to the \u201cone inarguable\nconclusion,\u201d id., arrived at by the jury, that Romero was responsible\nfor the murder.\n\n\n\n\n                                 17\n\f                        STATE v. ROMERO\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\u00b632         Accordingly, applying our supreme court\u2019s well-\nestablished standards for harmless error to the issue and evidence\non remand, I would conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the\nexclusion of Romero\u2019s proffered expert \u201chad no influence on the\njury\u2019s judgment,\u201d Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588; \u201cthe guilty verdict actually\nrendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error,\u201d\nAnthony, 218 Ariz. 439, \u00b6 39, 189 P.3d at 373; and for those reasons\nwould uphold Romero\u2019s murder conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                  18\n\f",

The court held that the trial court erred, vacated a portion of our opinion, and remanded the case to this court for a substantive review of whether the error was harmless. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 31. Because we find that the state has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have convicted Romero even had it heard the precluded evidence, we reverse.\nFactual and Procedural Background\n\u00b6 2 A detailed review of the facts appears in Romero II, thus we limit our consideration to facts pertaining to harmless error. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 2-9. Romero became a suspect in a seven-year-old homicide after detectives, using previously-unexamined information in a cell phone left at the scene, questioned whether a .40-caliber dock Romero had allegedly discarded a month after the homicide could have been used to shoot the victim. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 2-5. Police firearms expert Frank Powell test-fired the gun to retrieve the shell casings, which he compared with casings found at the scene of the murder. Id. \u00b6 6. He concluded the casings matched. Id. Romero denied involvement in the murder, but did not challenge Powell\u2019s opinion by using testimony from another firearms identification expert. Id. \u00b6 6.\n\u00b6 3 After the first trial ended in a mistrial because the jury could not reach a verdict, Romero proffered Ralph Haber as an expert in the field of experimental design. Id. Haber generally opined that forensic firearms identification relies on unscientific standards and methods. Id.; see also Romero I, 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 12, 341 P.3d at 497. Romero also sought to exclude PoweU\u2019s testimony, arguing that firearms identification did not meet the requirements of Rule 702, Ariz. R. Evid. Romero II, 239 Ariz. 6, \u00b6 6, 365 P.3d at 360-61. The state moved to preclude Haber\u2019s testimony and opposed the motion to preclude Powell\u2019s toolmark testimony. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The trial court denied the motion regarding Powell, but granted the state\u2019s motion, finding that Haber was not qualified as an expert in firearms identification and that his testimony would impermissibly allow the jury to make decisions generally reserved for a Daubert1 hearing. Id. \u00b6 7. Our supreme court concluded it was error to preclude Haber\u2019s testimony because he was qualified in scientific experimental design, potential deficiencies in the design of experiments relating to tool-mark analysis were relevant in assessing Powell\u2019s opinions, Haber\u2019s opinion did not impinge on the trial court\u2019s Rule 702 responsibilities, and Haber\u2019s lack of practical experience in toolmark analysis only went to the weight of his testimony. Romero II, 239 Ariz. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 17-29, 365 P.3d at 362-64. As noted above, the court remanded the case to this court to determine whether the preclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony was harmless. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\nDiscussion\n\u00b64 We requested supplemental briefing from the parties to consider whether, in light of our supreme court\u2019s reasoning, preclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony2 requires us to reverse Romero\u2019s convictions. The parties empha*507sized different aspects of the record. The state primarily adopted the reasoning of onr concurring colleague in Romero I and argued that circumstantial evidence connecting Romero to the scene of the crime was sufficiently persuasive to render it extremely unlikely that the ballistics testimony was incorrect in also linking the gun to the crime, and therefore the preclusion of Haber\u2019s opinion challenging that link was harmless. 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 69, 341 P.3d at 511 (Eckerstrom, C.J., specially concurring). Romero expanded his original argument to explain how Haber\u2019s testimony would have supplemented the cross-examination of Powell, and he suggests Haber could have convinced the jury to reject Powell\u2019s opinion that the fatal bullets came from the gun linked to Romero.\n\u00b6 5 The state focuses its argument principally on whether the evidence unrelated to firearm identification shows overwhelmingly that the jury would have convicted Romero. This is a guilt-focused argument that generally considers the weight of the untainted, admissible evidence. In contrast, Romero contends that Powell\u2019s testimony provided the bedrock of a guilty verdict. This error-focused argument primarily considers the effect of the error on the trial. To address these arguably separate and independent perspectives, we first examine Arizona principles in oui' black-letter law and then the factors developed in case law.\n\u00b6 6 Although Arizona\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure instruct courts to disregard any trial error that does not affect substantial rights, there is no analogous rule of Arizona criminal procedure. See Ariz. R. Civ. P. 61 (courts must disregard error that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a) (error not affecting substantial rights must be disregarded). Arizona constitutional and statutory law, however, proscribe reversal for a trial error if \u201csubstantial justice has been done,\u201d Ariz. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 27, or there has been no prejudice to a \u201csubstantial right\u201d of the defendant, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3987. Additionally, the United States Constitution provides independent protections. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 21, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (\u201c[W]e cannot leave to the States the formulation of the authoritative laws, rules, and remedies designed to protect people from infractions by the States of federally guaranteed rights.\u201d). While an evidentiary error does not necessarily rise to the level of a deprivation of a constitutional right,3 the test for whether a substantial right has been affected does not vary depending on whether the error arises out of procedural or constitutional law. See id. at 21-22, 87 S.Ct. 824 (declining to adopt rule that all federal constitutional errors are harmful); see also State v. Ring, 204 Ariz. 534, \u00b6 45, 65 P.3d 915, 933 (2003) (noting constitutional error may be harmless).\n\u00b6 7 \u201cIn deciding whether error is harmless, the question \u2018is not whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error.\u2019 \u201d State v. Leteve, 237 Ariz. 516, \u00b6 25, 354 P.3d 393, 401 (2015), quoting Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 279, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993). An appellate court making this harmless-error determination \u201cdoes not ... \u2018become in effect a second jury to determine whether a defendant is guilty.\u2019 \u201d Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), quoting Roger J. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 21 (1970). Nonetheless, the appellate standard parallels the evidentiary standard required to convict: \u201cWe must be confident beyond a reasonable doubt that the error had no influence on the jury\u2019s judgment.\u201d State v. Bible, 175 Ariz. 549, 588, 858 P.2d 1152, 1191 (1993). Beyond these broad statements, there is no bright-line rule for what constitutes harmless error. Id. Not surprisingly, to the extent that the harmless error doctrine has been applied outside an analytical frame*508work, it has been criticized as conclusory. See, e.g., D. Alex Winkelman et al., An Empirical Method for Harmless Error, 46 Ariz. St. L.J. 1405, 1412-14 (2014); see also Charles S. Chapel, The Irony of Harmless Error, 51 Okla. L. Rev. 501, 505-06 &amp; n,29 (1998) (criticizing harmless error review and listing other critical journal articles).\n\u00b6 8 In Bible, our supreme court favorably cited Weinstein\u2019s Evidence for the variety of factors frequently considered by courts. 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191. They are4:\n(1) Whether the other evidence is overwhelming;\n(2) Whether the erroneously excluded or admitted evidence would have been primary evidence or material fact;\n(3) Whether the party was able to present the substance of the claim or defense;\n(4) The cumulative effect of all errors;\n(5) Whether erroneously admitted or excluded evidence is merely cumulative of similar evidence already received;\n(6) Whether the relevant jury instructions were appropriate and useful;\n(7) Whether the jury argument was based on tainted evidence; and\n(8) The prejudicial effect of erroneously admitted or excluded evidence.\n1 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 103.41[5] (2d ed. 2016) (hereinafter \u201cWeinstein\u201d). This list incorporates the approaches of both parties and allows a more objective basis to review for harmless error. Thus, we consider these factors in light of all of the evidence below. See Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191 (harmless error review is a case-specific factual inquiry based on all evidence). Not all factors will apply, nor will they all carry the same weight in a particular case.5\nOverwhelming Evidence\n\u00b6 9 We begin with the issue of overwhelming evidence because it alone may be dispositive. For example, in Bible, the improper admission of DNA evidence was found harmless because the other evidence of guilt was \u201cfar beyond overwhelming.\u201d 175 Ariz. at 588-89, 858 P.2d at 1191-92. The court in Bible detailed six paragraphs of additional evidence that linked Bible to the abduction and murder of the victim. Id.\n\u00b6 10 The state6 contends there is overwhelming evidence of Romero\u2019s guilt because his cell phone was found at the scene of the shooting; the victim was in the contacts list of the phone; two of the men seen fleeing the scene were described as Hispanic; one of the fleeing men referred to another as \u201cJoe\u201d; the description of the truck at the scene was similar to a Ford Ranger Romero had driven; and, Romero discarded a Glock one month after the shooting when he was being followed by police. To determine the significance of the evidence, we start with the offense charged and then address specific facts.\n\u00b6 11 Romero was indicted for first-degree murder, but the jury was not instructed on accomplice liability; rather, it was instructed only on the lesser offenses of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Moreover, the state only argued to the jury that Romero fired the fatal bullet and explicitly rejected before the court an alternative liability theory. The limited charge and instructions, and *509the absence of argument to the contrary, precluded alternative theories of criminal liability that might have included shots fired by other persons present at the scene. See, e.g., State v. King, 226 Ariz. 253, \u00b6 16, 246 P.3d 938, 943 (App.2011) (criminal liability may be based on accomplice theory if state proves defendant aided or facilitated commission of offense by principal). Thus, it was not sufficient to prove only that Romero was present and may have fired a gun at the scene.\n\u00b6 12 The evidence unrelated to the Glock supports the contention that Romero was at the scene, but it is not overwhelming. For instance, the eyewitnesses differed as to whether there were two or three men running from the scene. The eyewitness who was able to estimate the height of the men initially described them as five feet, seven inches to five feet, eight inches, but added several inches to the estimate in his trial testimony. Romero is six feet, one inch to six feet, two inches. The same witness identified the truck as a Ford Ranger or a Mazda pickup. Further, the evidence did not show that Romero was the exclusive driver of the Ford Ranger; rather, it suggested he was merely one of its users. Finally, the name reference could have been mistaken for \u201cJoel,\u201d the victim\u2019s roommate and the initial suspect in the case. Notably, no witness knew Romero or could identify him at trial as a person at the scene.\n\u00b6 13 Even if we assume the eyewitness testimony and the location at the scene of a cell phone used by Romero suggests he was one of the two or three men running after four or five shots were heard, it was the state\u2019s burden to prove Romero was the person who actually fired the fatal shots. Moreover, although two bullets were recovered from the victim\u2019s body, there was no evidence linking those bullets to specific shell casings. Thus, the match of a Glock\u2014separately and independently linked to Romero\u2014to the shell casings found on the ground was the strongest evidence that he fired the shots. Removing from consideration a factual conclusion of a match, the remaining evidence was arguably sufficient to survive a Rule 20 motion, but the state\u2019s burden is greater: it must show overwhelming evidence. State v. Anthony, 218 Ariz. 439, \u00b6 41, 189 P.3d 366, 373 (2008) (state\u2019s burden exceeds \u201cwhether the jury was justified in its verdict\u201d). Finally, we note that Romero\u2019s first trial resulted in a hung jury. See State v. Rich, 184 Ariz. 179, 181, 907 P.2d 1382, 1384 (1995) (noting hung jury in conclusion error not harmless); see also Cobb v. State, 283 Ga. 388, 658 S.E.2d 750, 753 (Ga. 2008) (noting \u201cprior hung juries are a factor supporting a finding of harmful error\u201d); State v. Edwards, 131 Wash.App. 611, 128 P.3d 631, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (Wash.Ct.App. 2006) (noting previous hung jury in considering whether untainted evidence overwhelming), We are skeptical the prior jury would have been unable to reach a verdict if the evidence was indeed as \u201coverwhelming\u201d as the state maintains. On this record, we cannot conclude there was overwhelming evidence that Romero fired the gun that killed the victim. See State v. Lehr, 201 Ariz. 509, \u00b6\u00b6 31-43, 38 P.3d 1172, 1181-83 (2002) (preclusion of cross-examination and defense expert testimony criticizing DNA testing not harmless where DNA was key evidence).\nPrimary Evidence\n\u00b6 14 In determining whether evi-dentiary errors are harmless, courts also consider whether the error involved the admission or exclusion of primary evidence. Compare State v. Ontiveros-Loya, 237 Ariz. 472, \u00b6 22, 352 P.3d 941, 947-48 (App.2015) (error not harmless where erroneously admitted photographs \u201cstrongest evidence produced at trial\u201d that defendant possessed deadly weapon), with State v. Nelson, 146 Ariz. 246, 248-49, 705 P.2d 486, 488-89 (App. 1985) (any error in admitting intoxilyzer test results harmless as to conviction for unlawful flight from pursuing law enforcement vehicle). Here, Haber\u2019s proposed testimony, generally critiquing the science of firearms identification, would not have included evidence that Haber had reached a different conclusion than Powell; it was only intended to weaken Powell\u2019s testimony that the gun and shell casings matched, without directly contradicting Powell\u2019s findings. Haber\u2019s testimony therefore was not primary evidence. Cf. Petree v. Victor Fluid Power, Inc., 887 F.2d 34, 41-42 (3d Cir.1989) (erroneous preclusion of rebuttal evidence that \u201ctotally contradicted\u201d defense \u201cstar witness\u201d not harmless).\n*510Opportunity to Present Claim or Defense\n\u00b6 15 Whether an error is harmless may also be considei\u2019ed in the context of a party\u2019s ability to present the substance of his claim or defense. See, e.g., Gaston v. Hunter, 121 Ariz. 33, 52-53, 588 P.2d 326, 345-46 (App.1978) (exclusion of some expert opinions harmless where substance elicited at other times in trial). The substance of Romero\u2019s claim regarding the match of the gun was that not enough is known about the uniqueness of gun toolmarks7 to warrant reliance on a match by an examiner. Romero impeached the foundation of Powell\u2019s opinions in cross-examination using a report from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) that criticized \u201cthe lack of a precisely defined process\u201d in toolmark analysis, which makes difficult \u201cwell-characterized confidence limits.\u201d Nat\u2019l Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 155 (2009). In fact, Haber\u2019s opinions relied in no small part on the NAS report. Accordingly, we conclude Romero was able to present the substance of his challenge to the reliability of Powell\u2019s opinions.8\nCumulative Effect of Errors\n\u00b6 16 Evidentiary errors may compromise only a small portion of the total evidence or they may be repeated with a significant cumulative effect. See, e.g., Town of Paradise Valley v. Laughlin, 174 Ariz. 484, 487, 490, 851 P.2d 109, 112, 115 (App.1992) (vacating and remanding due to \u201ccumulative effect of the court\u2019s error,\u201d although preclusion of defendant\u2019s testimony alone would not warrant new trial); Coyner Crop Dusters v. Marsh, 91 Ariz. 371, 375, 372 P.2d 708, 711 (1962) (although new trial required because of incorrect jury instructions, other errors also considered because \u201ccumulative effect\u201d could result in unfair trial). In criminal cases, however, Arizona rejects the \u201ccumulative error doctrine\u201d outside the context of prosecu-torial misconduct claims. State v. Hughes, 193 Ariz. 72, \u00b6 25, 969 P.2d 1184, 1190-91 (1998). Because there is no claim of prosecu-torial misconduct, this factor does not apply.\nCumulative Evidence\n\u00b6 17 The significance of evidence erroneously admitted or excluded may depend on whether it is more of the same type of evidence properly admitted in the case. See, e.g., State v. Williams, 133 Ariz. 220, 226, 650 P.2d 1202, 1208 (1982) (erroneous admission of hearsay harmless where cumulative to testimony at trial). Cumulative evidence supports a fact \u201cotherwise established by existing evidence\u201d; that is, it is not enough to be simply corroborated by other evidence, and it cannot be the very issue in dispute. State v. Bass, 198 Ariz. 571, \u00b6 40, 12 P.3d 796, 806 (2000).\n\u00b6 18 That Romero was able to impeach Powell using the NAS report does not mean Haber\u2019s opinions would have been cumulative. For example, his proposed testimony provided context for the report\u2019s criticism of firearms identification methods, explaining how the accuracy of the field could be challenged. Haber also could have responded directly to statements made by Powell. For example, at the conclusion of Powell\u2019s testimony, a juror submitted a question as to whether a different examiner with similar training and experience would reach the same conclusion regarding the shell casings, and Powell said he was \u201ccompletely confident.\u201d Haber\u2019s testimony would have addressed the scientific basis for that confidence. Likewise, Haber would have been able to answer jury questions. Ariz. R. Crim. P. 18.6(e). In this case, the expert testimony would have augmented the cross-examination about the report, rather than repeating it. Cf. State v. Ray, 123 Ariz. 171, 173 &amp; n.1, 598 *511P.2d 990, 992 &amp; n.1 (1979) (erroneous admission of preliminary hearing transcript not harmless where testimony contained therein not cumulative).\nJury Instructions\n\u00b6 19 Errors also may be vitiated or exacerbated by jury instructions. See Weinstein \u00a7 103.41[5]; cf. State v. Schroeder, 167 Ariz. 47, 50-51, 804 P.2d 776, 780-81 (App. 1990) (expert\u2019s improper testimony regarding credibility of victim cured by court\u2019s admonition and instruction to jury regarding its role in determining credibility). Here, the jury was instructed that it was \u201cnot bound by any expert opinion,\u201d and could choose how much weight to give the opinion. Although this allowed the jury to choose not to credit Powell\u2019s testimony, we cannot say it either vitiated or exacerbated the error caused by the preclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony.\nJury Arguments\n\u00b6 20 The effect of erroneous rulings may also be compounded by reference to missing or improper evidence in arguments to the jury. See Mueller v. Hubbard Milling Co., 573 F.2d 1029, 1037 (8th Cir.1978) (error not harmless where counsel emphasized erroneously admitted evidence in closing argument); see also State v. Watkins, 126 Ariz. 293, 299, 614 P.2d 835, 841 (1980) (error harmless where erroneously admitted evidence not mentioned in opening or closing arguments). Here, the prosecutor argued, \u201c[Y]ou cannot take [the criticisms in the National Academy of Science book] as some kind of evidence, because there is no evidence from this courtroom, from that witness stand that actually challenges firearms analysis.\u201d Although the argument was not improper in view of the preclusion ruling, it highlights the fact that the absence of direct evidence challenging Powell\u2019s opinion was sufficiently important to the state\u2019s position that it argued to the jury the NAS report should not be used to impeach Powell. We conclude the state\u2019s emphasis on the defendant\u2019s lack of \u201cwitness stand\u201d evidence supporting the NAS report exacerbated the error of Haber\u2019s preclusion.\nPrejudice\n\u00b6 21 Prejudicial effect is implicit in all factors, but also stands as a catch-all category when consideration of a particular factor would not otherwise apply. Here, the preclusion of a defense witness who would have challenged the testimony of the state\u2019s expert carried additional prejudice, because \u201c \u2018science\u2019 is often accepted in our society as synonymous with truth.\u201d Bible, 175 Ariz. at 578, 858 P.2d at 1181, quoting 1 Morris K. Udall et al., Arizona Practice: Law of Evidence \u00a7 102, at 212 (3d ed. 1991).\nSummary and Disposition\n\u00b6 22 Looking at \u201cthe trial record as a whole,\u201d United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983), the evidence of guilt was not overwhelming, Haber\u2019s testimony was not cumulative, no jury instruction ameliorated the error, and the arguments to the jury compounded the error. We cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the preclusion of Haber\u2019s testimony had no influence on the jury\u2019s verdict. Therefore, the error here was not harmless and we must reverse. Romero\u2019s conviction and sentence are reversed, and this case is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.\n\n. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).\n\n\n. Haber testified at the Daubert hearing.\n\n\n. The Arizona Rules of Evidence generally correspond to the Federal Rules of Evidence, but nonetheless stand on an independent basis and sometimes \"deliberately depart\u201d from the federal rules. Ariz. R. Evid., prefatory cmt. to 2012 amendments. Similarly, because our rules of evidence are founded in state procedural law, \"federal court decisions interpreting the federal rule are persuasive but not binding with respect to interpreting the Arizona rule.\u201d Id.\n\n\n. We have changed the order of the factors to facilitate our analysis.\n\n\n. Our dissenting colleague objects to the categorization of factors as creating a fragmented approach which he suggests departs from the standards our supreme court has established. We respectfully disagree. Bible first cited Weinstein for the factors potentially relevant in a harmless error analysis. 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191, Moreover, each elucidated factor is based on or consistent with Arizona case law. In contrast, the dissent\u2019s concluding reliance on State v. Anthony, 218 Ariz. 439, \u00b6 39, 189 P.3d 366, 373 (2008), follows a summary description of one factor we address in detail\u2014but which is separate from additional factors not limited to evidence of guilt. We also observe that although the court in Anthony provided a very detailed recitation of the circumstantial evidence supporting the murder conviction, its conclusion that the evidentiary error was not harmless involved weighing the impact of the improper evidence. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3-23, 40-42.\n\n\n.The dissent enlarges the discussion of several facts that are referred to briefly by the state. To maintain context, we discuss them here and with singular attribution to the state's position.\n\n\n. A \"toolmark\u201d is the impression left on a softer surface when it comes into contact with a hard object. In this context, it refers to imprints left by the gun\u2019s firing pin and related parts on the bullet casings. See generally United States v. Monteiro, 407 F.Supp.2d 351, 359-61 (D.Mass.2006).\n\n\n. Romero argues for the first time in his supplemental brief on remand that Powell changed the basis of his opinion between the two trials, by testifying at the first trial that he relied on the \u201cfingerprint\" of the breech face of the gun on the cartridge and, at the second trial, that he was referring to \"shearing\u201d caused by up-and-down motion of the cartridge against the firing pin aperture at the second trial. A review of the context of his testimony, however, indicates he was referring to the same marks at both trials.\n\n",

Romero I, 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 69, 341 P.3d at 511 (Eckerstrom, C.J., specially concurring). And, as my dissenting colleague correctly notes, the evidence in the case has not changed since I so reasoned.\n\u00b6 24 However, in light of the supplemental briefing and argument, I can no longer maintain that the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt \u201cwas surely unattributable to the error.\u201d Leteve, 237 Ariz. 516, \u00b6 25, 354 P.3d at 401, quoting Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 279, 113 S.Ct. 2078.

As an able lawyer once *512wrote: \u201c[I]t is better to be only sometimes right, than at all times wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, Letter to the People of Sangamo County (Mar. 9, 1832), reprinted in Abraham Lincoln: Speeches and Writings 1882-1858, at 1, 4-5 (Done E. Fehrenbacher ed., 1989).\n",

            "opinion_text": "\nESPINOSA, Judge,\ndissenting:\n\u00b6 25 I respectfully disagree with my colleagues for several reasons. First, I believe Arizona\u2019s existing legal framework for evaluating harmless error, articulated by our supreme court in numerous cases, provides appropriate and adequate standards for resolving the legal issue remanded to us. See, e.g., State v. Valverde, 220 Ariz. 582, \u00b6 11, 208 P.3d 233, 236 (2009); Anthony, 218 Ariz. 439, \u00b6 39, 189 P.3d at 373; Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191; State v. McVay, 127 Ariz. 450, 453, 622 P.2d 9, 12 (1980). I therefore see no need for the fragmented harmless error analysis adopted by the majority, particularly on the facts of this case.\n\u00b6 26 The majority insists that it does not depart from our supreme court\u2019s established standards by employing its own multi-factor approach in evaluating harmless error, but I question that view and the necessity of such an approach here. Though Bible cited Wein-stein, it did so in support of its declaration that \u201c[t]here is no bright line statement of what is and what is not harmless error,\u201d and only noted generally that Weinstein \u201clist[ed] factors courts examine in determining whether error was harmless.\u201d 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191. It did not, however, mention, let alone expressly adopt, any of those factors. See id. Moreover, the court further clarified that \u201c[d]ue to th[e] case-specific factual inquiry [involved], an error may be harmless in one ease but require reversal in another.\u201d Id. In my view, the supreme court\u2019s \u201cbroad statements\u201d are neither con-elusory nor accidental; instead, it appears the court has intentionally articulated flexible standards in order to account for the great number of variables and factual considerations that often arise in multifaceted criminal cases.\n\u00b6 27 Second, I would conclude under either approach that the state has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the exclusion of Romero\u2019s expert did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. See Leteve, 237 Ariz. 516, \u00b6 25, 354 P.3d at 401-02. As previously stated by my colleague who specially concurred in our first decision in this case:\nNotwithstanding the relevance of [the precluded] testimony to significant evidence against Romero, I would also conclude the trial court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Haber\u2019s testimony was brought exclusively to challenge the weight the jury could place on Powell\u2019s opinion that only Romero\u2019s gun could have fired the fatal shots. But there was other circumstantial evidence connecting Romero to the scene of the crime. [He] was both connected to a cell phone found at the scene and a truck observed leaving it. Given that the gun in question was found with the very person otherwise connected to the crime by two other items of evidence, the results of Powell\u2019s testing rendered the proposition that another gun had fired the bullets unlikely in the extreme. Put another way, it would be an extraordinary coincidence if a weapon creating such similar markings as the murder weapon, but not involved in the murder, would happen to be found with Romero. Haber\u2019s testimony\u2014that Powell\u2019s methodology could not scientifically exclude every other handgun in circulation as having fired the weapon\u2014 would not have altered that stark fact.\nRomero I, 236 Ariz. 451, \u00b6 69, 341 P.3d at 511 (Eckerstrom, C.J., specially concurring). The evidence in this case has not changed since those astute observations were made.\n\u00b6 28 Third, viewed in its entirety, overwhelming evidence, albeit circumstantial, supported Romero\u2019s conviction, including DNA linking him to the gun, as well as to the cell phone found on the ground beside the victim; a billing address also linking him to the phone; eye-witness testimony that immediately after the shots were fired one of the murder party said, \u201cdamn it, Joe, or something to that effect,\u201d using Romero\u2019s first name; and Romero\u2019s possession and, upon being followed by police, immediate disposal *513of a pistol of the same caliber used in the shooting\u2014another highly significant link, even if the match between the gun and the shell casings at the scene were not confirmed. Thus, as suggested in my colleague\u2019s previous concurrence, although the weight of one expert\u2019s testimony is disputed, \u201c[t]he other evidence, points with unerring consistency to one inarguable conclusion.\u201d Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d at 1191.\n\u00b6 29 The majority reasons that the evidence only linked Romero to the scene, where at least two people were present, the jury was not instracted on accomplice liability, and the match of the gun to the shell casings was the strongest evidence Romero was the one who pulled the trigger. However, King, cited by the majority, does not say or suggest a jury cannot find guilt as an accomplice unless so instructed, 226 Ariz. 253, \u00b6\u00b6 14-20, 245 P.3d at 943-44, and a jury is not ordinarily required to state the basis for its verdict, cf. State v. Hansen, 237 Ariz. 61, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22, 345 P.3d 116, 123 (App.2015) (noting courts do not second-guess jury\u2019s verdicts nor inquire into deliberative process; \u201c[a] court must simply accept the verdicts without probing into the jurors\u2019 thought processes or demanding adherence to its instructions\u201d).\n\u00b6 30 Here, a question from the jury during its deliberations asked if Romero must have \u201cpulled the trigger\u201d to be convicted, to which the trial court only referred the jury to the instructions provided. The court later noted it had omitted an accomplice instruction through oversight. See State v. Rhymes, 129 Ariz. 56, 60, 628 P.2d 939, 943 (1981) (accomplice to murder liable under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-303(A)(3) for substantive crime); State v. Rios, 217 Ariz. 249, \u00b6 10, 172 P.3d 844, 846 (App.2007) (accomplice with requisite mental state \u201cconsidered as liable as if he had personally committed the offense\u201d).\n\u00b6 31 Finally, whether or not Romero might have been convicted as an accomplice, once it was established that he was present for the murder, additional evidence demonstrated his role as a shooter: an eyewitness reported that \u201cboth\u201d people he had seen were shooting at the victim, and it is manifestly evident that Romero did not just wait in the truck because his cell phone was found on the ground beside the victim\u2014Romero surely did not throw it out the window at him, either before or after he was shot. None of these facts or the other circumstantial evidence has any connection to the reliability of the firearms testing, but all go to the \u201cone inarguable conclusion,\u201d id. arrived at by the jury, that Romero was responsible for the murder.\n\u00b6 32 Accordingly, applying our supreme court\u2019s well-established standards for harmless error to the issue and evidence on remand, I would conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the exclusion of Romero\u2019s proffered expert \u201chad no influence on the jury\u2019s judgment,\u201d Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588, 858 P.2d 1152; \u201cthe guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error,\u201d Anthony, 218 Ariz. 439, \u00b6 39, 189 P.3d at 373; and for those reasons would uphold Romero\u2019s murder conviction.\n",
