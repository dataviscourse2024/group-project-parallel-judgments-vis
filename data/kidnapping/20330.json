We affirmed the trial court\n\nconviction in each case. See Layton v. State, No. 07-96-0234-CR, 1997 Lexis 5257 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2013Amarillo Oct. 3, 1997, pet. ref\u2019d); Layton v. State, No. O7-96-O235-CR, 1997 Lexis\n\n\n\n      1\n      John T. Boyd, Chief Justice (Ret.), Seventh Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.\nTex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a775.002(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2004-2005).\n\f5258 (Tex. App.\u2013Amarillo Oct. 3, 1997, pet. ref\u2019d); and Layton v State, No. 07-96-0236-CR,\n\n1997 Lexis 5259 (Tex. App.\u2013Amarillo Oct. 3, 1997, pet. ref\u2019d). Appellant now asserts that\n\nthe trial court reversibly erred in denying his motions for post-conviction forensic DNA\n\ntesting. For the reasons set out below, we disagree the trial court erred, and we affirm the\n\ntrial court\u2019s denial of those motions.\n\n\n       Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 64.03(a)(2)(A) provides that a trial court\n\nmay only order forensic DNA testing if the convicted person establishes by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the person would not have been convicted if\n\nexculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing. Tex. Code Crim Proc. Ann.\n\nart 64.03(a)(2)(A) (Vernon Supp. 2004-05). In advancing his contention that his motions\n\nshould have been granted, appellant, for the most part, again challenges in some detail the\n\nlegal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction. In addition, he\n\nspecifically argues that the victims never made a firm identification of him as the culprit and\n\nemphasizes that the State\u2019s evidence shows he arrived at the scene of the crimes just after\n\nthe commission of the crimes.\n\n\n       However, the evidence in these cases was reviewed in somewhat exhaustive detail\n\nin our opinions affirming the convictions, and appellant has not presented any contentions\n\nhere that were not within the bounds of our prior discussion of the sufficiency of the trial\n\nevidence.   Because of the nature of the evidence sustaining appellant\u2019s conviction,\n\nappellant has not borne his burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he\n\nwould not have been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained\n\nthrough DNA testing.\n\n                                              2\n\f      Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s amended motions for DNA testing\n\nof evidence must be, and are hereby, affirmed in each case.\n\n\n\n                                                John T. Boyd\n                                                Senior Justice\n\nDo not publish.\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f",
