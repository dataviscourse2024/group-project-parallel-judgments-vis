The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing (Zelman, J.), of that branch of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which was to suppress statements made by him to the police.\nOrdered that the judgment is affirmed.\nWe find no reason to disturb Criminal Term\u2019s determination that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s request to suppress his statements on the ground that they were the fruit of an unlawful arrest was properly denied.\nIn addition, since the defendant failed to raise any objection to the sufficiency of the plea allocution in the court of first instance, he has failed to preserve this issue for appellate review as a matter of law (see, People v Pellegrino, 60 NY2d 636). In any event, we find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim. Mollen, P. J., Bracken, Lawrence, Kooper and Sullivan, JJ., concur.\n",
