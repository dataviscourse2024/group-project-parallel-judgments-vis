However, should this Court determine that its decisional\n\nprocess will be significantly aided by oral argument, Appellant will be honored to\n\npresent oral argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 8 of 30\n\fTo The Honorable Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals:\n\n       Appellant Justin Davis Johnson respectfully submits this petition for\n\ndiscretionary review:\n\n\nVI. Statement of the Case and Procedural History\n\n       This petition for discretionary review requests that this Court review the\n\njudgment and opinion of the Seventh Court of Appeals in Johnson v. State, ___\n\nS.W.3d ___, No. 07-13-00158-CR, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520 (Tex. App.\n\nAmarillo 2014) (designated for publication). (See Appendix 1). On February 15,\n\n2013, in the 355th Judicial District Court of Hood County, under Cause Number\n\nCR12127, Appellant was convicted by a jury of Aggravated Assault with a Deadly\n\nWeapon by Threat and of Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon Causing\n\nSerious Bodily Injury. (RR5, 66-69; CR, 82-90).1; See Tex. Pen. Code \u00a7 22.02\n\n(2011).\n\n       On February 19, 2013, for the Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon by\n\nThreat, the same jury sentenced Appellant to six years to the Texas Department of\n\nCriminal Justice, Institutional Division.         (RR6, 61-63; CR, 82-90).           For the\n\nAggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon Causing Serious Bodily Injury, the jury\n\n\n1\n The Clerk\u2019s Record, which is comprised of a single volume and a sealed volume, is referenced\nthroughout this Brief as \u201cCR\u201d or \u201cCR-Sealed\u201d followed by the page number of the Clerk\u2019s\nRecord. The Reporter\u2019s Record, which is comprised of ten volumes, is referenced throughout\nthis Brief as \u201cRR\u201d followed by the volume number and page number.\n\n\n                                         Page 9 of 30\n\fsentenced Appellant to 12 years to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice,\n\nInstitutional Division. (RR6, 61-63; CR, 82-90). The judgments of conviction and\n\nsentences are under two separate documents entitled Judgment of Conviction by\n\nJury. (CR, 82-90). The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. (CR, 82-90).\n\n      Appellant appealed the Judgments of Conviction by Jury and sentences to\n\nthe Seventh Court of Appeals. On November 19, 2014, the Seventh Court of\n\nAppeals affirmed the Judgments of Conviction by Jury and sentences. Johnson v.\n\nState, ___ S.W.3d ___, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520.

Grounds for Review\n\nGround for Review One: The Court of Appeals erred (Issue One) when it\nconcluded that the evidence is legally sufficient to prove that Appellant was\nunjustified in using deadly force in defense of his person against Armstrong\u2019s use\nor attempted use of unlawful deadly force or to prevent Armstrong\u2019s imminent\ncommission of aggravated kidnapping because: (1) the jury was not free to\ndisregard the 911 recording in which a witness was heard by the jury, who during\ntrial provided materially conflicting testimony; and (2) in its analysis, the Court of\nAppeals ignored the evidence from the 911 recording\n\nGround for Review Two: The Court of Appeals erred (Issue Two) when it\nconcluded that the evidence is legally sufficient to prove that Appellant committed\nAggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon by Threat because: (1) the jury was not\nfree to disregard the 911 recording in which a witness was heard by the jury, who\nduring trial provided materially conflicting testimony; and (2) in its analysis, the\nCourt of Appeals ignored the evidence from the 911 recording.\n\nGround for Review Three: The Court of Appeals erred (Issues Three and Four)\nwhen it concluded that Appellant waived the issues of Smithson testifying in\nviolation of Appellant\u2019s constitutional rights to confrontation when in violation of\nits own Standard Discovery Order, the trial court abused its discretion and allowed\nSmithson to testify as an expert. Appellant\u2019s objections were clearly objections\nunder the confrontation clause.\n\nGround for Review Four: The Court of Appeals erred (Issues Three, Four, and\nFive) when it ruled that although the trial court failed to follow its own standard\ndiscovery order by allowing Smithson and Frisbie to testify as experts, \u201cthe trial\ncourt did not engage in any judicial impropriety by simply ruling on the\nadmissibility of evidence.\u201d This was not merely an issue regarding the\nadmissibility of evidence. This issue is about evidence being willfully withheld\nfrom disclosure under a discovery order, and evidence that should have been\nexcluded as this Court ruled in Oprean v. State, 201 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2006).\n\n      The relevant pages of the record are: Clerk\u2019s Record 82-90, and the\n\nfollowing pages of the Reporter\u2019s Record:\n\nRR2: 38, 47, 48, 52-75, 80-99, 107-135, 144-191, 216-312\n\n                                    Page 11 of 30\n\fRR3: 10-46, 68-71, 272-301, 311-313, 343\n\nRR4: 40-49, 70-91, 284-338, 345-349, 403\n\nRR6: 61-63\n\nRR7: SX-4, SX-21, SX-61, SX-67, SX-67, SX-81-85, SX-89, SX-103\n\nRR9: DX-1, DX-2, DX-3\n\nSee Tex.

Ground for Review One: The Court of Appeals erred (Issue One) when\n      it concluded that the evidence is legally sufficient to prove that\n      Appellant was unjustified in using deadly force in defense of his person\n      against Armstrong\u2019s use or attempted use of unlawful deadly force or to\n      prevent Armstrong\u2019s imminent commission of aggravated kidnapping\n      because: (1) the jury was not free to disregard the 911 recording in\n      which a witness was heard by the jury, who during trial provided\n      materially conflicting testimony; and (2) in its analysis, the Court of\n      Appeals ignored the evidence from the 911 recording.\n\n         i. Introduction\n      In the first issue on appeal, Appellant argued that the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to prove that he was unjustified in using deadly force in defense of his\n\nperson against Armstrong\u2019s use or attempted use of unlawful deadly force or to\n\nprevent Armstrong\u2019s imminent commission of aggravated kidnapping because: (1)\n\nAppellant was justified in using deadly force to defend himself against\n\nArmstrong\u2019s attack; (2) the State did not meet its burden of proof to disprove the\n\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) Appellant had no duty to retreat; and (4)\n\neven if Appellant had a duty to retreat, it is uncontroverted that Appellant tried to\n\nretreat but was prevented by Armstrong.\n\n      Setting aside all witness testimony and focusing only on the 911 call made\n\nby Bolsinger, Bolsinger calls 911 and tells the operator that the shooting was an\n\n\u201caccidental discharge.\u201d (RR2, 184, 283, 284, 286, 310; RR3, 216; RR7, SX-89).\n\nBolsinger also tells the 911 operator that Armstrong suffered a single gunshot\n\n\n                                    Page 13 of 30\n\fwound to the jaw and the back of the neck. (RR2, 285-287; RR7, SX-89:2:00).\n\nWhat Bolsinger told the 911 operator was almost immediately corroborated by\n\nBolsinger because shortly after the incident, Bolsinger told an investigator that he\n\n(Bolsinger) had no reason to believe that Appellant shot Armstrong on purpose.\n\n(RR2, 311).\n\n      On the recording, Bolsinger never tells the 911 operator that Appellant\n\npointed a gun at him (Bolsinger) or demanded keys as Bolsinger later claimed at\n\ntrial. (RR2, 295). In fact, it was only after the 911 operator told Bolsinger to turn\n\nArmstrong on his side if Armstrong vomits or if he has trouble breathing that\n\nBolsinger discovers that Armstrong has another wound in his back. (RR2, 191,\n\n288-289; RR7, SX-89). Contrary to his testimony at trial, on the 911 recording,\n\nBolsinger never tells the operator that he heard a second shot or that he saw\n\nAppellant shoot Armstrong a second time. (RR2, 300, 312).\n\n\n         ii. The findings of fact by the Court of Appeals do not comport with\n             the facts presented at trial\n\n      In its opinion, the Court of Appeals completely ignores the 911 recording.\n\nInstead, the Court of Appeals concludes that \u201c[T]he jury\u2019s decision to reject\n\nAppellant\u2019s defensive claims ultimately hinges on the credibility of witnesses.\u201d\n\nJohnson, Id. at *6.    The Court of Appeals then made findings regarding the\n\ntestimony of Appellant, Bolsinger, and Armstrong. Id. at *6-7. Even in doing\n\n\n                                    Page 14 of 30\n\fso, the Court of Appeals does not acknowledge the following regarding\n\nArmstrong\u2019s testimony: (1) that Armstrong did not recall Appellant\u2019s demeanor\n\nafter Armstrong grabbed Appellant by the neck (RR2, 107); (2) Armstrong did not\n\nrecall trying to take off Appellant\u2019s boots or clothes (RR2, 113); (3) Armstrong\n\npreviously denied any physical contact with Appellant other than perhaps having\n\n\u201cstiff-armed\u201d Appellant (RR2, 85, 91); and (4) Armstrong\u2019s recollection of what\n\noccurred was not reliable, as his version of the events changed materially three\n\ntimes. (RR3, 68-71; RR7, SX-103, p. 22).\n\n\n          iii. The jury was not free to disregard the 911 recording in which a\n               witness was heard by the jury, who during trial provided\n               materially conflicting testimony\n       When a reviewing court considers legal sufficiency, it reviews all the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether any\n\nrational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was\n\nguilty, or whether the same rational jury found that the State disproved a defense\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 912 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2010); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); Clayton v. State, 235\n\nS.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Saxton v. State, 804 S.W.2d 910, 912\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1991); and Luck v. State, 588 S.W.2d 371, 375 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1976). Under Brooks, a reviewing court must give deference to the responsibility\n\nof the jury to \u201cgive full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve\n\n                                       Page 15 of 30\n\fconflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable\n\ninferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d Brooks, Id. at 916; citing Jackson v.\n\nVirginia, Id. at 319; see also Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2007). And when conducting a legal sufficiency review, a reviewing court\n\nconsiders all evidence in the record of the trial, whether admissible or\n\ninadmissible. Winfrey v. State, 393 S.W.3d 763, 767 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013);\n\nConner v. State, 67 S.W.3d 192, 197 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); Powell v. State, 194\n\nS.W.3d 503, 507 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\n      When considering the evidence presented, a reviewing court may also\n\ndetermine whether the trier of fact \u201cgot it wrong\u201d because the verdict the trier of\n\nfact renders is irrational. See Laster v. State, 275 S.W.3d 512, 517 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2009) (a legal sufficiency review \u201cis restricted to guarding against the rare\n\noccurrence when a factfinder does not act rationally.\u201d).       As this Court noted\n\nrecently,\n\n      \u201c...sometimes appellate review of legal sufficiency involves simply\n      construing the reach of the applicable penal provision in order to\n      decide whether the evidence, even when viewed in the light most\n      favorable to conviction, actually establishes a violation of the law.\u201d\n\nDelay v. State, 443 S.W.3d 909, 912-913 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).                Delay\n\nspecifically deals with a situation where the acts that the State alleged did not\n\nconstitute a criminal offense under the totality of circumstances, Id. at 913, but the\n\nconcept is the same: when conducting a legal sufficiency review, a reviewing court\n                                    Page 16 of 30\n\fmay consider whether the evidence support a conviction as a matter of law. A\n\nreviewing court must ask whether there is some evidence that a rational trier of\n\nfact cannot disregard or disbelieve.\n\n      In Brooks, this Court provides a hypothetical in which although the properly\n\nauthenticated surveillance videotape of the event clearly shows that \u201cB\u201d committed\n\nthe robbery, a witness identifies \u201cA\u201d as the robber. Brooks, Id. at 906-907. Though\n\nit is within the trier of fact\u2019s prerogative to believe the witness and disregard the\n\nvideo, based on all of the evidence, the trier of fact\u2019s finding that \u201cA\u201d committed\n\nthe robbery is not a rational finding. Id.\n\n      The same \u201cvideo-trumps-testimony\u201d logic discussed in Brooks should be\n\napplied in cases involving properly authenticated recordings, as is the case before\n\nthis Court. Here, although there is no video of the relevant events, there is a 911\n\nrecording that absolutely rebuts Bolsinger\u2019s testimony.         Weighing the 911\n\nrecording versus Bolsinger\u2019s testimony is not an evaluation of the credibility or\n\ndemeanor of witnesses. The 911 recording came from the government, not from\n\nAppellant, a defense witness, or even an uninterested person.        Therefore, the\n\nreliability and authenticity of the 911 recording cannot be questioned.    And, the\n\n911 recording is the best evidence of Bolsinger\u2019s then-existing mental and\n\nemotional condition. See Tex. Rule Evid. 803(3) (2011). And although the case\n\ndid not involve legal sufficiency, in Carmouche v. State, 10 S.W.3d 323, 332 (Tex.\n\n\n                                       Page 17 of 30\n\fCrim. App. 2000), in describing evidence presented in a videotape versus the\n\ntestimony of an officer, this Court noted,\n\n         \u201cSecond, the nature of the evidence presented in the videotape does\n         not pivot \u2018on an evaluation of credibility and demeanor.\u2019 Rather,\n         the       videotape        presents       indisputable       visual\n         evidence contradicting essential portions of (the officer\u2019s\n         testimony). In these narrow circumstances, we cannot blind\n         ourselves to the videotape evidence simply because (the officer\u2019s)\n         testimony may, by itself, be read to support the Court of Appeals\u2019\n         holding.\u201d\n\n(emphasis added). The language used by this Court in Carmouche follows this\n\nCourt\u2019s conclusions in both Brooks and in Lancon, in which with regards to\n\ncontradictory witness testimony, even when contradicting evidence is compelling,\n\nthe   court    must    give   deference   to   the   fact-finder\u2019s   decision,   unless\n\nthe record clearly reveals an appropriate contrary result. Lancon v. State, 253\n\nS.W.3d 699, 705 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (emphasis added).\n\n         Appellant\u2019s case is one where the jury simply \u201cgot it wrong,\u201d and the record\n\n\u201cclearly reveals an \u201cappropriate contrary result\u201d to the jury\u2019s finding that Appellant\n\ndid not act in self-defense. This Court should thus find that the \u201cvideo-trumps-\n\ntestimony\u201d logic discussed in Brooks should be applied in cases where properly\n\nauthenticated recordings clearly rebut witness testimony, as is the case before this\n\nCourt.\n\n         The only testimonial evidence presented that rebuts Appellant\u2019s testimony\n\nwas that of Bolsinger, as Armstrong did not recall anything after the initial\n                                     Page 18 of 30\n\fconfrontation with Appellant (for instance, Armstrong did not recall even trying to\n\ntake off Appellant\u2019s boots or clothes, RR2, 113). Bolsinger\u2019s testimony is clearly\n\nrebutted by the 911 recording. The 911 recording shows that contrary to his\n\ntestimony, Bolsinger never told the 911 operator that Appellant pointed a gun at\n\nhim (Bolsinger) or demanded keys. (RR2, 295).         Bolsinger did not even know\n\nthat Armstrong had another wound in his back until the 911 operator told Bolsinger\n\nto turn Armstrong on his side if Armstrong vomits or if he has trouble breathing.\n\n(RR2, 191, 288-289; RR7, SX-89). And also contrary to Bolsinger\u2019s testimony,\n\nthe 911 recording clearly shows that Bolsinger never told the operator that he heard\n\na second shot or that he saw Appellant shoot Armstrong a second time. (RR2, 300,\n\n312).\n\n        If Appellant had actually threatened Bolsinger or casually walked up to\n\nArmstrong while Bolsinger was attending to Armstrong and shot Armstrong, the\n\n911 recording would have captured these events. Thus, the reason why the 911\n\nrecording did not capture the events as Bolsinger alleged in court is because\n\nthe events never took place.         When this Court eliminates those parts of\n\nBolsinger\u2019s testimony that are clearly rebutted by the 911 recording, all that is left\n\nthat is relevant to the issue of self-defense is Appellant\u2019s version of the events.\n\nAppellant raised the self-defense claim, and the trial court charged the jury that a\n\nreasonable doubt on the issue requires the jury to acquit the defendant. Tex. Pen.\n\n\n                                    Page 19 of 30\n\fCode \u00a7 2.03(d) (2013). Because Appellant produced this evidence, the State has\n\nthe burden of persuasion to disprove the defense. Zuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589,\n\n594 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). This burden does not require the production of\n\nadditional evidence rebutting self-defense, but rather requires the State to prove its\n\ncase beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.; Saxton, 804 S.W.2d at 912; Luck, 588 S.W.2d\n\nat 375.   The State failed to do so, so this Court should reverse the Judgment of\n\nConviction by Jury and sentence and enter a judgment of acquittal.\n\n\n          iv. In its analysis, the Court of Appeals ignored the evidence from the\n              911 recording\n      When conducting a legal sufficiency review, a reviewing court must\n\nconsider all evidence in the record of the trial, whether it was admissible or\n\ninadmissible. Winfrey, 393 S.W.3d at 767 ; Conner, 67 S.W.3d at 197 ; Powell,\n\n194 S.W.3d at 507 ; Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 740 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1131 (2000). The Court of Appeals failed to consider\n\nthe 911 recording because the court did not even mention the 911 recording.\n\n      As a result, this Court should grant discretionary review because not only\n\nhas the Court of Appeals decided an important question of state and federal law\n\nthat has not been, but should be, settled by this Court, but also because the Court of\n\nAppeals decided an important question of federal law in a way that conflicts with\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 20 of 30\n\fthe applicable decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nSee Tex. Rule App. Proc. 66.3(b) and (c) (2015).\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 21 of 30\n\f   2. Ground for Review Two: The Court of Appeals erred (Issue Two) when\n      it concluded that the evidence is legally sufficient to prove that\n      Appellant committed Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon by\n      Threat because: (1) the jury was not free to disregard the 911 recording\n      in which a witness was heard by the jury, who during trial provided\n      materially conflicting testimony; and (2) in its analysis, the Court of\n      Appeals ignored the evidence from the 911 recording.\n      Appellant incorporates all arguments from Ground One above into this\n\nground and argues that the Court of Appeals erred (Issue Two) when it concluded\n\nthat the evidence is legally sufficient to prove that Appellant committed\n\nAggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon by Threat because: (1) the jury was not\n\nfree to disregard the 911 recording in which a witness was heard by the jury, who\n\nduring trial provided materially conflicting testimony; and (2) in its analysis, the\n\nCourt of Appeals ignored the evidence from the 911 recording. There is no\n\nindication in the 911 recording that Appellant pointed a gun at Bolsinger and\n\nthreatened him unless Bolsinger gave Appellant his keys. Bolsinger\u2019s demeanor\n\nduring the entire 911 call was one of concern for Armstrong, not fear of Appellant.\n\nBolsinger even told the 911 operator that the shooting was an accidental discharge,\n\nwhich is corroborated with what Bolsinger told an investigator immediately after\n\nthe incident. (RR2, 184, 283, 284, 286, 310, 311; RR3, 216; RR7, SX-89). The\n\ntime frame in which Appellant would have pointed a gun at Bolsinger and\n\ndemanded Appellant\u2019s keys occurred within the time frame of the 911 call, and at\n\nno point during the 911 call did Bolsinger hint or state that Appellant pointed his\n\n\n                                    Page 22 of 30\n\fgun at him and demanded his keys. (RR2, 295).\n\n      Under the standards provided above, and the same \u201cvideo-trumps-\n\ntestimony\u201d logic discussed in Brooks, the 911 recording absolutely rebuts\n\nBolsinger\u2019s testimony, and weighing the 911 recording versus Bolsinger\u2019s in-court\n\ntestimony is not an evaluation of the credibility or demeanor between the\n\ntestimony of two witnesses. See Brooks , 323 S.W.3d at 912; Jackson v. Virginia,\n\n443 U.S. at 319; Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778; Saxton, 804 S.W.2d at 912. And as\n\nargued above, the 911 recording is the best evidence of Bolsinger\u2019s then-existing\n\nmental and emotional condition. See Tex. Rule Evid. 803(3) (2011).\n\n      Further, the Court of Appeals ignored the 911 call.       When conducting\n\na legal sufficiency review, a reviewing court must consider all evidence in the\n\nrecord of the trial, whether it was admissible or inadmissible. Winfrey, 393 S.W.3d\n\nat 767; Conner, 67 S.W.3d at 197; Powell, 194 S.W.3d at 507; Dewberry, 4\n\nS.W.3d at 740. The Court of Appeals failed to consider the 911 recording because\n\nthe court did not even mention the 911 recording.\n\n      As a result, this Court should grant discretionary review. See Tex. Rule App.\n\nProc. 66.3(b) and (c) (2015).\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 23 of 30\n\f   3. Ground for Review Three: The Court of Appeals erred (Issues Three\n      and Four) when it concluded that Appellant waived the issues of\n      Smithson testifying in violation of Appellant\u2019s constitutional rights to\n      confrontation when in violation of its own Standard Discovery Order,\n      the trial court abused its discretion and allowed Smithson to testify as\n      an expert. Appellant\u2019s objections were clearly objections under the\n      confrontation clause.\n       In combining Issues Three and Four of the Appellant\u2019s Brief, the Court of\n\nAppeals concluded that \u201c[B]ecause Appellant did not object at trial to testimony by\n\neither Smithson or Frisbie based on any denial of any statutory or constitutional\n\nright to confrontation, Appellant waived these issues on appeal.\u201d Johnson, Id. at\n\n*10. Issues Three and Four of the Appellant\u2019s Brief were properly preserved for\n\nappellate review. This Court has rejected the hypertechnical requirements for error\n\npreservation that the Court of Appeals imposed on Appellant. As this Court held\n\nin Everitt v. State:\n\n   \u201cTo preserve an issue for appellate review, a complainant must have made a\n   timely and specific objection, and the trial court must have ruled on the\n   objection either expressly or implicitly\u2026The objection must be specific\n   enough \u201cto make the trial court aware of the complaint.\u201d Rejecting\n   hypertechnical requirements for preservation, we have held that \u201call the\n   party has to do to avoid the forfeiture of a complaint on appeal is to let\n   the trial judge know what he wants, why he thinks he is entitled to it,\n   and to do so clearly enough for the judge to understand him at a time\n   when the trial court is in a proper position to do something about\n   it.\u201d Layton v. State, 280 S.W.3d 235, 239 (Tex. Crim. App.\n   2009) (quoting Lankston v. State, 827 S.W.2d 907, 909 (Tex. Crim. App.\n   1992); see also Archie v. State, 221 S.W.3d 695, 698 (Tex. Crim. App.\n   2007) (\u201c[W]e will not be hyper-technical in examination of whether error\n   was preserved.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                   Page 24 of 30\n\fEveritt v. State, 407 S.W.3d 259, 263 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (emphasis added). In\n\nthe case before this Court, Appellant made several objections that that were more\n\nthan \u201cspecific enough to make the trial court aware of the complaint,\u201d which was\n\nto let the trial court know that Appellant was making a confrontation clause\n\nobjection under Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), Melendez-Diaz v.\n\nMassachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 131 S. Ct.\n\n2705 (2011). Merely because Appellant did not cite these cases when making his\n\nobjections does not mean that the issues were not preserved for appellate review.\n\n      For instance, Appellant made the following objections to Smithson\u2019s\n\ntestimony: when asked whether there had \u201cbeen some type of medical procedures\n\nalready done before (Armstrong) reached the hospital,\u201d Appellant objected as to\n\nSmithson\u2019s personal knowledge, and the trial court overruled this objection. (RR3,\n\n13). Smithson then responded, \u201c[T]he records reflect that he did have a tube\n\nplaced in his windpipe to protect his airway. There also was a notification of a\n\ngunshot wound to the face and that there was a gunshot wound to the back.\u201d (RR3,\n\n13) (emphasis added).     This clearly shows that Smithson was testifying to a\n\ndocument prepared by another person. Then when asked whether he took or\n\nsupervised the taking of an X-ray or CAT scan, he answered \u201cPersonally, I did\n\nnot.\u201d (RR3, 26). Finally, Appellant objected, \u201cI\u2019m going to object to this witness\n\ntestifying about any -- any issue that deals with his expertise, knowledge and\n\n\n                                   Page 25 of 30\n\ftraining and what he actually did rather than what he observed.\u201d (RR3, 29)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      The Confrontation Clause as cited by Appellant in his Brief under Crawford\n\nv. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004) provides a defendant the right to confront the\n\nwitnesses against him. U.S. Const. Amend. VI; see Burch v. State, 401 S.W.3d\n\n634, 636-640 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Testimonial evidence is inadmissible unless\n\n(1) the witness appears at trial and is cross-examined or (2) the witness is\n\nunavailable and the defense had an opportunity to cross-examine. Burch, 401\n\nS.W.3d at 636. And, testimonial statements are those \u201cthat were made under\n\ncircumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the\n\nstatement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d Id., citing Crawford, 541 U.S.\n\nat 52 and Melendez-Diaz, Id. at 310. Reports such as those testified to by the State\n\nexperts are considered testimonial statements. See Bullcoming, Id. at 2710 and\n\nBurch, Id. at 636-637.\n\n      This Court should find error in the conclusions of the Court of Appeals in\n\nwhich the court imposed \u201chypertechnical requirements for preservation.\u201d          As a\n\nresult, this Court should grant discretionary review. See Tex. Rule App. Proc.\n\n66.3(c) (2015).\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 26 of 30\n\f   4. Ground for Review Four: The Court of Appeals erred (Issues Three,\n      Four, and Five) when it ruled that although the trial court failed to\n      follow its own standard discovery order by allowing Smithson and\n      Frisbie to testify as experts, \u201cthe trial court did not engage in any\n      judicial impropriety by simply ruling on the admissibility of evidence.\u201d\n      This was not merely an issue regarding the admissibility of evidence.\n      This issue is about evidence being willfully withheld from disclosure\n      under a discovery order, and evidence that should have been excluded\n      as this Court ruled in Oprean v. State, 201 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. Crim. App.\n      2006).\n      The Court of Appeals found that \u201cthe trial court did not engage in any\n\njudicial impropriety by simply ruling on the admissibility of evidence.\u201d Johnson,\n\nId. at 11-12. However, this was not merely an issue regarding the admissibility of\n\nevidence. This issue is about evidence being willfully withheld from disclosure\n\nunder a discovery order, and evidence that should have been excluded as this Court\n\nruled in Oprean v. State, 201 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). In Oprean, this\n\nCourt held that evidence willfully withheld from disclosure under a discovery\n\norder should be excluded. See Oprean, 201 S.W.3d at 726 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006);\n\nciting Hollowell v. State, 571 S.W.2d 179, 180 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978).            In\n\nOprean, in violation of its own pretrial order, the trial court allowed into evidence\n\nthat was not disclosed until minutes before the penalty phase of the trial began. Id.\n\nat 725. This Court reversed and remanded the case back to the court of appeals to\n\ndetermine what harm was caused by the trial court\u2019s failure to follow its own order.\n\nId. at 728. The court of appeals found that the admission of the evidence \u201chad a\n\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict, and\n\n                                    Page 27 of 30\n\freversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for a new punishment\n\nhearing. See Oprean v. State, 238 S.W.3d 412, 416 (Tex. App. Houston [1st Dist]\n\n2007), pet. ref.).\n\n       In the case before this court, the fact that the State intended to use both\n\nSmithson and Frisbie as experts was willfully withheld from Appellant. As a\n\nresult, this Court should grant discretionary review. See Tex. Rule App. Proc.\n\n66.3(a), (b), and (c) (2015).\n\n\nIX. Conclusion and Prayer\n\n       For the reasons stated in this petition, Appellant respectfully prays that this\n\nCourt grant discretionary review, reverse the judgments of conviction and\n\nsentences and enter a judgment of acquittal. In the alternative, Appellant prays that\n\nthis Court of Appeals reverse the judgments of conviction and sentences and\n\nremand this case back to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       Michael Mowla\n                                       445 E.

Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a7 9.32(a) because defendant walked up to the alleged victim after the first shot and shot him\na second time in the back while he lay on the floor; [2]-Evidence was sufficient to prove defendant\ncommitted aggravated assault under \u00a7\u00a7 22.01(a)(2), 22.02(a)(2) (2011) with a deadly weapon because\nthe alleged victim testified that, after shooting the first alleged victim in the back, defendant pointed\nthe handgun at him and demanded his truck keys; [3]-Defendant was not entitled to an instruction\nunder Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 8.04(a), (b) (2011) because despite evidence showing that he was\nintoxicated, there was no evidence showing that he did not know that his conduct was wrong.\n\nOutcome\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nLexisNexis\u00ae Headnotes\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Assault & Battery > Aggravated Offenses > Elements\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Criminal Offenses > Weapons Offenses > Definitions\n\f                                      2014 Tex.

Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 22.01(a)(1),\n22.02(a)(2) (2011), the State is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\nintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to a victim while using or exhibiting a\ndeadly weapon. The deadly weapon includes a firearm. Tex.

Penal Code\nAnn. \u00a7 9.32(a) and he or she is required to bring forward some evidence to support a defense. Once\nthe defendant produces that evidence, the State has a burden of persuasion to disprove the defense. This\nburden does not require the production of additional evidence rebutting self-defense, but it does require\nthe State to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Self-defense is an issue of fact to be determined\nby a jury, and when a trier of fact finds the defendant guilty, there is an implicit finding that the jury\nrejects the defendant\u2019s self-defense theory.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Defenses > Self-Defense\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Standards of Review > Substantial Evidence > Sufficiency of Evidence\n  Evidence > Burdens of Proof > Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt\n  Evidence > Types of Evidence > Circumstantial Evidence\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Criminal Offenses > General Overview\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Defenses > Self-Defense\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Standards of Review > Substantial Evidence > Sufficiency of Evidence\n  Evidence > Burdens of Proof > Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt\n  Evidence > Types of Evidence > Circumstantial Evidence\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Criminal Offenses > General Overview\n\nHN3 When an appellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support rejection of a\ndefense such as self-defense under Tex.

Rather, an appellate court\nexamines all of the evidence in a light most favorable to a verdict to determine whether any rational\ntrier of fact can find beyond a reasonable doubt (1) the essential elements of an alleged offense and\n(2) against the appellant on a self-defense issue. In its review, the appellate court evaluates all of the\nevidence in a record, both direct and circumstantial, whether admissible or inadmissible.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Juries & Jurors > Province of Court & Jury > Credibility of Witnesses\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Juries & Jurors > Province of Court & Jury > Weight of Evidence\n  Evidence > ... > Testimony > Credibility of Witnesses > General Overview\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Juries & Jurors > Province of Court & Jury > Credibility of Witnesses\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Juries & Jurors > Province of Court & Jury > Weight of Evidence\n  Evidence > ... > Testimony > Credibility of Witnesses > General Overview\n\nHN4 A jury is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and weight to be given to their testimony.\nAs fact finder, the jury is entitled to judge the credibility of witnesses, and can choose to believe all,\nsome, or none of the testimony presented by the parties.\n\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Assault & Battery > Aggravated Offenses > Elements\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Trials > Burdens of Proof > Prosecution\n  Evidence > Burdens of Proof > Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Assault & Battery > Aggravated Offenses > Elements\n  Criminal Law & Procedure > Trials > Burdens of Proof > Prosecution\n  Evidence > Burdens of Proof > Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt\n\nHN5 To obtain a conviction for aggravated assault under Tex.

Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 8.04(a) (2011). Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to the commission of\na crime; but evidence of temporary insanity caused by intoxication may be introduced by an actor in\n\n                                                 Page 5 of 12\n\f                                              2014 Tex.

In other words, unlike the defense of insanity which\nwill bar a conviction of the crime, evidence of temporary insanity caused by intoxication can be used\nby a jury to lessen a punishment.\n\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Departures From Guidelines > Downward Departures > Diminished\n    Capacity\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Jury Instructions > Particular Instructions > Theory of Defense\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > Defenses > Insanity > Insanity Defense\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > Defenses > Intoxication\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > Trials > Burdens of Proof > Defense\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Departures From Guidelines > Downward Departures > Diminished\n    Capacity\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > ... > Jury Instructions > Particular Instructions > Theory of Defense\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > Defenses > Insanity > Insanity Defense\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > Defenses > Intoxication\n    Criminal Law & Procedure > Trials > Burdens of Proof > Defense\n\nHN15 Like an affirmative defense of insanity and any other defensive issue, whether a defendant is\nentitled to a mitigation instruction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 8.04(b) depends on whether an issue\nis raised by the evidence. Before it is necessary for a trial court to affirmatively instruct a jury on\nvoluntary intoxication as mitigating evidence at a punishment stage of a trial, the defendant must\nestablish that he or she is intoxicated and that intoxication renders him or her temporarily \u2033insane,\u2033 i.e.,\nthe defendant must establish that his or her voluntary intoxication causes him or her to not know his\nor her conduct is wrong. He or she must do more than merely present evidence of intoxication or even\ngross intoxication. He or she must show that either intoxication makes him or her unaware that what\nhe or she is doing is wrong, or it makes him or her incapable of conforming his or her conduct to the\nlaw.\n\nJudges: Before QUINN, C.J., and HANCOCK and PIRTLE, JJ.\n\nOpinion by: Patrick A. Pirtle\n\nOpinion\nAppellant, Justin Davis Johnson, was convicted by a jury of aggravated assault causing serious bodily\ninjury with a deadly weapon, a firearm, and aggravated assault by threat with a deadly weapon, a\nfirearm.1 He was sentenced to twelve years and six years confinement, respectively, with the two\nsentences to be served concurrently. On appeal, Appellant asserts the evidence was legally insufficient\n(1) to prove he was not justified in using deadly force against the victim of the first offense and (2)\nto prove he committed aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against the victim of the second\noffense. He also asserts the trial court erred by permitting two witnesses, (3) Smithson and (4) Frisbie,\n1\n    See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 22.01, 22.02 (West 2011).\n\n                                                            Page 6 of 12\n\f                                                  2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520, *1\n\n\n\nto testify as experts, and (5), in so doing, failed to act as a neutral and impartial judge, and (6) also erred\nby denying a voluntary intoxication instruction in the punishment charge. We affirm.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nOn December 27, 2011, Appellant and Kent Bolsinger arrived at [*2] a hunting lease located in Hood\nCounty, Texas. Ryan Armstrong, whom Appellant had never previously met, shared the hunting cabin\non the lease with the two other men. After dinner on the 28th, Appellant was outside the cabin firing\nrounds into a fire pit. Armstrong and Appellant, both of whom had been drinking, exchanged words\nconcerning this particular conduct. When Appellant protested and started to leave, Armstrong and\nBolsinger prevented him from doing so due to his state of intoxication. Bolsinger took Appellant\u2019s keys\nand Armstrong \u2033escorted\u2033 him to a bunk room in the cabin, pushed him onto a sofa and told him to\n\u2033sleep it off.\u2033 When Armstrong turned and reached the doorway, Appellant shot him with a .380\nsemi-automatic handgun, once in the jaw and once in the back.2 After Bolsinger went to assist\nArmstrong, Appellant pointed his handgun at him and asked for the keys to his vehicle. Bolsinger did\nnot give Appellant his keys but instead summoned medical assistance.\n\nIn March 2012, Appellant was indicted for two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, to\nwit: a firearm. Count one alleged that on or about December 28, 2011, Appellant intentionally,\nknowingly, or recklessly caused \u2033serious bodily injury to [Armstrong] by shooting him with a firearm\n. . . .\u2033 Count two alleged that, on or about the same date, Appellant intentionally or knowingly\nthreatened \u2033imminent bodily injury to [Bolsinger]\u2033 and did then and there use or exhibit a deadly\nweapon, to wit: a firearm.\n\nFollowing a five-day jury trial, Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the trial court issued\ntwo judgments sentencing Appellant to twelve years on count one and six years on count two, with the\ntwo sentences to be served concurrently. This appeal followed.\n\nISSUE [*4] ONE: SELF-DEFENSE\n\nAppellant asserts there was legally insufficient evidence at trial to establish he was not justified in\nusing deadly force against Armstrong. In support, he contends he was justified in shooting Armstrong\nbecause he was in fear of death or imminent bodily injury. At the time of the incident, both men had\nbeen drinking heavily. Appellant testified at trial that, prior to the shooting, Armstrong had punched,\nkicked and choked him. Appellant also produced character witnesses to testify he was normally a\npeaceful, law-abiding person.\n\nHN1 To obtain a conviction for aggravated assault under count one of the indictment, the State was\nrequired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly\ncaused bodily injury to Armstrong while using or exhibiting a deadly weapon. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN.\n\u00a7\u00a7 22.01(a)(1), 22.02(a)(2) (West 2011). A deadly weapon includes a firearm. See id. \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(A).\n2\n    Not surprisingly, Appellant\u2019s version of the events differs somewhat from that testified to by Armstrong and Bolsinger. According\nto Appellant, Armstrong knocked him to the ground, slammed him face-first into his vehicle, [*3] threw him into a fence and then\nforcibly escorted him into the sleeping area of the cabin, where he started hitting Appellant in the head. Appellant further testified that\nArmstrong placed his hands around Appellant\u2019s neck and screamed, \u2033I\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u2033 Appellant testified that, fearing for\nhis life, he shot Armstrong two times, once in the jaw causing him to spin around and then once in the back.\n\n                                                                Page 7 of 12\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520, *4\n\n\n\nIt is undisputed that Appellant used deadly force and intended to shoot Armstrong twice with a\nsemi-automatic handgun. Appellant asserts, however, he was justified in using deadly force because he\nreasonably believed deadly force was immediately necessary to protect him against Armstrong\u2019s [*5]\nuse or attempted use of unlawful deadly force. See id. \u00a7 9.32 (a).\n\nHN2 Appellant had the initial burden of production on the issue of self-defense and he was required\nto bring forward some evidence to support the defense. Zuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589, 594 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2003). Once he produced that evidence, the State had the burden of persuasion to disprove the\ndefense. Id. This burden does not require the production of additional evidence rebutting self-defense,\nbut it does require the State to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. Self-defense is an issue\nof fact to be determined by the jury, London v. State, 325 S.W.3d 197, 202 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2008,\npet. ref\u2019d), and when, as here, the trier of fact finds the defendant guilty, there is an implicit finding\nthat the jury rejected the defendant\u2019s self-defense theory. Saxton v. State, 804 S.W.2d 910, 914 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1991).\n\nHN3 When an appellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support rejection of a\ndefense such as self-defense, the question is not whether the State presented evidence which refuted\nappellant\u2019s self-defense evidence. Saxton, 804 S.W.2d at 914. Rather, we examine all of the evidence\nin a light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found\nbeyond a reasonable doubt (1) the essential elements of the alleged offense and (2) against appellant\non the self-defense issue. [*6] Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 912 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (citing\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)). See Saxton, 804 S.W.2d\nat 914. In our review, we evaluate all of the evidence in the record, both direct and circumstantial,\nwhether admissible or inadmissible. Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 740 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), cert.\ndenied, 529 U.S. 1131, 120 S. Ct. 2008, 146 L. Ed. 2d 958 (2000).\nThe jury\u2019s decision to reject Appellant\u2019s defensive claims ultimately hinges on the credibility of\nwitnesses. Armstrong testified he grabbed Appellant by the back of his neck and escorted him to the\ncabin\u2014not \u2033an aggressive grab, it was more of a guide.\u2033 He then shoved Appellant into the corner of\nthe bunk room where the sofa was located. Bolsinger testified that, before Appellant shot Armstrong,\nArmstrong was helping Appellant up the cabin\u2019s front porch stairs with one hand on the side of his\nshoulder, one hand kind of on Appellant\u2019s waist and back\u2014\u2033kind of helping guide him into the cabin.\u2033\nBolsinger testified he did not observe any violence and did not hear any physical altercation prior to\nthe shooting. Bolsinger also testified that it was not until Armstrong was standing on the threshold of\nthe doorway between the cabin\u2019s living room and bunk room that Armstrong was first shot by\nAppellant. Appellant then walked over to where Armstrong was lying and shot him a second time in\nthe back. Contrary to the testimony of Armstrong [*7] and Bolsinger, Appellant testified that, prior to\nshooting Armstrong, he had been kicked, beaten, choked and thrown about the cabin by Armstrong. He\ntestified he reacted by rapidly firing two shots.\n\nHN4 The jury is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and weight to be given to their testimony.\nGolden Eagle Archery v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). As fact finder, the jury\nis entitled to judge the credibility of witnesses, and can choose to believe all, some, or none of the\ntestimony presented by the parties. Chambers v. State, 805 S.W.2d 459, 461 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st\nDist.] 2006, pet. ref\u2019d). The statements of Appellant and his witnesses do not conclusively prove a\nclaim of self-defense. See London, 325 S.W.3d at 203; Denman v. State, 193 S.W.3d 129, 132-33 (Tex.\n                                                Page 8 of 12\n\f                                     2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520, *7\n\n\n\nApp.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. ref\u2019d) (finding evidence sufficient to support conviction of\naggravated assault under Jackson v. Virginia despite defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, which was\nbased on testimony of defendant and other witnesses who stated complainant had assaulted or\nthreatened defendant on prior occasions). Further, that Appellant walked up to Armstrong after the first\nshot and shot Armstrong a second time in the back while he lay on the floor, if believed by the jury,\nis evidence negating his claim of self-defense. See Kirk v. State, 421 S.W.3d 772, 781 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort\nWorth 2014, pet. ref\u2019d); Smith v. State, 355 S.W.3d 138, 146-47 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2011,\npet. ref\u2019d).\nBased on the testimony of Bolsinger and Armstrong coupled with Appellant\u2019s conduct subsequent to\nthe first shot, the jury [*8] could have reasonably concluded that Appellant\u2019s conduct was inconsistent\nwith his self-defensive claims. See Cleveland v. State, 177 S.W.3d 374, 380-81 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2005, pet. ref\u2019d), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1073, 126 S. Ct. 1774, 164 L. Ed. 2d 523 (2006)\n(finding that jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant\u2019s conduct in continuing to stab his\nwife\u2019s back as she lay bleeding on floor was inconsistent with his claim of self-defense). Having\nconsidered the entire record, we conclude the jury rationally could have found each element of the\ncharged offense was proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that it could have rationally rejected\nAppellant\u2019s claim of self-defense. See Zuliani, 97 S.W.3d at 594. Accordingly, we hold the evidence\nwas sufficient to support Appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault against Armstrong. Appellant\u2019s\nfirst issue is overruled.\n\nISSUE TWO: AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON\nAppellant asserts no rational trier of fact would have found him guilty of pointing a gun at Bolsinger\nand threatening to shoot him if he didn\u2019t give Appellant his truck keys. He asserts inconsistencies in\nBolsinger\u2019s account of what occurred that night called his credibility into question and the jury should\nhave believed him rather than Bolsinger.\n\nHN5 To obtain a conviction for aggravated assault under count two of the indictment, [*9] the State\nwas required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant intentionally or knowingly threatened\nBolsinger with imminent bodily injury while using or exhibiting a deadly weapon. See TEX. PENAL CODE\nANN. \u00a7\u00a7 22.01(a)(2), 22.02(a)(2) (West 2011). Because the standard of review for legal sufficiency set\nforth in our discussion of issue one applies equally here, we will not restate it.\nAppellant\u2019s second issue also presents a credibility question decided by the jury. Considering the\nevidence in a light most favorable to the verdict, Bolsinger testified that, after shooting Armstrong in\nthe back, Appellant pointed the handgun at him and demanded his truck keys. Appellant denied the\nthreat to Bolsinger took place. HN6 The jury is the sole judge of the witnesses\u2019 credibility and weight\nto be given their testimony. See Golden Eagle Archery, 116 S.W.3d at 761. Further, while there may\nhave appeared to be inconsistencies in Bolsinger\u2019s testimony regarding what occurred that night, those\ninconsistencies do not render the evidence insufficient to support a conviction, see Cooks v. State, 844\nS.W.2d 697, 708 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992), and we reject Appellant\u2019s argument that credibility issues\namong the State\u2019s witnesses render the evidence insufficient. Bolsinger\u2019s testimony alone is sufficient\nto convict Appellant. [*10] See Anderson v. State, 11 S.W.3d 369, 375-76 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st\nDist.] 2000, pet. ref\u2019d). Appellant\u2019s second issue is overruled.\n\nISSUES THREE, FOUR AND FIVE: RIGHT TO CONFRONTATION AND IMPARTIAL JUDGE\n\n                                                Page 9 of 12\n\f                                      2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520, *10\n\n\n\nIn issues three and four, Appellant asserts the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Dr. John\nSmithson and Sonny Frisbie to testify as expert witnesses. In support, Appellant contends the trial court\nviolated his statutory and constitutional rights to confrontation as well as his First and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights under the United States Constitution by permitting them to testify at trial. In his fifth\nissue, Appellant asserts he was denied a trial before a fair and impartial judge because the trial judge\nerroneously permitted Smithson and Frisbie to give expert testimony.\n\nRIGHT TO CONFRONTATION\n\nHN7 Because Appellant did not object at trial to testimony by either Smithson or Frisbie based on any\ndenial of any statutory or constitutional right to confrontation, Appellant waived these issues on appeal.\nSee Clark v. State, 365 S.W.3d 333, 339 n.1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). See also Wright v. State, 28 S.W.3d\n526, 536 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1128, 121 S. Ct. 885, 148 L. Ed. 2d 793 (2001)\n(HN8 defendants waive their rights to confrontation by failing to object to the admission of certain\nevidence at trial). The issue on appeal must comport with the objection made at trial. See Clark, 365\nS.W.3d at 339 (citing Thomas v. State, 723 S.W.2d 696, 700 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)).\n\nFAIR AND IMPARTIAL JUDGE\n\nAppellant next asserts he was denied [*11] a trial before a fair and impartial judge because the trial\njudge permitted Smithson to testify to the presence of foreign bodies in CAT scan and x-ray images\nand read Dr. Ashley Johnson\u2019s report from Armstrong\u2019s medical records. He also asserts his rights were\nviolated when the trial court permitted Frisbie to testify about test-firing rounds from the handgun used\nby Appellant to shoot Armstrong. We disagree.\n\nHN9 Due process requires a neutral and detached judge. Brumit v. State, 206 S.W.3d 639, 645 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2006). A judge should not act as an advocate or adversary for any party. Dockstader v.\nState, 233 S.W.3d 98, 108 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. ref\u2019d). HN10 To reverse a\njudgment on the ground of improper conduct or comments of the judge, we must find (1) that judicial\nimpropriety was in fact committed and (2) probable prejudice to the complaining party. Id. HN11 \u2033In\nruling upon the admissibility of evidence, the judge shall not discuss or comment upon the weight of\nthe same or its bearing in the case, but shall simply decide whether or not it is admissible; nor shall\nhe, at any stage of the proceeding previous to the return of the verdict, make any remark calculated to\nconvey to the jury his opinion of the case.\u2033 TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.05 (West 1979).\n\nWe find that the trial court did not engage in any judicial impropriety [*12] by simply ruling on the\nadmissibility of evidence. Pursuant to article 38.05 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial\ncourt decided whether the evidence was admissible and made no statement \u2033upon the weight of the\nsame or its bearing in the case.\u2033 Id. As regards Smithson reading Ashley\u2019s report, Appellant had agreed\nto admit Armstrong\u2019s medical records including Ashley\u2019s report without objection in open court.\nFurthermore, Frisbie testified as a fact witness who described test-firing the handgun and the direction\nthe shell casings were ejected from the gun. As such, he was merely testifying as a fact witness\nconcerning his personal observations and he did not express any opinion or testify to any conclusions\nfrom those facts.\nAssuming, without deciding, the trial court erred in allowing Smith to comment on CAT scan and x-ray\nimages, whether there was fundamental error depends on whether Appellant can establish egregious\n\n                                                Page 10 of 12\n\f                                               2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520, *12\n\n\n\nharm. See Powell v. State, 252 S.W.3d 742, 744 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.);\nMoreno v. State, 900 S.W.2d 357, 359 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 1995, no pet.) (citing Brewer v. State, 572\nS.W.2d 719, 721 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1978)).3 HN12 A trial court\u2019s comments do not\nconstitute fundamental error unless they rise to such a level as to bear on the presumption of innocence\nor vitiate the impartiality of the jury. Jasper v. State, 61 S.W.3d 413, 421 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Here,\nthe admission of Smithson\u2019s testimony related to the Ashley report and Frisbie\u2019s testimony were not\nreversible [*13] error.\nFurthermore, Smithson\u2019s testimony described CAT scan and x-ray images that were visible\nrepresentations of two bullets, one in Armstrong\u2019s neck and another near his spine giving some\nindication of the possible direction from which the bullets entered his body\u2014all of which had been\ntestified to by numerous other witnesses without objection. The similar testimony from other witnesses\nmitigates against the harmfulness of any error as does the overwhelming evidence of Appellant\u2019s\nguilt\u2014eyewitness testimony of Armstrong and Bolsinger coupled with other corroborating evidence,\ni.e., testimony that a spent shell casing was found in the bunk room coupled with Frisbie\u2019s testimony\nregarding the direction spent shell casings were ejected from the handgun, Frisbie\u2019s testimony\ndescribing the location and amount of blood stains in the bunk room resulting from the shooting,\nphotographs [*14] showing the cabin\u2019s living room furniture was undisturbed, EMS paramedic Jody\nAlvey-Fries\u2019s testimony indicating that, at the cabin, Appellant evidenced only a superficial wound to\nhis ear that was not fresh, Bolsinger\u2019s testimony that Appellant\u2019s abrasion on his ear resulted from an\naccident chopping wood earlier that day, and Investigator Patrick Felan\u2019s testimony that he collected\nbullet fragments from Armstrong\u2019s neck and back. See Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 258 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1999), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1070, 119 S. Ct. 1466, 143 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1999).\nGiven the strength of the State\u2019s case and the presence of other testimony concerning the locations\nwhere Armstrong was shot and the direction the bullets were traveling when they struck Armstrong,\nwe find beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of Smithson\u2019s testimony regarding CAT scan and\nx-ray images did not contribute or affect the very basis of the case or vitally affect Appellant\u2019s\njustification theory of self-defense. See Cosio v. State, 353 S.W.3d 766, 777 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). See\nalso TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(a). Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s third, fourth and fifth issues.\n\nISSUE SIX\u2014VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION INSTRUCTION\nFinally, Appellant asserts the trial court erred when it denied him a voluntary intoxication instruction\nat the end of the penalty phase of the trial. He asserts that [*15] shooting Armstrong was so out of\ncharacter for him that the trial court should have concluded that he did not know his conduct was\nwrong. In support, he points to his mental state of gross intoxication and character witnesses who\ntestified to his peaceful, law-abiding character.\n\nHN14 Insanity is an affirmative defense to prosecution that, at the time of the conduct charged, the\nactor, as a result of severe mental disease or defect, did not know that his conduct was wrong. TEX.\nPENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 8.04(a) (West 2011). Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to the commission of\na crime; but evidence of temporary insanity caused by intoxication and may be introduced by the actor\n3\n   Appellant made no objection at trial based on the First or Fourteenth Amendments because of a denial of his rights to a fair and\nimpartial judge or trial. HN13 When no objection is made, \u2033remarks and conduct of the court may not be subsequently challenged unless\nthey are fundamentally erroneous\u2014that is, the error creates egregious harm.\u2033 See Powell v. State, 252 S.W.3d at 744-45.\n\n                                                            Page 11 of 12\n\f                                     2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 12520, *15\n\n\n\nin mitigation of his punishment. Id. at (a), (b). In other words, unlike the defense of insanity which\nwould bar the conviction of a crime, evidence of temporary insanity caused by intoxication could be\nused by a jury to lessen the punishment.\n\nHN15 Like the affirmative defense of insanity and any other defensive issue, whether a defendant is\nentitled to a mitigation instruction under section 8.04(b) depends on whether the issue is raised by the\nevidence. Arabie v. State, 421 S.W.3d 111, 114 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2013, pet. ref\u2019d). Before it is\nnecessary for the trial court to affirmatively instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication [*16] as\nmitigating evidence at the punishment stage of the trial, the defendant must establish that he was\nintoxicated and that intoxication rendered him temporarily \u2033insane,\u2033 Arnold v. State, 742 S.W.2d 10, 14\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1987), i.e., the defendant must establish that his voluntary intoxication caused him to\nnot know his conduct was wrong. Mendenhall v. State, 77 S.W.3d 815, 817-18 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\nHe must do more than merely present evidence of intoxication or even gross intoxication. Arnold, 742\nS.W.2d at 14. He must show that either intoxication made him unaware that what he was doing was\nwrong, or it made him incapable of conforming his conduct to the law. See Cordova v. State, 733\nS.W.2d 175, 190 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).\n\nHere, Appellant\u2019s primary defense in the trial court was self-defense. He testified he had a clear\nrecollection of the crime and claimed he was only doing what was necessary to defend himself against\nan attack by Armstrong. He gave a detailed step-by-step account of what occurred the night of the\nincident and what he was thinking and feeling at the time the crime was committed. His character\nwitnesses described Appellant as a law-abiding man who knew right from wrong.\n\nDespite evidence showing Appellant was intoxicated, there is no evidence tending to show that he did\nnot know that his conduct was wrong. See Cordova, 733 S.W.2d at 190 (evidence that defendant was\n\u2033crazy drunk\u2033 insufficient [*17] to show temporary insanity). Because he failed to present evidence of\ntemporary insanity, he was not entitled to a mitigating instruction on insanity by intoxication during\nthe punishment phase, Meine v. State, 356 S.W.3d 605, 611 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 2011, pet.\nref\u2019d), and we find the trial court did not err in refusing to submit an instruction on voluntary\nintoxication. Rainey v. State, 949 S.W.2d 537, 543 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 1997, pet. ref\u2019d), cert. denied,\n525 U.S. 880, 119 S. Ct. 186, 142 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1998). Appellant\u2019s sixth issue is overruled.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\nPatrick A.
