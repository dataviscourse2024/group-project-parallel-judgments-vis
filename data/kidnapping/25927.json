WYRICK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n        D.K. was sixteen years old in 1985, and lived with her mother in a Charlotte\n\napartment. On September 6, 1985, while D.K.\u2019s mother was out of town, D.N., who\n\nwas fifteen years old at the time, stayed in the apartment with D.K. At 4:30 a.m.,\n\nthey were awakened when the doorbell rang. They spoke with a man named \u201cTony\u201d\n\nthrough the door, who claimed to be looking for the property manager\u2019s apartment.\n\nTony left when the girls told him he had the wrong apartment.\n\n        The girls were awakened again at 7:30 a.m. to D.K.\u2019s dog barking and a man\n\nentering the room with a crowbar. He removed their clothing, tied their hands, and\n\nplaced pillowcases over their heads. The man was later identified as Defendant.\n\nDefendant fondled the girls and inserted his fingers into their vaginas. He began\n\nhaving sexual intercourse with D.K, then forced her to perform oral sex on him,\n\nthreatening to hurt D.N. if she refused. Defendant ejaculated into D.K.\u2019s mouth and\n\nwiped her face off with a pillowcase. Subsequently, he had sexual intercourse with\n\nD.N.\n\n        Defendant apologized to the girls and left the room. D.K. heard Defendant\n\nwalk downstairs and exit through a sliding glass door. After he left, D.K. managed\n\nto get her hands free, but could not free D.N. D.K. called her brother, who came to\n\nthe apartment and used a knife to free D.N.\u2019s hands. The police were called at that\n\ntime.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                  STATE V. WYRICK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      D.K. and D.N. submitted to a sexual assault examination by Dr. Carey Ziemer\n\nat Charlotte Memorial Hospital. Dr. Ziemer determined that the results of D.K.\u2019s\n\nexamination was consistent with the information she had provided. For D.N., Dr.\n\nZiemer observed a laceration to the base of her vulva that was still bleeding. Dr.\n\nZiemer believed this injury occurred during a recent struggle. With the aid of a\n\npediatric speculum, Dr. Ziemer observed that D.N.\u2019s vagina had a whitish mucoid\n\nfluid with a reddish tinge. Dr. Ziemer collected additional evidence from the girls and\n\nprovided the rape kits to law enforcement.\n\n       Pillowcases, sheets, clothing, and other items were collected from the\n\napartment by crime scene investigators. Semen was found on D.N.\u2019s panties and\n\nvaginal swabs, D.K.\u2019s shorts, and a bed sheet.           However, DNA testing was not\n\navailable in 1985, and the case went unsolved for nearly thirty years.\n\n      In January 2006, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (\u201cCMPD\u201d)\n\ncreated a sexual assault cold case unit because the department had approximately\n\n5,000 open rape cases. In 2013, Detective Troy Armstrong reviewed the evidence. He\n\nsubmitted the physical evidence to a crime lab in Beaufort County, South Carolina\n\nfor DNA analysis. DNA analyst Timothy French examined physical evidence for\n\nbiological fluids and DNA. DNA from one male individual was located on D.N.\u2019s\n\npanties, vaginal swabs and shorts, a pillowcase, and bedsheets. The South Carolina\n\ncrime lab established a DNA profile from the evidence collected in 1985. Defendant\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                                    STATE V. WYRICK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nwas developed as a suspect by the CMPD. Detective Armstrong discovered that\n\nDefendant lived within three and a half miles of D.K.\u2019s apartment complex in 1985.\n\n      On September 24, 2014, Defendant was arrested by CMPD. Defendant was\n\nread his Miranda rights, and signed a waiver before speaking with Detective\n\nArmstrong. Defendant informed officers he did not recall the details of that night.\n\nDetective Armstrong obtained buccal swabs from Defendant in a search incident to\n\nhis arrest and sent the samples to the Beaufort County, South Carolina facility for\n\ntesting. Defendant\u2019s DNA profile matched the male DNA profile on the evidence\n\ncollected in 1985.\n\n      On October 13, 2014, Defendant was indicted by a Mecklenburg County grand\n\njury for one count of first degree burglary, two counts of first degree rape, three counts\n\nof first degree sexual offense, and two counts of first degree kidnapping.\n\n      In May 2016, Defendant was tried in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. At\n\ntrial, Defendant stated that he had a \u201cmemorable\u201d consensual sexual encounter with\n\ntwo girls on September 6, 1985 despite not recalling that night while being\n\ninterrogated by Detective Armstrong. The jury found Defendant guilty of two counts\n\nof second degree rape, three counts of second degree sexual offense, and two counts\n\nof second degree kidnapping.       Defendant was sentenced pursuant to the Fair\n\nSentencing Act to five consecutive forty year maximum sentences, and two\n\nconsecutive thirty year maximum sentences which were to begin at the expiration of\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                   STATE V. WYRICK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nDefendant\u2019s federal imprisonment. Defendant was also ordered to register as a sex\n\noffender upon release for a period of thirty years. Defendant timely appealed.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n      Defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly cross-examined him\n\nregarding his post-arrest silence when he testified at trial in violation of Rule 607 of\n\nthe North Carolina Rules of Evidence. Defendant further contends that this allegedly\n\nimproper impeachment resulted in prejudicial error, requiring a new trial.          We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       \u201c[O]ur standard of review for rulings made by the trial court pursuant to Rule\n\n607 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence is abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Banks,\n\n210 N.C. App. 30, 38, 706 S.E.2d 807, 814 (2011) (citation omitted).\n\n      The United States Constitution protects an individual from being \u201ccompelled\n\nin any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. Under\n\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), individuals are guaranteed\n\nprotections under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution\n\nduring a custodial police interrogation. A criminal defendant\u2019s exercise of his right\n\nto remain silent cannot be used against him \u201cto impeach an explanation subsequently\n\noffered at trial.\u201d Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 618, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91, 98 (1976). The\n\nUnited States Supreme Court has given latitude to the several states to \u201cformulate\n\n[their] own rules of evidence to determine when prior silence is so inconsistent with\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f                                   STATE V. WYRICK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\npresent statements that impeachment by reference to such silence is probative.\u201d\n\nJenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 239, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86, 95 (1980).\n\n      The North Carolina Constitution guarantees \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\n\nevery person charged with crime has the right to . . . not be compelled to give self-\n\nincriminating evidence.\u201d N.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 23. \u201cPrior statements of a witness which\n\nare inconsistent with his present testimony are not admissible as substantive\n\nevidence because of their hearsay nature.\u201d State v. Mack, 282 N.C. 334, 339, 193\n\nS.E.2d 71, 75 (1972) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). However, our Supreme\n\nCourt has established longstanding precedent that \u201csuch prior inconsistent\n\nstatements are admissible for the purpose of impeachment.\u201d Id. at 340, 193 S.E.2d\n\nat 75 (citing State v. Chance, 279 N.C. 643, 185 S.E.2d 227 (1971); State v. Britt, 225\n\nN.C. 364, 34 S.E.2d 408 (1945); Stansbury, N.C. Evidence, \u00a7 46 (2d ed. 1963)). \u201cIf the\n\nformer statement fails to mention a material circumstance presently testified to,\n\nwhich it would have been natural to mention in the prior statement, the prior\n\nstatement is sufficiently inconsistent, and is termed an indirect inconsistency.\u201d Id.\n\n(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).\n\n      \u201c \u2018The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party\n\ncalling him.\u2019 \u201d State v.

Ed. 2d 808\n\n(2003). \u201cHowever, extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements may not be used\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f                                  STATE V. WYRICK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nto impeach a witness where the questions concern matters collateral to the issues.\u201d\n\nId. (citing State v. Hunt, 324 N.C. 343, 348, 378 S.E.2d 754, 757 (1989)).\n\n      On cross-examination, impeachment of a witness is proper if it \u201cmerely\n\ninquires into prior inconsistent statements.\u201d State v. Fair, 354 N.C. 131, 156, 557\n\nS.E.2d 500, 519 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), reconsideration\n\ndenied, 354 N.C. 576, 558 S.E.2d 862 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1114, 153 L. Ed.\n\n2d 162 (2002). Further, our Supreme Court has held \u201c[s]uch questioning makes no\n\nunfair use of silence, because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving\n\nMiranda warnings has not been induced to remain silent.\u201d Id. at 156, 557 S.E.2d at\n\n518-19 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Here, Defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination highlighted many specific\n\ndetails of the night of September 6, 1985. Defendant recounted driving an unknown\n\nman home from a local nightclub to an apartment complex, meeting two young women\n\nin the complex\u2019s parking lot, and having a consensual sexual encounter with the two\n\nyoung women. Defendant explained that the two women offered him \u201cwhite liquor,\u201d\n\nmarijuana, and invited him to their apartment.           However, Defendant failed to\n\nmention any of these details when questioned by Detective Armstrong. Instead,\n\nDefendant stated he did not recall the details of that night.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f                                  STATE V. WYRICK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Defendant why he had not\n\ndisclosed this detailed account to the detective during his interview two years prior\n\nto trial. The following transpired:\n\n             THE STATE: Now, when Detective Armstrong interviewed\n             you on September 24th, [2014], . . . he gave you all the\n             warrants and let you have plenty of time to read over the\n             warrants; correct? Because you asked to see them because\n             you wanted to read them.\n\n             DEFENDANT: Yeah, that sounds right.\n\n             THE STATE: And he sat there with you maybe thirty\n             minutes or so while you went over and read them in detail.\n             So you knew exactly what you were being charged with,\n             and the address and the names of the victims, and\n             everything that you were being accused of doing; isn\u2019t that\n             right?\n\n             DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\n\nDefendant stated that he was unable to recall the account because he was medicated\n\nat the time of the interview due to a recent series of operations, and that the\n\nmedication affected his memory during the interview.\n\n      The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was directly related to the subject matter\n\nand details raised in Defendant\u2019s own direct testimony, including the nature of the\n\nsexual encounter itself, the police interrogation, and his prior convictions. Further,\n\nthe inquiry by the prosecutor was not in an effort to proffer substantive evidence to\n\nthe jury, but rather to impeach Defendant with his inconsistent statements. See Fair,\n\n354 N.C. 131, 557 S.E.2d 500; State v. Westbrooks, 345 N.C. 43, 478 S.E.2d 483 (1996).\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f                                  STATE V. WYRICK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nDefendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence is within the exceptions since \u201cno governmental\n\naction induced petitioner to remain silent before arrest.\u201d Westbrooks, 345 N.C. at 63,\n\n478 S.E.2d at 495 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Defendant failed to mention his story of a consensual sexual encounter to the\n\ndetective which he later recalled with a high level of particularity during direct\n\nexamination. Such a \u201cmemorable\u201d encounter would have been natural for Defendant\n\nto recall at the time Detective Armstrong was conducting his investigation; thus, his\n\nprior statement was an \u201cindirect inconsistency.\u201d Further, the prosecutor did not\n\nexploit Defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, but instead merely inquired as to why he\n\ndid not remain consistent between testifying on direct examination and in his\n\ninterview with the detective two years prior. Accordingly, the trial court did not err\n\nwhen it allowed the prosecutor to impeach Defendant with his inconsistent\n\nstatements made at trial and two years prior to the detective.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n       The trial court did not err in allowing the cross-examination of Defendant in\n\nregards to his prior inconsistent statements. We conclude Defendant received a fair\n\ntrial, free from error.\n\n       NO ERROR.\n\n       Judges DILLON and ZACHARY concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",
